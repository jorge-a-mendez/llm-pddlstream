(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to generate 50 stable placements, defined as `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`, for an object (ID 4) on a given surface (0). The object has dimensions `w = 0.0869` and `h = 0.0869` on a surface which is `0.27 x 0.27` centered at the origin.
           
           To be considered stable, the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) needs to remain entirely within the surface bounds. The object's AABB changes with its rotation, `theta`. I need to account for this change using `W = w * abs(cos(theta)) + h * abs(sin(theta))` and `H = w * abs(sin(theta)) + h * abs(cos(theta))`. Given that `w` and `h` are very close, I expect `W` and `H` not to change much with `theta`.
           
           First, since the dimensions are nearly square, a uniform distribution of placements is probably sufficient. So, I will focus on the main orientations: `theta = 0` (upright) and `theta = pi/2` (sideways). I will then construct a grid of `x` and `y` positions, using the fact that both ranges for placement are approximately `0.183`.
           
           For `theta = 0`, I will sample both `x` and `y` from `{-0.08, -0.04, 0, 0.04, 0.08}`. This gives me `5 * 5 = 25` positions. Given that the object is nearly a square, with `w=h`, I can do the same for `theta = pi/2`. This also gives me `5 * 5 = 25` placements. I am, therefore, guaranteed to remain within my stable placement restrictions. The resulting plan is that `5 * 5` placements are at `theta = 0` and `5*5` at `theta = pi/2`, resulting in the required number of total placements.

(Thoughts: **My Approach to Placing Object 8:**
           
           Okay, I've got a new placement request. I need to position object ID 8, which is a nearly square object, onto surface 0 without it colliding with the existing object ID 4. I've already confirmed the placement for object 4, so I'll start by taking that into consideration.
           
           Firstly, I will compute and store the extents of object 4, which is currently at (-0.08, -0.08). Then, I will compute the allowed bounds of the available surface and the dimensions of the new object.
           
           I need to come up with 50 stable placements. Since both objects are nearly square, I can start with `theta = 0` for object 8. With a square object, the AABB does not change with different rotation angles, so that simplifies things.
           
           Next, I need to check for collision.  I have object 4's AABB, so I'll create a grid of potential `(x, y)` coordinates for object 8's center within the valid surface range. For each candidate location, I'll calculate object 8's AABB.
           
           To ensure no collision, I will check that the ranges of x and y for object 8's AABB does not overlap with that of object 4's.
           
           I will start by placing object 8 to the right or above object 4.
           For a non-colliding placement, I need to ensure  `x_8 > 0.01025` and `y_8 >= 0.02`. I will use a grid to generate `x_8` in `(0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08)` and y in range `[-0.08, -0.06, -0.04, -0.02, 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08]`.
           And second set will use y>=0.02 and x=[-0.08, -0.06, -0.04, -0.02, 0.0]. 
           This will give me 56 placements which is sufficient to pick the first 50.
           
           Finally, I'll provide these non-colliding placements to the system. If it fails, I'll need to go back and reassess, perhaps considering alternative rotations.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0, avoiding collisions with previously placed objects, specifically IDs 4 and 8.  Object 5 is a square with a constant AABB dimension of 0.07698818850795985. The surface itself is defined by the bounding box `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           I'll assume a rotation of zero degrees for object 5, simplifying the process.  The key is to determine valid center points (x, y) for object 5.  Given the surface constraints and the object's dimensions, the allowed x and y center coordinates must be within the range `[-0.0965, 0.0965]`.
           
           To avoid collisions, I've analyzed the AABBs of the existing objects.  Object 4 is located roughly in the lower-left, and Object 8 is in the lower-middle section of the surface. Their AABBs have been pre-calculated. I noticed that for `y_center` values greater than or equal to `0.01`, the potential placement of object ID 5 would not overlap on the y axis with the existing objects, as confirmed by collision calculations.
           
           Therefore, my strategy is as follows: I'll create a grid of possible center points for object 5. I will create a set of five y-values, ranging from `0.01` to `0.09` with steps of `0.02`, and a set of ten x-values, ranging from `-0.09` to `0.09` with steps of `0.02`. Combining these values will create `5 * 10 = 50` valid stable placements for object ID 5 without collisions, where all `y_c` values are equal to or greater than 0.01, and with x coordinate values within `[-0.09, 0.09]`.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 7 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 7 on surface 0, ensuring no collisions with previously placed objects (IDs 4, 8, and 5) while respecting the surface boundaries.
           
           First, I need to understand object 7's dimensions. It's nearly square, with sides of approximately 0.0835. To simplify calculations, I'll start by assuming a rotation of `theta = 0`.  This means the center of object 7 needs to be within the surface's bounds: x and y coordinates both within [-0.0932, 0.0932].
           
           Next, I determined the occupied regions of the existing objects (AABB). The existing objects primarily occupy the lower-left portion of the surface.  Specifically:
           
           *   Object 4: x=[-0.123, -0.036], y=[-0.123, -0.036]
           *   Object 8: x=[-0.026, 0.066], y=[-0.126, -0.033]
           *   Object 5: x=[-0.128, -0.051], y=[-0.028, 0.048]
           
           To avoid collisions, I need to place object 7 where it won't overlap with any of these AABBs. My strategy is to position object 7 above all the existing objects, since they primarily occupy the lower portion of the surface.
           
           Based on these AABBs, I calculated that the y-coordinate of object 7's center must be greater than 0.0902 to be above object 5. And it must be less than 0.0932 due to the surface limit. This gives a very narrow Y space. I used values of `0.0905, 0.0915, 0.0925`. To make more space I can consider `theta = pi/2`. 
           
           To achieve the 50 placements, I'll use the following sets:
           
           **Set 1: `theta = 0` (30 placements)**
           
           *   y:  0.0905, 0.0915, 0.0925 (3 values)
           *   x: [-0.09, -0.07, -0.05, -0.03, -0.01, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09] (10 values)
           
           **Set 2: `theta = pi/2` (20 placements)**

           Okay, here's the plan. I need to figure out 50 stable positions for object ID 6 on surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into objects 4, 8, 5, and 7. The surface is a simple rectangle. Object 6 is a little square.
           
           First, I figured out the exact space available on the surface by calculating the boundary range for the object's center, considering its size.  Then, I determined the dimensions, specifically the "half" size to simplify overlap analysis, considering its size, `0.0703`.
           
           Next, I nailed down the possible placement area. I can't let object 6's center wander outside of `[-0.0998, 0.0998]` for both x and y coordinates.
           
           The real challenge is avoiding collisions. I needed the bounding boxes (AABBs) for each of the objects already placed. With this, I now have the occupied spaces in both the X and Y dimensions.
           
           My first thought was finding a clear spot to fit Object 6 completely - this did not work. Too much overlap. But I quickly realized that because I'm working with a square object, there are "gaps" in one direction when others overlap.
           
           I then did a fine-grained analysis of the combined "exclusion zone" created by the existing objects. I calculated the min and max X and Y occupied, and then I calculated the surface boundaries.
           
           I started looking for possible regions where I could place object 6, I realized that I couldn't place it to the right of the objects on the right side. And the same on the left side of the object on the left side.
           
           I determined that, because the objects are very tightly packed, the best strategy is to place the object such that it does not overlap with any of the previous objects.
           
           I defined X and Y ranges of overlap for Object 6. Then I determined that it could *only* overlap in X, and I had to pick Y in a non-overlapping region. The maximum height/depth of Object 6 is `0.07`, thus there is no "space" to fit it above or below others - the highest and lowest Y points are already occupied.
           
           My insight was to identify a narrow vertical strip where it could fit, using `y_center = 0.07` for example, placing it vertically without overlapping any objects, by calculating a "safe range" to set `x`. I was aiming to ensure no overlap by ensuring that `x` centers where in ranges `x_center > -0.013`.
           
           As I proceeded, I checked the range, to confirm it didn't overlap the AABBs of any existing objects.
           
           I ultimately created a placement strategy where the X-center is between `0.04` and `0.09`, and the Y-center between `0.005` and `0.095`. I know this gives me 60 options, so I will select the first 50. All 50 placements use `theta=0`.
           
           I double checked my bounding box ranges.
