(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 4) on a square surface.  The surface is a square with side length 0.27, and the object is a square with side length roughly 0.0985. "Stable" means the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) must be fully contained within the surface's AABB.
           
           To ensure stability, I need to consider the object's rotation. When rotated by an angle theta, the square object's AABB also becomes a square, but its side length, 's_rot', changes based on the formula: s_rot = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))).
           
           The minimum s_rot (s) occurs at 0 degrees rotation, and the maximum (s * sqrt(2)) at 45 degrees. The object will fit on the surface in any orientation.
           
           My strategy to generate 50 distinct placements is:
           1.  Choose ten angles (0 to PI/2, covering unique AABB shapes) and calculate s_rot for each.
           2.  Determine the valid range for the object's center (x, y) coordinates based on s_rot and surface boundaries.
           3.  For each valid region, I will create placements at 5 distinct points (center, and four roughly in the "quadrants" of this region), resulting in 50 placements.

(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Placing Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with placing a new object (ID 5) on Surface 0, which is a square. Surface 0 has bounds of (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). I already know the position of a previous object (ID 4) on this surface, which is also a square, and I need to make sure the new object doesn't collide with it. The key challenge here is avoiding collisions while ensuring that I can still fit 50 unique positions. This makes a careful placement strategy essential.
           
           First things first, I calculate object 5's size (side: 0.074). I also know the center of object 4 is the origin, (0,0), and that the side length is 0.09849. To determine the allowed locations for object 5, I focus on calculating the "forbidden" region around object 4, the area where object 5's center can't be. This "forbidden zone" expands with increasing rotation.
           
           Given that I need to find 50 placements, I'll need to explore different orientations for object 5. However, since the object is a square, the most "compact" orientations where it might be easiest to fit are at 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees. This is because at those angles, the object's AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) is smallest and can best fit in the available spaces.
           
           I need to come up with a strategy to generate possible positions. I have decided to focus on using four angles where the object could be placed: 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees. To handle the different possible placements, I will generate placements for each of the four angles and check if the placement results in the object 5 colliding with object 4, and remove the positions that do. If the objects do not overlap, I keep the placement.
           
           To do this, I will need to use a function I've written to check each combination of orientation and position. If for a given orientation, I am unable to generate 13 valid non-colliding positions, then I can move on to the next.
           
           For each of these four angles, the available placement area is a "cross" of rectangles. To come up with placements, I will first calculate the available width and height of the strips, and then, for each angle and a variety of center points, I can check each of the center points for each of the four angles.
           
           The center points that I have decided to check are: the center of each of the four rectangular bands, two points each side, and the middle point of each band to ensure sufficient positions and diversity. I will check that these points do not overlap with object 4. This robust method will result in 16 non-colliding locations for each orientation.  Since I need 50, I will pick the first 50 unique placements that do not collide to ensure the minimum needed.
