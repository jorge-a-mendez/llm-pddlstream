               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unattainable Due to Base Configuration Mismatch**
           
           Okay, so the objective is clear: I need to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`. Simple enough, conceptually. Currently, they're all resting on `v11`.  My initial thought is to employ a standard pick-and-place sequence. However, a deeper look reveals a critical issue related to the robot's base configuration.
           
           Here's the problem:  The "kin" predicates, which define possible pick and place actions, all require a base configuration indicated by a continuous parameter, specifically `#o3`.  To pick or place an object, the robot needs to be at a base configuration that allows for it.  The "kin" definitions indicate the required base configuration is a dynamic variable `#o3`. My current base state, however, is `atbconf(v3)`.
           
           The crucial snag is that the only "move_base" action available is a no-op; it keeps the base configuration at `v3`. This is a big problem because the preconditions for the pick and place actions require `atbconf(#o3)`. Since `#o3` is a continuous parameter (and therefore distinct from the named constant `v3`), the single `move_base` action available to me can't change the robot's base from `v3` to anything else, including `#o3`.
           
           In short, there's no way to reach the required base configuration (`#o3`) for picking up or placing any object. As a result, the preconditions for any pick-and-place operation can't be satisfied, and the goal state is unreachable with the current actions available.  There's no path to achieve the objective of having `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` on `v16`.
