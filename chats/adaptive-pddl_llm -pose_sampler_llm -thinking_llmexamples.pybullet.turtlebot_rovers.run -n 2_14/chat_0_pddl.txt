User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Finding Robot Base Positions**
           
           My goal is to locate 25 valid locations for a robot base around a specific target point, adhering to several constraints. First, the base needs to be within 4 units of the target and situated within the environment's boundaries, specifically between -2.5 and 2.5 for both x and y coordinates. The robot's orientation will automatically adjust to face the target.
           
           I must work around a collection of fixed, rectangular obstacles that could block the path or obstruct the view. A significant challenge is a central vertical wall at x=0. Since the target's x-coordinate is positive, valid base locations need to be positioned on the right side of the x=0 wall to avoid occlusion.
           
           To identify these locations, I employ a multi-step process:
           
           1.  **Circular Sampling:** I start by generating positions on concentric circles around the target, using various radii. This helps me explore the space evenly.
           2.  **Grid Search:** If I don't find enough positions using circular sampling, I then conduct a grid scan. Initially, I use a coarse grid, but if necessary, I refine the grid to identify a denser set of potential locations.
           
           For each candidate base location, I check several criteria: the distance to the target, adherence to the environment's boundaries, unobstructed line of sight to the target, and collision-free status with fixed obstacles. This ensures that the chosen positions meet all the requirements.
           
           I prioritize finding diverse valid positions, aiming for 25 distinct locations. The central wall significantly affects the search; bases are essentially constrained to one side of it, depending on the target's location.
           
           To ensure I have 25 viable positions, I keep iterating with progressively finer search criteria if needed. The aim is to find 25 valid and unique robot base positions.
