User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.681, -0.147), (-1.541, -0.007)).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unachievable Goal: A Deep Dive into Configuration Constraints**
           
           Okay, here's the deal: I've been tasked with crafting a plan to achieve this new axiom, `new-axiom@0()`.  It hinges on getting some images and analyses, which is standard stuff. Breaking it down, I need the rovers, `v12` and `v14`, to grab images (`receivedimage`) of objectives `v17` and `v18`, and then analyze rocks and soil (represented by `receivedanalysis`). No problem, right?
           
           Well, that's where things get tricky.  To get those images and analyses, I need to use actions like `send_image` and `send_analysis`. Those, in turn, rely on `take_image` and `sample_rock`, respectively.  And here's the kicker: these actions all depend on the rovers being at *specific configurations* as defined by predicates like `imagevisible` and `above`.  Specifically, I need the rovers at configurations labeled `#o3`, `#o5`, or `#o0`.  
           
           Now, the initial state is pretty clear. The rovers are currently at configurations `v13` and `v15` – indicated by `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`. The rub is: *I can't change that*. The only "move" actions available are self-loops: the rovers just stay put.  I can't tell them to *go* to `#o3`, `#o5`, or `#o0`, even though the geometry of the scene might make those perfectly valid configurations (if you give those coordinates of these '#o*' parameters). I have `conf(rover, #o*)` facts in the initial state, *but that's not enough*. The `atconf` predicate means "is currently at". I can only change this state if I can make `atconf` true for another configuration.
           
           So, since I can't *get* to the configurations I need because the `move` actions are limited, all the necessary preconditions for actions like `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` remain unmet.
           
           In short: I'm stuck. My path is blocked. There's no way to reach the required configurations, so the goal is simply unachievable with the given constraints.  I can't generate a plan because a plan is not possible.
