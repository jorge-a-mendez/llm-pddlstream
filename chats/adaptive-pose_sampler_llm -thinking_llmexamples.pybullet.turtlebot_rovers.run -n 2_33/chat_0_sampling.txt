(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 25 valid positions for a robot's base, given a target point and a set of fixed obstacles. The robot must be within a certain range of the target and within world limits. Crucially, I have to ensure line-of-sight to the target, which adds a layer of geometric reasoning. I'm given the following constraints: a world with boundaries defined by AABBs, a range limit of 4 units from the target, and a constraint on the robot's orientation (it will automatically face the target). I’m also told that if I get the same target again in the future, it might be because a previous position collided with something I don’t know about *yet*, so I need to be prepared to learn and adapt. For now, it’s just the fixed obstacles I need to worry about.
           
           **My Approach:**
           
           1.  **Analyze the Scene:** I started by understanding the geometry of the environment: the world boundaries, some external walls, and the most critical obstacle – a vertical wall in the center of the scene along the y-axis, defined by the AABB `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`. This wall, since it intersects the y-axis, is going to be problematic because the target is situated at `(0.0, -2.0)`. There are also many smaller obstacles scattered around, but the central wall is a major concern.
           
           2.  **Constraint Satisfaction:** For each candidate position `(px, py)` I generate, I need to check these constraints:
               *   **Distance to Target:** Make sure the robot’s distance from the target point doesn't exceed the maximum range of 4.
               *   **World Limits:** Ensure the robot is within the `x: [-2.5, 2.5]` and `y: [-2.5, 2.5]` bounds.
               *   **No Collision with Fixed Obstacles:** The robot's position must not be inside any of the obstacles' AABBs (except the boundaries).
               *   **Line-of-Sight:** The line connecting the robot's position to the target point *must not* intersect any fixed obstacle. This is my biggest challenge.
           
           3.  **Generating the Positions (and Handling that Central Wall):**  I’ll sample positions around the target point, making sure to avoid the obstacles. I plan to use a circular sampling approach, placing points at varying distances (radii) and angles around the target. But here’s the tricky part: the target is located *right* on that central wall!  The central wall effectively divides the area into two zones, and for line-of-sight, the robot cannot have its line cross that segment.
           
               *   **The central wall issue:** My approach to this is this: The target is on an axis with the wall.  If the robot is on the other side of the wall, there is no way to have line-of-sight. Therefore, the robot *must* be positioned very close to that central wall. But... the point collision detection will reject points exactly on the wall, so it must be close to it, but not touching the obstacle to maintain line-of-sight. For this, I used a simplified and robust AABB intersection check.
           
           4.  **Special Treatment for Line of Sight:**  I've decided that when the target point falls within an obstacle's AABB, that *specific* obstacle is considered transparent *for the target's specific position only*.
           
               *   I'll generate a set of candidate positions.
               *   For each candidate position, I check if it's within world limits and range.
               *   I check if it is within an obstacle, in which case it is rejected.
               *   I perform line-of-sight test to confirm the path from the robot to the target point is unblocked
               *   If it passes all checks, it's a valid position.
           
           **In Summary:** I'll generate points in a circular pattern around the target point. I made sure to implement the above rules so that the results I get are valid, and consider the important case where the target lies on a blocking obstacle. I hope this covers all of the requirements.

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning for Generating Valid Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, the user wants me to find 25 valid base positions for a robot to target the point (2.2, 0.4). I need to stick to the same approach I've used before, which is pretty solid.
           
           First, I need to know the playing field: the target point, the robot's maximum range (4), and the world limits (x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5]). There are a bunch of obstacles. I have all the obstacle coordinates defined as AABB's. The crucial part is to correctly interpret the AABB's as obstacles and how to interpret LOS blockage vs collision.
           
           *   **Generate Candidates:** My strategy is to use polar coordinates centered on the target. I'll sweep out circles with radii from 0.5 up to about 3.8 (a bit less than max range). I'll also use angular increments of 10 degrees. I will then add some positions by increasing angular density to 5 degrees, if needed to find at least 25.
           *   **Filter the Candidates:** For each candidate position, I'll filter out the bad ones. This involves a few key checks:
               1.  **World Limits:** Make sure the position stays within the world's bounds.
               2.  **Max Range:** This is already implicitly handled by how I generate the radii.
               3.  **Base Collision:** The robot's base can't be inside any of the obstacles. I have an `is_point_in_aabb` function, and a list of internal fixed obstacles for collisions (5-20), excluding the outer boundary walls (0-4).
               4.  **Line-of-Sight (LOS):** This is the core. I need to ensure there are no obstacles blocking a straight line from a potential robot base position to the target. I have a `line_intersects_aabb` function to check this segment-AABB intersection correctly, with accurate checks.
                   *   Important: The `segment_intersects_segment` now uses strict LOS, requiring *through* an obstacle, not just touching.
               5.  **Target Inside Special Handling:** Special cases: if the target (2.2, 0.4) happens to be inside a fixed obstacle, it implies a special condition: *only* if the target is in the obstacle `5`, I'll consider that obstacle transparent. Otherwise, any other obstacle that contains the target automatically blocks the view (which is probably rare given the target location).
           
           I will use my earlier code, with the adjusted handling of edge-cases, for more robust implementation. The key is in the `line_of_sight_blocked` function and the accurate filtering.
