               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to get these five objects – v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18 –  *on* v20. This means each object needs to be supported by v20 at a specific pose. Based on the initial state, it's clear the target pose for each object is #o2.  Currently, all the objects are stacked on v11, each at a different pose.
           
           My usual approach would be to pick each object, one by one, and place it onto v20. However, a major issue arises: *the base configuration*. The *kin* facts (which define the robot's motion capabilities) for both pick and place actions require the robot to be in base config #o3. However, the initial state shows the robot is at base config v3, and the only possible move action is a self-loop from v3 to v3.  There is no way to transition the base configuration from v3 to #o3 given the available actions.
           
           This lack of movement capability directly blocks any *pick* or *place* actions.  Since I can't pick up the objects, I can't place them on v20. The `atbconf(#o3)` precondition within *pick* and *place* actions becomes the critical blocker. Therefore, I conclude the initial plan to achieve the goal state is infeasible with the current set of available actions and facts. The goal state cannot be reached.
