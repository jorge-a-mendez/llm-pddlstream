           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.165, 0.453, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.897, -0.443).

           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.192, -0.334, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.917).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning for the Plan**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with getting four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) onto surface v18. They're all currently on surface v11, and the goal is to have them *on* v18. I've got to use the robot arm v4 and its current configuration, with these four objects being "graspable" and "stackable".
           
           My initial thinking is to pick each object and place it on v18. Since there are these continuous poses at play (which I'll need to specify), and I'm using the `kin` and `supported` predicates, it looks like it's going to be a pick-and-place sequence. The `atpose` predicate and `on` axioms are key here. I will move the robot's base to a suitable pose `#o3`.
           
           I see that the robot's arm, v4, is hand-empty, and there's a grasping and arm trajectory already defined (based on `kin`). There's also a common continuous target pose `#o2` on v18 for all four objects. All of the actions are given, so I don't need to choose any parameters beyond setting the target poses.
           
           I need a base motion to make `atbconf(#o3)` true, since the initial state has `atbconf(v3)`. I'll need to move the base from the start configuration `v3` to the base configuration `#o3`, and then move the robot's arm to complete the pick and place motions.
           
           So, the plan: 1) Move base, 2) Pick-up object 3) Place object. I'll need to make sure to move the base *once* and then proceed to picking and placing. Each `place` action sets `canmove` to true again. This means that after a base motion I can perform the pick and places one after another.
           
           I'm making a key assumption here: I need to choose one continuous value, #o2, for the target pose on v18 for *each* object. Because `#o2` is an undefined parameter used in the `kin` and `supported` facts, and the prompt implies I need a continuous value when placing all objects simultaneously, I think I need to provide a separate `(#o2 v8 v18) (x1 y1 z1 theta1)` for each object.
           
           To determine these placements, I'll need to consider collisions. It looks like the target surface, v18, is a small surface compared to the others and the current starting positions. I'll need a way to ensure the placement is collision-free on v18 with respect to initial positions of objects, as well as avoid collisions with the target v18.
           
           So I need to provide those poses.
           
           Here's the plan I've landed on:
           1.  Move the base.
           2.  Pick up v8. Place v8.
           3.  Pick up v12. Place v12.
           4.  Pick up v14. Place v14.
           5.  Pick up v16. Place v16.
           
           For each object, I need a continuous coordinate `#o2` to be specified such that the object can be placed and the robot motions are valid (which I will calculate based on AABBs). This is a simple pick and place plan with a common motion for all objects.
