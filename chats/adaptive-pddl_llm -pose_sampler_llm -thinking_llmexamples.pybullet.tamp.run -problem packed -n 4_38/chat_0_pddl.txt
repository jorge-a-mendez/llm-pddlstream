(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for Object ID 4 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, I've got a plan. I need to generate 50 stable placements for a rectangular object (ID 4) of size (0.07879342236812453, 0.07879342236812459) on a square surface defined by the points (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135).  
           
           My goal is to find placements described by (surf_idx, theta, x, y), ensuring the object is fully contained within the surface boundaries and is stable. Since there are no collisions right now, that's straightforward. The key is the stability constraint.  For a flat surface, the center of mass must be within the surface's bounding box.  
           
           The surface is 0.27 x 0.27 centered at (0, 0).  The size of the object is essentially a square. I've calculated that even with rotation at 45 degrees, the object's effective dimensions is basically the same, with the diagonal width being 0.1114. The half-dimensions that I'll need to use to figure out the acceptable center placements is 0.055711057 (derived from the calculation `s_sqrt2` * 0.5 where s is the approximated short length) for the greatest amount of rotation.   The surface bounds require the center to be between -0.079288943 and 0.079288943 for both x and y.
           
           Since sx and sy is so similar to each other, the placement bounds is similar regardless of the rotation, which simplifies everything. My key strategy is to place the center of mass in a range to satisfy all the rotations. The center must be within  approximately [-0.079, 0.079] on both axes.
           
           I've decided to generate a grid of positions within that range and then assign a different rotation angle (theta) to each position.  For the main grid, I am going to have 7 points on both x and y. The x and y values will be linearly spaced between -0.079 to 0.079. I will also generate a list of angles ranging from 0 to 23*pi/12 (each incrementing by pi/12 radians) to achieve variety.
           
           After the grid generation, the 49 distinct placement with unique theta angles are generated, with an additional one in the center and with pi/8 radians to complete the 50.

(Thoughts: **My Solution for Placing Object ID 6**
           
           Okay, so I've got this new object, ID 6, that I need to place, and I need 50 stable placements on surface 0, while also making sure it doesn't collide with the previously placed object, ID 4. I've already confirmed a successful placement for ID 4, so I know the layout of the space.
           
           First, I figured out the dimensions and the maximum rotated extents of ID 6 to figure out the "safe zone" for its center. Surface 0 is a square, and I know object ID 4 is within it. Using my expertise, I've calculated the boundaries of the safe zone: it's roughly a smaller square within the larger surface, centered at (0, 0), with each side around 0.154m and a maximum possible value for x,y coordinates to be at ~0.0773m.
           
           Object 4 is placed around (-0.079, -0.079), with dimensions approximately (0.078, 0.078).
           I took this AABB into account, so that means the new object should avoid placing its AABB at those coordinates.
           
           The challenge is to generate a diverse set of 50 placements. I decided to make sure to cover the 0 to pi range for theta.
           
           I created a grid of potential (x, y) coordinates for ID 6's center, evenly spaced within the safe zone and then looped over a set of rotations from 0 to pi.
           For each (x, y, theta) combination, I calculated the resulting AABB of ID 6, and I checked if:
           
           1.  It stayed within the surface.
           2.  It didn't overlap with the bounding box of ID 4.
           
           I implemented this process in Python and found an ordered way to scan through the coordinate space to prioritize less crowded regions. It should be relatively robust.
           I have a good working process to generate 50 non-colliding and valid placements for object ID 6.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Placing Object ID 5**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan for placing this object – it's a bit of a spatial puzzle, but I've got a strategy.  The main challenge is that Object ID 5 is relatively large, and I need to find 50 stable, collision-free placements on Surface 0, taking into account the existing objects (IDs 4 and 6). Here’s what I’m thinking:
           
           First, I need to get the lay of the land. I have the geometry of Surface 0, which is a square. Object 5 is also square, with dimensions `0.0958 x 0.0958`.  I know the positions, dimensions, and AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) of the obstacle objects (ID 4 and ID 6).
           
           The key is avoiding collisions. I’ll be using rotation (theta) to get different orientations for Object 5. Because it's a square, its effective size changes depending on the rotation.  The maximum size occurs at a 45-degree angle.  So, I need to compute the *effective* width and height (`W_eff` and `H_eff`) depending on theta, to ensure it doesn’t collide with anything. I've figured out the "guaranteed contained area" where the center of object 5 can be placed while staying on the surface.
           
           Then I identified the "forbidden" areas around the existing objects, by calculating their AABBs. I'll need to check the AABB of my object placement to ensure it doesn't overlap those of the existing objects.
           
           I've determined that the best approach is to carefully plan placement for `theta=0`, which is aligned with the x and y axes. I also realized that even in such small rotations, there's always an effective overlap in some dimensions because of how tight this placement is, which means I should stick with `theta=0`.
           
           After extensive analysis I found a way. The surface contains a small safe area. Here’s the deal: to avoid collisions, the center of Object 5 *must* fall within this area, and for the specific arrangement given, only placements in a very thin, specific rectangular region will work. This region is approximately `x in [0.0083, 0.087]` and `y in [-0.087, -0.079]`.  I'll then be able to systematically fill this area with `theta = 0` placements, because the dimensions for all `theta` are equal for a square object.
           I'll create a grid of points within this rectangle, creating a total of 50 stable placements, all non-colliding, and fulfilling the requirements.
           
           This solution should be effective given these specific constraints!
