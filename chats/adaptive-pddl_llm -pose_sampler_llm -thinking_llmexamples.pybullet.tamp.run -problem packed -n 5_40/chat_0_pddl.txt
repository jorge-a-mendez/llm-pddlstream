           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Placing the Object: A Strategic Approach**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for an object (ID 6, dimensions approximately 0.077 x 0.077 meters) on a square surface centered at (0,0) with side length 0.27 meters.  My expertise lies in efficiently and robustly generating such placements, ensuring they are diverse and valid.
           
           The key to this is understanding how rotation affects the object's occupied area. When an object rotates, its bounding box expands. To find stable placements, I need to know where the center of the object can go without going outside the surface.  This is done by using the effective width and effective height, which depend on the rotation angle.  I used the formulas:
           
           *   `w_eff = w * abs(cos(theta)) + h * abs(sin(theta))`
           *   `h_eff = w * abs(sin(theta)) + h * abs(cos(theta))`
           
           Given that the object is almost square, I expect the effective bounding box dimensions to be similar in size when rotated by 45 degrees.
           
           My strategy involved:
           
           1.  **Angle Diversity:** I selected a range of angles (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3\*pi/8, pi/2, and then additional angles).  This ensures the placements cover various orientations.
           2.  **Valid Center Range:** For each angle, I calculated the effective width and height, then determined the valid range for the object's center `(x, y)` to keep it within the surface.
           3.  **Grid Placement:** Within the valid center range for most of the angles, I distributed the center in a 3x3 grid for the 'x' and 'y' coordinates to obtain 9 placements for each angle (and then I made 5 placements at the center point with different angles) for variety.
           
           Here are the 50 calculated placements, formatted as `(surface_index, angle, x_center, y_center)`:

(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Placing Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new object, ID 5, that I need to place on surface 0, and it can't collide with object 6, which is already placed in the bottom-left corner. Object 5 is almost square, just like object 6, but slightly bigger.  I need to find 50 valid placements.
           
           My plan is pretty straightforward:
           
           1.  **Angle Diversity:** I'm going to try different angles for object 5.  I'll start with 0 degrees (no rotation) and go up to pi radians (180 degrees) in steps of pi/16. I'm using more angles to get a good spread, ensuring I cover a diverse set of orientations.
           2.  **Valid Placement Zones:** For each angle, I need to figure out where object 5 *can* be placed without going off the surface.  I'll calculate the effective width and height (`w_eff`, `h_eff`) of object 5, accounting for its size and rotation. Then, I can determine the valid range for the center point (x, y) of object 5.
           3.  **Grid Points:** Within those valid ranges, I'll create a 3x3 grid of candidate (x, y) positions. I'll make sure to get `x` values in the center and to the right, and `y` values in the center and to the top.
           4.  **Collision Check:** This is the crucial part. For each candidate position, I'll calculate the *axis-aligned bounding box* (AABB) of object 5. Then, I'll compare that AABB to the AABB of object 6. If they overlap, it's a collision, and I reject that placement.
           5.  **Prioritization:** Since object 6 is stuck in the bottom-left, I'm prioritizing trying placements that put object 5 towards the top right.  This should reduce collision checks.
           
           I'm being careful to handle edge cases in my calculations. Also, I'm checking for exact duplicates to handle corner cases correctly.
           
           I'll keep generating and checking placements until I have 50 non-colliding options. It's a systematic approach, ensuring I find a good variety of placements while avoiding collisions. This is the strategy I've landed on.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**
           
           Alright, the task is clear: I need to find 50 stable placements for a new, nearly square object (ID 7) on a given surface (Surface 0).  The tricky part is avoiding collisions with two previously placed objects (Object 6 and Object 5). Since I have some expertise in this, I'll leverage a common strategy: iterating through a range of angles and systematically testing candidate placements within the surface's boundaries.
           
           **Detailed Strategy and Calculation**
           
           My plan unfolds in the following stages:
           
           1.  **Angle Iteration:** I will sweep through a set of angles, from 0 to π, with a reasonable step size (e.g., pi/16 or pi/12), to explore different orientations for object 7.
           2.  **AABB Calculations:** For each angle, I'll calculate the *effective* width and height of object 7's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box). This effectively adjusts the object's dimensions based on its rotation using the absolute values of cosine and sine components.
           3.  **Valid Placement Ranges:** Next, I'll determine the valid range of *x* and *y* center coordinates where object 7's AABB will fit entirely within surface 0.
           4.  **Candidate Generation:** Within these valid ranges, I'll generate a grid of candidate center points. To promote diversity, I will use a 3x3 grid for each angle, based on a linear interpolation approach.
           5.  **AABB for Placement:** For each candidate (angle, x, y), I'll calculate the exact AABB for the rotated object.
           6.  **Collision Detection:** Crucially, I'll check for any collisions between the candidate AABB and the AABBs of both Object 6 and Object 5. A collision is a simple interval overlap check in both *x* and *y* dimensions.
           7.  **Placement Selection:** If a candidate AABB is collision-free and within the surface, I'll add it to my list of valid placements. I will continue until I reach 50 valid placements.
           
           **Refinement and Optimization**
           
           The provided data also confirms the AABBs for the other objects: object 6 is located bottom-left and object 5 is top-right. I've double-checked the AABB calculations to make sure those fixed values are correct and will be used to filter placements.
           
           **Implementation Details and Considerations**
           
           *   I'll utilize a systematic search strategy to generate placements. Using a 3x3 grid means I effectively test at *min*, *center*, and *max* positions for each X and Y coordinate, allowing for an even distribution of testing.
           *   Once I have 50 placements, I will return with these 50 valid placements as an output.
           *   Given that the new object is only slightly rotated compared to the others and the available space is relatively large, I'm confident that this approach will yield a sufficient number of valid placements.
           *   I will double check the calculations for xmin, xmax, ymin and ymax, as these are critical components in verifying that valid placements do not overlap.
           *   If, for some reason, the strategy doesn't yield enough results, I can revisit the angle step or the grid resolution to get valid placement points.
           *   To keep the code simple I'll implement a collision check with an efficient method.
           
           This is a well-established method, and with the details in place, I'm ready to proceed with generating these stable placements.
