           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes three graspable objects: `v12`, `v8`, and `v15`. `v12` is at pose `v13` and supported by `v14`. `v8` is at pose `v9` and supported by `v11`. `v15` is at pose `v16` and supported by `v11`. All three objects can be stacked on `v10` and `v18`. The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both are handempty and at their respective configurations `v5` and `v7`. The robot's base is at configuration `v3`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true.
           From the initial state, we know that `type(v12, v17)`. So, if `on(v12, v18)` is achieved, the goal will be satisfied.
           `on(v12, v18)` can be satisfied if `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)` are true for some pose `?p`.
           We already have `supported(v12, v13, v14)` and `atpose(v12, v13)`. We also have `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`.
           If we can place `v12` on `v18` at pose `#o2`, then the goal will be met.
           However, there are no pick or place actions available in the provided action instances. The only available action is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, which does not change the state of the objects or affect the goal in any way.
           
           Since there are no actions to pick and place objects, and the goal requires moving an object (`v12`) to a different support (`v18`), the goal is unreachable.
           
           --Plan--:

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The scene describes three graspable objects: `v12`, `v8`, and `v15`. `v12` is at pose `v13` and supported by `v14`. `v8` is at pose `v9` and supported by `v11`. `v15` is at pose `v16` and supported by `v11`. All three objects can be stacked on `v10` and `v18`. The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both are handempty and at their respective configurations `v5` and `v7`. The robot's base is at configuration `v3`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true.
           From the initial state, we know that `type(v12, v17)`. So, if `on(v12, v18)` is achieved, the goal will be satisfied.
           `on(v12, v18)` can be satisfied if `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)` are true for some pose `?p`.
           We already have `supported(v12, v13, v14)` and `atpose(v12, v13)`. We also have `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`.
           If we could place `v12` on `v18` at pose `#o2`, then the goal would be met.
           
           However, the only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not allow the robot to manipulate objects, such as picking or placing them. Therefore, it is impossible to move `v12` from its current support `v14` to `v18`. Since the robot cannot change the support of `v12`, the condition `on(v12, v18)` cannot be achieved, and consequently, the overall goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable with the given actions.
