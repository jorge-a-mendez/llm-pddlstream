           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable with Limited Actions**
           
           My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of type `v17` be "on" `v18`. Initially, I identified `v8` and `v12` as potential candidates since both are of type `v17`. To satisfy the "on" condition, I need to ensure the object is both supported by `v18` at a particular pose and actually *at* that pose.
           
           Analyzing the initial state, I can see that `v8` is currently at `v9` and `v12` is at `v13`.  Although both are supported by `v18` at pose `#o2`, neither is *currently* at a pose where they are "on" `v18`.  Therefore, moving either of these objects to `#o2` is essential.
           
           Ordinarily, I would employ a standard `pick` and `place` sequence to achieve this repositioning. However, a crucial constraint is that I can only use the action instance `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This severely limits my options, as `pick` and `place` are *not* permitted.
           
           The allowed action modifies the base configuration to no effect. It merely sets a `canmove()` flag to false, which doesn't assist me in moving the object. Since I'm restricted to `move_base`, I cannot change the object's current poses.
           
           This impasse means that the necessary repositioning cannot occur. Therefore, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable within the limitations imposed by the permitted action instance.
