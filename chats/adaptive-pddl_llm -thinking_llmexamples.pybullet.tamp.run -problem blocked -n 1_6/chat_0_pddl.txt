           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning about Goal Achievement with Limited Actions**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which I've expanded to require an object of type `v17` be positioned on surface `v18`.  Given the initial state, I've identified `v8` and `v12` as potential candidates for this object, as both are of type `v17`.  Essentially, the plan aims to ensure either `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)` is true.
           
           I meticulously examined the current state, and the definitions of `on` to understand how these objects are currently situated:
           
           *   `v8` is currently supported by `v11` at pose `v9`.
           *   `v12` is currently supported by `v14` at pose `v13`.
           
           My initial analysis reveals I would need to *pick* either `v8` or `v12` from its current location and *place* it on `v18`.  The domain provides specific properties regarding `supported` and `atpose`. `v8` and `v12` *can* be supported by `v18`.
           
           However, the critical constraint is that only a single action instance is allowed: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. The problem explicitly states that any action not in the provided list is prohibited.
           
           After re-evaluating the problem, I noticed that `on` facts are not currently true, so `move_base` cannot achieve them. Since the only available action does not change the facts relevant to satisfying the goal (it does not affect *on* predicates, or *atpose*), the goal remains unachievable within the given constraints.
           
           Therefore, because the allowed action does not change the robot's grasp or the positioning of items, and the desired states for both options require *pick* and *place* actions not permitted, the goal cannot be satisfied.
