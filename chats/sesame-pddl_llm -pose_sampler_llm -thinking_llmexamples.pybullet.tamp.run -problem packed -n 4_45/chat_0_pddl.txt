(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for a Square Object**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 4) on a given surface (0), where stability means the object is fully inside the surface and doesn't collide with other things. The surface is a square of size 0.27m x 0.27m centered at the origin, and the object's dimensions are roughly 0.084m x 0.084m.
           
           The main challenge is that the object's effective bounding box changes when it's rotated. I've worked out that for a square object, the maximum half-dimension of the bounding box is 0.5 * S * sqrt(2) (where S is the side length), which occurs at a 45-degree angle.  The minimum is 0.5 * S, which occurs when the rotation is a multiple of 90 degrees. So, I calculated the bounds for the object center `(x, y)` based on this maximum bounding box. The object's size limits the center to a smaller square inside the original surface.
           
           To get the 50 placements, I'm going to vary both the object's rotation angle (`theta`) and its position `(x, y)`. I'll use 10 different rotation angles, spaced evenly from 0 to 9 * pi/10. For each angle, I will use five `(x,y)` placements:  the center (0, 0), two points on the x-axis, and two points on the y-axis, all at half the valid distance from the center.
           
           The key is that for a square object, the range of possible valid center positions depends on the rotation angle. Using this strategy will ensure that all 50 placements satisfy the condition that the object remains entirely inside the bounding surface.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's my plan for placing the new object (ID 5) in the scene, ensuring it doesn't collide with the existing object (ID 4):
           
           *   **Understand the Constraints:** Object 4 is fixed at (0, 0) and has a known size (AABB). Object 5 is a square with a known size as well. I need to avoid any overlap between their bounding boxes. The placement area is surface 0 with bounds `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           *   **Collision Avoidance is Key:** I'll focus on keeping the AABBs of the objects separate. I've worked out the concept of the 'forbidden zone' around object 4.
           *   **Define the Geometry:** Object 4's half-size is `S4/2 = 0.04207`. Object 5 will have a *h_dim5*, the half-extent of the rotated AABB.
           *   **Calculate Rotation Bounds:** First, I need to limit Object 5's rotations. Its AABB needs to fit completely within the surface boundaries. When *h_dim5* is maximized, the object can't fit on the surface, and thus, I can only use `theta = k * pi/2`.
           *   **Define Valid Ranges:** I've calculated the valid and forbidden *x* and *y* ranges for object 5's center. The *forbidden* ranges in the surface area depend on Object 4's bounding box and the current *h_dim5*. I've verified that the most suitable value for the placement will be, theta= 0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2.
           *   **Coordinate Generation:** I will be using 13 positions for theta = 0. Then another 37 positions for the remaining 3 angles. Those positions will be carefully sampled within the available corner regions of each quadrant to have enough diversity while maintaining the separation. This allows for diverse placements, as I have sufficient freedom along the corner strips.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Alright, the task is clear. I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 6 on surface 0, making sure it doesn't collide with objects 4 and 5. This boils down to figuring out a safe spot within the surface's boundaries, respecting those pesky obstacle rectangles. I'll need to carefully calculate the AABB's and regions of object 6 considering rotation, ensuring that no overlap occurs.
           
           **Understanding the Constraints**
           
           Surface 0 is a rectangle defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. Object 4's a square with an AABB `[-0.042, 0.042]` around (0,0). And object 5 is another square with AABB `[-0.134, -0.042]` in x and y. Object 6 is a new square of size 0.072.
           
           **AABB, Theta and h_dim6**
           
           The key here is understanding `h_dim6`. Given object 6 size and a given rotation `theta`, `h_dim6` is calculated, which represents the half-extents of the rotated AABB. This will change depending on `theta`, thus changing the forbidden area. The minimum `h_dim6` is 0.036 which happens when `theta` is a multiple of `pi/2`.
           
           **Collision Avoidance & Forbidden Regions**
           
           My plan is to find the regions where I *can* place the object, so I'll be more focused on calculating *forbidden* regions (collision zones).
           
           1.  **Object 4:** The center of object 6 must stay outside a square of `2 * (0.042 + h_dim6)` around the origin.
           2.  **Object 5:** Center of object 6 must stay outside a square, again, of `2 * (0.046 + h_dim6)`, and this square is centered at `(-0.088, -0.088)`.
           
           **Simplified Strategy: theta=0**
           
           For initial simplicity, I'll start with `theta = 0`. This way, `h_dim6` is the minimum value (0.036). It can simplify calculations a bit for initial space analysis.
           
           **Calculating Forbidden Regions at theta=0**
           
           I figured out the forbidden regions. Object 4 makes the center of object 6 forbidden region be a square from -0.078 to 0.078 in both x and y. Object 5 produces a forbidden region starting at -0.170 to -0.0067 and -0.170 to -0.0067. After careful consideration, the allowed region for the center is *a tiny top right square from 0.078 to 0.098*. I can't put any more than one object in this configuration with the constraints.
           
           **Region Definition and Grid**
           
           This means I must use a fine grid in the upper-right region of the surface, as the only valid space for the center for a given `theta=0`. So I will generate a 7x7 grid, thus 49 points. I'll add a 50th point.
           
           **Placement Plan**
           
           Use a 7x7 grid plus an additional point centered with `theta=pi/2`, if necessary.
