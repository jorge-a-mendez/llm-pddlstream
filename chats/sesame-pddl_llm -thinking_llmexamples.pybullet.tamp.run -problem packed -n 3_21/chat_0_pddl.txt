(Thoughts: **Initial Analysis and Planning**
           
           Alright, let's break down this problem. My objective is to achieve `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`. Looking at the initial state and the goal, it's pretty clear: I need to get those three objects onto `v16`.  The initial state provides crucial information, like the robot's capabilities (`canmove()`, `arm()`, etc.), the objects' properties (graspable, stackable), their current positions, and supported states.
           
           **Key Observations & Initial Strategy**
           
           The core idea here is to exploit the available *actions*: `pick` and `place`. Since each object is initially at a known pose and the goal requires them to be `on v16` at a new pose, the obvious strategy is to pick each object, move the arm, and then place it onto `v16` at its intended destination pose. It appears the relevant *continuous* target pose, symbolically `#o2`, is the intended final location for all three objects and they will all be supported by `v16` at `#o2` according to the initial problem description.
           Additionally, the continuous planner generates a valid and collision-free target for each object.
           
           **Detailed Plan**
           
           1.  **Move Base:** I'll begin by moving the robot's base from its starting configuration `v3` to a configuration that makes pick and place actions valid (`#o3`). All pick and place actions require the base to be at the same configuration, so this is the simplest common configuration.
           
           2.  **Pick & Place (Repeat for each Object):**
               *   **Pick:** Use the `pick` action to grasp each object (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`) from its current pose.  This requires the arm to be empty (`handempty()`), which it will be initially and after each place operation.
               *   **Place:** Use the `place` action to put each grasped object onto `v16` at `#o2`.
           
           **Verification and Cost Consideration**
           
           By following this sequence (Move Base, Pick, Place, Pick, Place, Pick, Place), I should be able to ensure `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.
           
           A quick check on the available actions shows everything will work as `canmove()` is always true at the start of pick actions and it is restored at the end of place actions.
           
           The estimated cost will include base movement cost and the pick and place costs.  This should be the lowest cost solution as I am only moving the robot's base once for a common pick and place position.
