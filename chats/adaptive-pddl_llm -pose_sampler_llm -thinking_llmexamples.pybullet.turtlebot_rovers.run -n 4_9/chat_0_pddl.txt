           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable: A Deep Dive into the Rovers Domain**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a planning problem in the `rovers` domain, and the target is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. Let's break this down.
           
           First, I need to understand what `new-axiom@0()` represents.  It's a conjunction of several conditions.  I immediately recognize that the initial conditions (`atconf` and `free`) are already satisfied in the initial state. No problem there.
           
           However, the core of the problem lies in the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. I can see that `new-axiom@0()` needs `receivedimage` for four different image locations (v11), plus `receivedanalysis` for some `?stone` and `?soil`.
           
           My initial thought is to check what rocks and soils are defined in the initial state: `v4`, `v3`, `v1`, and `v8`, `v5`, `v7`, respectively.
           
           Then, I look at the actions I can execute: `move`, and `drop_rock`. I immediately see a problem. These actions don't allow me to *get* an image or *analyze* a rock and get a result. `move` is effectively a no-op because the rovers are already in place and `drop_rock` can't be executed because the rovers are `free`, not `full`.
           
           At this point, it's clear: my goal is unreachable with the given actions. I'm missing critical actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`, plus possibly a `calibrate` action.  These are essential to generate the required facts: `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`. The initial state doesn't have these facts and with these actions I can't generate these facts.
           
           Therefore, since `new-axiom@0()` demands that *all* its components are true, and since the initial state doesn't contain the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` conditions, and because I can't generate them with the available actions, I have to conclude that this goal is not achievable in this scenario.
