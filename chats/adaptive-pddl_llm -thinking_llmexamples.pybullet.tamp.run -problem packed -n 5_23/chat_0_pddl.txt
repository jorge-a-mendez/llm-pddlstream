(Thoughts: **Reasoning Through the Plan**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a planning problem in a PDDL domain. My objective is to get a set of objects (`v8, v12, v14, v16, v18`) positioned `on` another object (`v20`).  Based on the problem definition, I know that to achieve the `on` predicate, I need to find appropriate poses for each object that are both *supported* by `v20` and *at* those poses. This boils down to figuring out a plan that strategically places each of these objects.
           
           I've carefully examined the initial state and the provided facts. I quickly noted that the target objects start off supported by object `v11` (e.g., `on(v8, v11)` is initially true). Now, there are various poses associated with `v8, v12, v14, v16, v18` - poses like `v9, v13, v15, v17, v19` in the initial state.  What is also interesting is that there are *supported* facts related to object `v20`. For example, I observe that `supported(v8, #o2, v20)`, meaning if I put `v8` at pose `#o2` it will be supported by `v20`.
           
           This means my plan *must* involve moving each object from its initial state *to* the appropriate pose on `v20`.  
           
           The heart of the plan, however, seems to hinge on what actions are available. The action list given *exclusively* contains  `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. That's it!  I have no *pick* or *place* action instances. This seems critical.
           
           Reviewing the actions:
           `move_base v3 v3 #o0` simply moves the base from location `v3` to location `v3` using trajectory `#o0`.  This has no effect on my `on` goal condition.  Further, this action *negates* `canmove()`.
           
           The `pick` and `place` actions would be the obvious way to manipulate objects by changing their `atpose`. But these are *explicitly not* in the action list.  `canmove()` being false further reinforces the need for `pick`/`place`, since these actions both *assert* `canmove()` in their effects.
           
           In short: I am confined to only using `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. Since the only way to satisfy `on(?o, v20)` is to *place* the objects at the new pose, and since the `pick` and `place` actions are *not* available to be used, I conclude the given goal is **not achievable** because I cannot alter the initial states using the specified action set.
