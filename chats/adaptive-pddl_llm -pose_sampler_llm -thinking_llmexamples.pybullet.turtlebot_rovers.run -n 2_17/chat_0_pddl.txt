User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Understanding the Task: Finding Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, so I need to come up with 25 different (x, y) coordinates for a robot's base. These positions have some specific rules: they all have to be within a certain distance (4 units) from a given target point. They also have to stay within the boundaries of the environment, which is a square area defined by x and y coordinates between -2.5 and 2.5.  Crucially, the robot base positions *can't* collide with any of the fixed obstacles already placed within this space.  These obstacles are described by their minimum and maximum x and y coordinates (essentially, they're rectangular blocks).
           
           My main goals are to generate valid positions based on the above, ensuring:
           * Within bounds
           * within range
           * no collisions
           * diversity
           
           Here's how I'm thinking I'll approach it:
           
           1.  **Analyze the Scene:** First, I need to understand the layout of the environment. I'll read the provided list of obstacle AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) to get a clear picture of where the fixed obstacles are located. I'll pay close attention to the central, vertical wall at x=0, as it's a critical factor for line-of-sight to the target.
           
           2.  **Constraint Enforcement:**
               *   **Environment Limits:** I *must* ensure that every (x, y) coordinate I propose falls within the defined square space of [-2.5, 2.5] for both x and y.
               *   **Distance Restriction:** The base positions have to be no more than 4 units away from the designated target point.
               *   **Collision Detection:** Crucially, I'll need a precise way to check if a proposed (x, y) coordinate falls within any of the obstacle AABBs. This is *the* biggest constraint.
           
           3.  **Position Generation Strategy:**
               *   **Target-Centric Generation:** The core idea is to generate potential positions around the target point using a combination of spirals and grids. The spiral generation is preferred as it spreads points around. The grid is helpful to get all valid points.
               *   **Spiral Outward:** I'll start with points closer to the target and spiral outward.
               *   **Grid Points:** I'll also add a grid of points to ensure full area coverage.
               *   **Collision Filtering:** Every proposed point generated will be immediately checked for collisions *before* it's considered a valid candidate.
               *   **Central Wall Handling:** The central vertical wall is handled to ensure that a position is preferred on the same side as the target point, when possible. Otherwise, it is a hard line-of-sight filter.
               *   **Uniqueness:**  I'll round the generated (x, y) coordinates to a few decimal places to ensure that I'm only selecting unique, non-overlapping positions.
               *   **Iterative Relaxation:** If, despite this, I cannot find 25 unique positions (the environment may be too constrained), the rules will be relaxed step by step, removing the preference for staying on the same side of the target.
               *   **Padding if Necessary:** I'll ensure I *always* return 25 positions. If needed, I will duplicate or create artificial positions.
           
           I'm confident in generating a valid and diverse set of 25 positions.
