           I need to reconsider my strategy. The target point is at y=1.91, which is quite high. I need to avoid the obstacles near y=1.75 to y=2.25 in the regions (-2.25, -1.75), (-0.75, -0.25), (0.25, 0.75), (1.75, 2.25). Also, there are small obstacles at (-1.07, 2.0), (-0.42, 1.87), (-2.09, 1.76), (1.86, 1.76), (0.64, 1.96). Given the target's y coordinate, staying at the same y might lead to collisions with these. I should try to move the x coordinate to a safe zone.

           Reviewing previous failures:
           - Positions near the top wall (y=2.45) failed.
           - Positions near x=1.9, y=1.8 (like (1.91, 1.84)) failed due to obstacles ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) and ((1.86, 1.76), (1.94, 1.84)). This is very close to the current target point, so I need to be careful.
           - Positions like (-0.38, 0.0) and (-1.5, 1.0) failed due to no line of sight. This suggests the vertical obstacle at x=0, or other obstacles, are blocking the view from positions with negative x values to the target point which is in positive x.
           - Position (-2.0, 1.91) collided with obstacles near x=-2 and y=1.9.
           
           Given the new target point (1.9044034481048584, 1.805999755859375), which is very close to the obstacle at ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)), I need to find positions that are not within this obstacle but are still within range. The x=0 obstacle means I should likely stay on the positive x side.

           Reviewing previous failures:
           - Many positions failed due to 'no line of sight to target', especially when crossing the x=0 vertical obstacle. This confirms the significant obstruction at x=0.
           - Collisions with obstacles near the target point are common. The target is at (-2.04, 1.81), very close to obstacles like ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)) and ((-2.09, 1.76), (-1.99, 1.86)).
           
           Given the new target point (-2.0452799797058105, 1.817358136177063), I need to find positions that are within 2 units of this point and avoid the obstacles. I should focus on the negative x-half of the environment. I need to be careful with the obstacles around the target point itself.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = +/- 2.5 and y = +/- 2.5. There's a vertical obstacle at x=0. There are also several smaller rectangular obstacles scattered around. I will try to find positions within the allowed range and within a 2-unit radius of the target point while avoiding the known obstacles.
           
           The target point is (-2.0452799797058105, 1.817358136177063).
           Reviewing previous failures for this target:
           - (-1.0452799797058105, 1.817358136177063) was "not reachable for robot base". This suggests that even though it's within 2 units, it might be too close to x=0 obstacle or other obstacles that make it an invalid base position.
           - Previous attempts to view this target from positive x coordinates failed due to the x=0 obstacle.
           
           Given the target at (-2.04, 1.81), I need to find positions in the negative x-half. I must avoid the obstacles at ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)) and ((-2.09, 1.76), (-1.99, 1.86)). This means I cannot place the robot directly on the target's x-coordinate, or very close to it, if its y coordinate is around 1.8. I need to move further away from these small obstacles.
           
           Positions:
           (-2.4 1.817358136177063)
           (-2.0452799797058105 2.4)
           (-2.0 0.5)
