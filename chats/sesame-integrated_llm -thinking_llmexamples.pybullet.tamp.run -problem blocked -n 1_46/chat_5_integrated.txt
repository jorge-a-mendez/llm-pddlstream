           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((3.283, -0.25), (4.83, 0.678)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.454, 0.078), (-4.356, 0.176)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.405, 0.127, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.949, 0.317).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My objective is to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object `?green` that is both "on" another object (`v18`) and of a specific "type" (`v17`). Initially, I know an object `v12` is of type `v17`. Therefore, my primary goal is to make `v12` be "on" `v18`.
           
           To achieve this, I need to place `v12` on `v18`. This requires finding a pose for `v12` (let's call it `#p1`) such that it's supported by `v18` and then actually move `v12` to that pose.
           
           Examining the current situation, `v12` is initially supported by `v14` at pose `v13`. I also know `v12` can be placed on `v18` at `#p1`. My plan will be to move `v12` from its current pose `v13` (on `v14`) to the target pose `#p1` (on `v18`).
           
           I've identified these necessary steps:
           
           1.  **Move the base to a suitable position:**  Before picking `v12` at `v13`, I need to position the base to be able to place `v12` on `v18` at `#p1`. This means moving the base from configuration `v3` to a new configuration `#q2`.
           2.  **Pick up `v12`:** Using arm `v4`, I'll execute the `pick` action to grasp `v12` from pose `v13`.
           3.  **Move the base again:** After picking up the object, I must move the base to configuration `#q3` so that the arm can place the object to the specified pose.
           4.  **Place `v12` on `v18` at #p1:** Finally, I'll use arm `v4` and the `place` action to set `v12` at pose `#p1` on `v18`.
           
           **Action Details and Preconditions**
           
           *   **Move Base (v3 to #q2)**: This action positions the robot for the pick step. The precondition to execute this `move_base` action is to be currently at base configuration `v3` and have the ability to move. The outcome will be that the base is now at `#q2`.
           *   **Pick:** The preconditions for the `pick` action include being in base configuration `#q2`, knowing the object's initial pose `v13`, the hand (arm) is empty. The pick step will result in the base being no longer able to move (as it is grasping `v12`), and the arm `v4` now holding the object `v12` (at grasp `#g1`).
           *   **Move Base (#q2 to #q3):** Before placing the object the robot base must move to a new base configuration `#q3`. The preconditions will be being able to move and being at the base configuration `#q2`. The outcome will be the base being at configuration `#q3` and no longer being able to move.
           *   **Place:** The preconditions for this `place` action are being at base configuration `#q3`, holding the object at grasp `#g1`, and that the target pose `#p1` is within reach.  The execution of this action places the object `v12` at the target pose `#p1` and frees the arm `v4`.
           
           **Pose Estimation**
           
           To ensure the "on" condition is met, I need to provide a continuous value for the pose `#p1`. I'll place `v12` directly on `v18`. Given `v18`'s dimensions, I have calculated a suitable position and assign the value of (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0) to `#p1`, which accounts for the object's positioning, alignment, and the required z-height to be supported by v18.
           
           **Goal Achieved**
           
           By carrying out the above actions in the correct sequence, I am certain that the final state will fulfill the requirement to have `v12` on `v18` and of the type `v17`. My goal `new-axiom@0()` will therefore be satisfied. The plan provides the robot the capability to arrange the objects to achieve the target.
