           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.19, 0.521)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.454, 0.078), (-4.356, 0.176)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.405, 0.127, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.949, 0.317).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()` Goal**
           
           My primary objective is to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of type `v17` placed on surface `v18`. Since I can choose between `v8` or `v12` as the object of type `v17`, I must choose one to place on `v18`. From the initial conditions, it seems `v8` is in a more favorable position (closer to `v18`) than `v12`. I'll focus on `v8` first. The core plan requires `on(v8, v18)`. From the axiom definitions, that implies placing `v8` on `v18`, which consists of two preconditions:  `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `atpose(v8, #o2)`. Since `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is initially true, I only need to make `atpose(v8, #o2)` true.
           
           To do this, I will implement a pick-and-place strategy using the robot arm. To achieve the proper `atpose` of `v8` on surface `v18` at location `#o2`, I need to use these actions:
           1.  `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`: Picking up `v8` from its current pose `v9`.
           2.  `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`: Placing `v8` onto pose `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           I must ensure the preconditions for these actions are satisfied. `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`, `atpose(v8, v9)`, and `handempty(v4)` are true initially. So I need only one extra component. I must make sure that `atbconf(#o3)` is true to enable the movement of the base.
           
           The most important of these for my problem is that if `#o3` is a specific configuration the robot *must* move to, I have to ensure the base is in the right configuration before picking and placing. If `#o3` is different from the initial configuration `v3`, I must add a step: `move_base(v3, #o3, #o0)`. The most general solution is to include a move and assume that the `kin` actions must be true. With no information about the distance, I must assume `distance(v3, #o3)` is a cost that makes the `move_base` action necessary.
           
           To do the place, I must make sure there are no unsafe actions. The parameters are:
           *   `#o1`: A grasp for `v8`.
           *   `#o2`: A stable and collision-free pose to place `v8` on surface `v18`. From what I see the parameters are (4.5, -0.3, 0.8) and (0,0,0,1) for the quaternion.
           *   `#o3`: Base configuration. Since no coordinate information has been provided, I assume that `#o3` represents the base config *reachable by the arm* to do the pick and place.
           *   `#o4`: The trajectory of the action.
           
           My optimized Plan:
           1.  `move_base(v3, #o3, #o0)` (if `v3 != #o3`): This will ensure the base configuration necessary for the `kin` predicates to make the remaining actions possible.
           2.  `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`: Pick up `v8` from pose `v9` with grasp `#o1`.
           3.  `place(v4, v8, (4.5, -0.3, 0.8), #o1, #o3, #o4)`: Place `v8` on surface `v18` at pose `#o2`. The base config is `#o3`.
           
           If `v3` and `#o3` were the same, there would be no move cost and the total action cost would be 2. If they are different, the total action cost would be 2 + cost of `move_base`.
           
           This comprehensive plan accomplishes the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which requires placing an object of type `v17` (in this case `v8`) onto surface `v18`.
