           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:

           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((3.283, -0.25), (4.83, 0.678)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.454, 0.078), (-4.356, 0.176)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.405, 0.127, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.949, 0.317).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Reasoning through the Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which breaks down to ensuring object `v12` is *on* object `v18`.  Given the initial state, I know that `v12` is currently *on* `v14` and that `type(v12, v17)` is true, so finding `v12` will be simple.  To achieve the goal, I must make `atpose(v12, #o2)` true and ensure that the placement is physically possible by meeting the `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` predicate. This goal requires picking `v12` from its current pose (`v13`) and placing it at a suitable pose which must be `#o2` on surface `v18` in order to satisfy the requirements of the goal.
           
           The initial state reveals a supporting structure, `#o2`, is necessary for meeting the goals of the plan.  I need to pick the object from the surface it is currently supported by, as shown in the facts, and then place it at a new pose and configuration.
           
           I can identify the actions needed to implement the plan by going through the existing facts: I must use `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`, `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)`, and `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`.
           
           The plan to achieve the goal is:
           
           1.  **Move the base:** `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`. This ensures that the robot base can manipulate `v12` to meet the objective.
           
           2.  **Pick the object:** `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. This will remove `v12` from its current pose.
           
           3.  **Place the object:** `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. This should put the object into the right state by placing the object at pose `#o2`.
           
           The critical step for success relies on `#o2`, which the plan is trying to achieve. The goal is `on(v12, v18)`, which, from the facts provided, means I must make `atpose(v12, #o2)` true and fulfill `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`.
           We have `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` in the initial state so all that is necessary is that the object meets the conditions of `atpose(v12, #o2)`.
           
           To determine the values needed for `#o2` such that the object is on the new surface correctly, I need to know the x, y, and z values for `#o2` at the object's origin. The supporting surface AABB for `v18` is `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`, with `v12`'s AABB `((-4.454, 0.078), (-4.356, 0.176))`.  `#o2` must, therefore, exist within this AABB for object placement to succeed. `0.801` is its current z value at pose `v13`, so I assume it's table height, plus the object's height.
           
           `v15` is another object which can exist on a surface at a nearby AABB and at the same table level: To ensure the object's placement is in the correct configuration, I must consider where `v12` needs to be placed on a surface in the existing plan.
           A feasible value for `#o2` would be the surface's center point plus a z value such that placement is at table level. I determine that point to be the surface midpoint, (4.5,-0.3). Using 0.8 as a standard table height, I will use `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)` for `#o2`, the placement pose for v12. In the given plan, placement for this target surface ensures a safe state.
           
           Putting the final values together, the relevant configuration is `(#o2 v12 v18): (4.5 -0.3 0.8 0.0)`.
           
           This plan satisfies the stated goal.
