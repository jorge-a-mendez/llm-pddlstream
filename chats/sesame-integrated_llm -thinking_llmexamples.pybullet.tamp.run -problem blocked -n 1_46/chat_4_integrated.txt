           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((3.283, -0.25), (4.83, 0.678)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.454, 0.078), (-4.356, 0.176)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.405, 0.127, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.949, 0.317).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Axiom Satisfaction**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan: my primary objective is to make `new-axiom@0()` true. This boils down to ensuring `on(v12, v18)` and `type(v12, v17)` are both true.  I can see that 'v12' is the object I need to focus on. Since 'type(v12, v17)' is already true in the initial state, I just need to get `v12` onto `v18`.
           
           Right now, 'v12' is positioned at a pose that is on `v14`. I know from the axioms that to achieve 'on(v12, v18)' I need to achieve both `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)`.  Fortunately, `supported(v12, #p1, v18)` is true in the initial state. This means all I need to do is get `atpose(v12, #p1)` to be true.
           
           To do this, I must first pick up `v12` from its current pose, and then place it at `#p1`. I already see the actions I can use for this: `pick` and `place`. The preconditions for 'pick' are: `kin` (which means the robot can reach it with that base and arm), `atpose`, `handempty`, `atbconf`, and safety checks. Similarly, `place` has the corresponding preconditions for the 'place' action.
           
           Before 'pick', the robot needs to move its base config from `v3` to a base config `#q2`.  I can see a valid motion plan available to move there. The same thing will be necessary to execute the `place` action. I will need to move to base config `#q3`. I've already confirmed I have available motion plans to move from the initial base configuration `v3` through the required intermediate configuration `#q2`, and finally to `#q3`.
           
           The core of the plan will look like this:
           1.  **Move the robot base** from `v3` to `#q2`.
           2.  **Pick up** the object `v12` from its current pose.
           3.  **Move the robot base** from `#q2` to `#q3`.
           4.  **Place** the object `v12` at pose `#p1`.
           
           All of the safety-related predicates like collision checks and such are assumed to be safe because no negative atoms were given in the initial state. Because a pose is involved, I do need to specify a continuous value for `#p1` so that the object is placed correctly on the table and not in an unsafe position. Based on the position and size of the table, as well as the object, I can reasonably set the pose of `#p1` to (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0), which is in the middle of table v18 and at standard table height. All looks good here. The plan is sound.
