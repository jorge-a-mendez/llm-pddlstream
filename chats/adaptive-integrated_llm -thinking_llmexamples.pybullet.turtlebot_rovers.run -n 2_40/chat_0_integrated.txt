           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unreachable Due to Limited Rover Mobility**
           
           Okay, so the task is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to getting images and analyses of specific rocks and sending them back to the lander.  My initial thinking process is to break this down into smaller, achievable steps. I see that I need to:
           
           1.  **Obtain Images:**  I'll need to calibrate the camera, take pictures of specific objectives, and then send those images to the lander.
           2.  **Analyze Rocks:**  I'll need to sample rock and soil samples, analyze them, and send the results back to the lander.
           
           My plan looked straightforward on paper, but after digging in, I've hit a major roadblock.  The problem lies in the restricted set of allowed *move* actions. It's only possible to move the rovers from their current position *back* to their current position, a no-op that restricts their ability to actually *do* anything.
           
           **The Key Constraint: Limited Mobility**
           
           The issue boils down to the fact that the available `move` actions prevent the rovers from reaching the necessary configurations for imaging, sampling, and communication. To send images, I need to be in a configuration (`#o0`) visible to the lander. To take images, I'd need to be in another configuration (`#o3`) that allows the camera to see the objectives. To sample rocks, I need to be in configuration `#o5` which is located above the rocks.  But, the only way I can get there *and* the only actions allowed in the plan are those that simply move the rovers to the very same location that they currently occupy.
           
           Because the allowable `move` action instances do *not* include any movement between valid configurations, I am unable to satisfy the preconditions for actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. Without those actions, I can't achieve the final goal.
           
           **Revisiting the Problem Statement**
           
           I went back and re-read the problem statement very carefully. I'm sure I'm missing something, maybe there is some hidden continuous value. No. The statement explicitly says, "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           **Conclusion: The Plan is Impossible**
           
           Therefore, I have to conclude that given the stated constraints and the available actions, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is *unachievable*.  I cannot devise a valid plan because the rovers' mobility is severely restricted, preventing them from accessing the necessary configurations for successful completion of the required image and analysis tasks.
