           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Goal Unreachability**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with the goal of achieving `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain. It's a conjunction of several conditions, with two primary aspects: obtaining images of specific objectives and analyzing certain rock samples. My initial reaction is to break this down, understand the preconditions, and see if I can devise a sequence of actions.
           
           The first set of conditions revolves around `receivedimage`. To get these, I'd need to execute `send_image`.  To trigger `send_image`, I first need to ensure the appropriate `haveimage` condition. To get `haveimage`, I'd have to execute `take_image`, which, in turn, needs `calibrated`. So, the path is clear: `calibrate` -> `take_image` -> `send_image`. It's a straightforward sequence. The analysis quickly reveals a critical issue: the rovers, `v12` and `v14`, are stuck in their initial configurations, `v13` and `v15` respectively. The `take_image` action (and subsequently `calibrate`) have an important precondition, namely `atconf(?v, ?q)`. The problem is that the `q` config I need for `imagevisible` predicates is not equal to the initial `atconf` configuration. It is actually `#o3`. To get the rovers into that configuration, I'd need a `move` action. Unfortunately, the available `move` actions are useless: they keep the rovers in the same configuration. This means I'm stuck.
           
           The same problem emerges with the second part of the goal. To satisfy `receivedanalysis`, I need `send_analysis`. To get this, I need `sample_rock`. The precondition is the critical `atconf(?v, ?q)` predicate. But the actions like `sample_rock` require the rovers to be at `#o5`, but they are at the wrong configurations.
           
           Therefore, since the rovers are fixed and cannot move to the needed configurations due to the missing or unhelpful move actions, I cannot achieve either the image-sending or the rock-sampling parts of the goal. The `new-axiom@0()` is currently unreachable.
