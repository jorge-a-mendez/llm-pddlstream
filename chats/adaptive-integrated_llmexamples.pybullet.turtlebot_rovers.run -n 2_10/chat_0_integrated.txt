           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.64, -1.264), (-0.501, -1.126)).
           Object v1 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.08, 0.691), (-0.986, 0.786)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.981, 1.994), (-1.895, 2.08)).
           Object v7 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.06, -0.131), (-0.956, -0.027)).

           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.821, -1.929), (1.187, -1.571)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.822, -0.645), (-1.682, -0.506)).
           Object v3 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-2.216, 1.084), (-2.132, 1.167)).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.349, 1.999), (0.444, 2.094)).
           Object v9 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
           Object v15 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, both equipped with camera `v10` which supports mode `v11`. Both rovers have a storage unit `v16`. There are several rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`) and objectives (`v17`, `v18`). There's also a lander `v9`.
           
           The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which expands to:
           ```
             Conjunction
               Atom atconf(v12, v13)
               Atom atconf(v14, v15)
               Atom free(v12, v16)
               Atom free(v14, v16)
               Atom receivedimage(v17, v11)
               Atom receivedimage(v18, v11)
               Atom type(?stone, v2)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?stone)
               Atom type(?soil, v6)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?soil)
           ```
           Let's break down the goal and check the initial state:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: True in initial state.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: True in initial state.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: True in initial state.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: True in initial state.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: False in initial state.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: False in initial state.
           7. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: We need to find a rock of type `v2` and analyze it. Rocks `v1`, `v3`, `v4` are of type `v2`. None are analyzed or received analysis in the initial state.
           8. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: We need to find a rock of type `v6` and analyze it. Rocks `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are of type `v6`. None are analyzed or received analysis in the initial state.
           
           The available actions are `move`, `drop_rock`.
           The `move` actions `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)` will keep the rovers at their current configurations. This means we cannot use other configurations to take images, sample rocks, or send analyses, unless the current configuration itself can be used for these actions.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, a rover needs to `take_image` and then `send_image`.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for a `v2` rock and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for a `v6` rock, a rover needs to `sample_rock` and then `send_analysis`.
           
           Looking at the initial state and the available actions:
           - There are no `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` actions available. This means the problem cannot be solved using the given actions and initial state, as the goal requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates to be true, which can only be achieved by `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, respectively. These actions are not in the list of available action instances.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the provided list of valid action instances.
           
           It seems I misunderstood the problem statement about "available action instances". It only lists `move` and `drop_rock`.
           If I am restricted to *only* these actions, then the goal is indeed impossible to achieve, as `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` cannot be made true.
           
           However, the problem statement says: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           This means that I can only use the listed instances of `move` and `drop_rock`. This strictly limits the actions.
           
           If this is the case, and I cannot infer new action instances or use the general action definitions, then the problem is indeed unsolvable.
           
           Let's re-evaluate. The problem statement says: "You will then generate a list of actions that achieve the goal. It is critical that the preconditions of each action are satisfied after the previous action is executed, and that actions are collision-free. You are only allowed to use the provided actions. It's essential to stick to the format of these basic actions. When creating a plan, replace the arguments of each action with specific objects. You can first describe the provided scene and what it indicates about the provided task objects to help you come up with a plan."
           
           And then: "Here is a list of valid action instances (applications of actions to specific objects). Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           This is a very strict interpretation. If only these 4 actions are allowed, then the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates in the goal cannot be satisfied because the `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions are not in the list of allowed instances.
           
           Based on the strict interpretation of "list of valid action instances," the goal is unachievable.
           
           Let me confirm that I have not missed anything.
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires:
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for a type `v2` rock
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for a type `v6` rock
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`, the action `send_image` must be executed.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis`, the action `send_analysis` must be executed.
           
           Neither `send_image` nor `send_analysis` appear in the list of "valid action instances":
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           Therefore, it is impossible to satisfy the goal.
