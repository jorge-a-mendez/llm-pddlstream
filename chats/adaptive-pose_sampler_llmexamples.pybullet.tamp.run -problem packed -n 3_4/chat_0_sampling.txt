           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 6) -- 0.09257012528619962, 0.09257012528619965)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27. The object is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0926 x 0.0926. This means the object is significantly smaller than the surface and should be relatively easy to place.
           
           I will try to place the object on surface 0. Since the object is square, its orientation (rotation angle) does not affect its AABB. Therefore, I will primarily consider 0-degree rotations. I will aim for diverse placements, covering different areas of the surface. I will ensure the object's AABB is fully contained within the surface's AABB.
           
           For surface 0, with `lower_x = -0.135`, `lower_y = -0.135`, `upper_x = 0.135`, `upper_y = 0.135`, and the object having `size_x = 0.09257012528619962` and `size_y = 0.09257012528619965`, the half-extents of the object are `half_size_x = 0.04628506264309981` and `half_size_y = 0.046285062643099825`.
           
           The valid range for the object's center `x` is `(-0.135 + 0.04628506264309981)` to `(0.135 - 0.04628506264309981)`, which is `(-0.08871493735690019, 0.08871493735690019)`.
           The valid range for the object's center `y` is `(-0.135 + 0.046285062643099825)` to `(0.135 - 0.046285062643099825)`, which is `(-0.08871493735690017, 0.08871493735690017)`.
           
           I will select 50 points within these ranges, attempting to distribute them somewhat evenly or in a grid-like fashion, and also trying a few rotated placements (though for a square object, it won't change the bounding box for stability checks, but it might be considered a different valid pose).

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have successfully placed object 6 at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. This means object 6 is now occupying the center of surface 0.
           
           Now, I need to place a new object, object 5, which is also square with `size_x = 0.09352055437827811` and `size_y = 0.093520554378278`. The half-extents for object 5 are `half_size_x = 0.046760277189139055` and `half_size_y = 0.046760277189139`.
           
           The valid placement area for object 5 on surface 0, ignoring object 6 for a moment, is:
           `x` range: `(-0.135 + 0.046760277189139055)` to `(0.135 - 0.046760277189139055)`, which is `(-0.08823972281086094, 0.08823972281086094)`.
           `y` range: `(-0.135 + 0.046760277189139)` to `(0.135 - 0.046760277189139)`, which is `(-0.088239722810861, 0.088239722810861)`.
           
           Object 6 (ID: 6) has `size_x = 0.09257012528619962`, `size_y = 0.09257012528619965` and is placed at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`.
           Its AABB is approximately `x: [-0.046285, 0.046285]`, `y: [-0.046285, 0.046285]`.
           
           To avoid collision with object 6, object 5's AABB must not overlap with object 6's AABB. Since object 6 is centered at (0,0), this means object 5 cannot be centered at (0,0) or too close to it.
           
           The sum of half-widths for x is `0.04628506264309981 + 0.046760277189139055 = 0.09304533983223886`.
           The sum of half-heights for y is `0.046285062643099825 + 0.046760277189139 = 0.09304533983223882`.
           
           So, the absolute value of the x-coordinate of object 5's center must be greater than or equal to `0.09304533983223886` to avoid collision along the x-axis if centered on the y-axis, and similarly for the y-coordinate. However, this only applies if they are placed perfectly aligned. A simpler way is to consider that the combined extents of both objects must fit within the surface.
           
           I need to place object 5 such that its AABB `(center_x +/- half_size_x, center_y +/- half_size_y)` does not overlap with object 6's AABB `(-0.046285, 0.046285) x (-0.046285, 0.046285)`.
           
           This leaves significant space around object 6. For example, placing object 5 in the corners or along the edges of the surface, avoiding the central region, should work. I will try to place object 5 far from the center, such as near the corners, which are still within the valid ranges.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have two objects already placed on surface 0:
           - Object 6 (ID: 6): `size_x = 0.09257012528619962`, `size_y = 0.09257012528619965` at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. Its AABB is approximately `x: [-0.046285, 0.046285]`, `y: [-0.046285, 0.046285]`.
           - Object 5 (ID: 5): `size_x = 0.09352055437827811`, `size_y = 0.093520554378278` at `(0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.08)`. Its AABB is approximately `center_x = 0.08`, `center_y = 0.08`, `half_size_x = 0.04676`, `half_size_y = 0.04676`. So its AABB is `x: [0.08 - 0.04676, 0.08 + 0.04676] = [0.03324, 0.12676]`, `y: [0.08 - 0.04676, 0.08 + 0.04676] = [0.03324, 0.12676]`.
           
           Now I need to place object 4 (ID: 4) which is `size_x = 0.09402716053174948`, `size_y = 0.09402716053174942`.
           Its half-extents are `half_size_x = 0.04701358026587474`, `half_size_y = 0.04701358026587471`.
           
           The surface 0 bounds are `x: [-0.135, 0.135]`, `y: [-0.135, 0.135]`.
           The valid placement range for object 4 (ignoring collisions for a moment) on surface 0 is:
           `x` range: `(-0.135 + 0.04701358026587474)` to `(0.135 - 0.04701358026587474)`, which is `(-0.08798641973412526, 0.08798641973412526)`.
           `y` range: `(-0.135 + 0.04701358026587471)` to `(0.135 - 0.04701358026587471)`, which is `(-0.08798641973412529, 0.08798641973412529)`.
           
           I need to find placements for object 4 that avoid colliding with both object 6 and object 5.
           Object 6 AABB: `x: [-0.046285, 0.046285]`, `y: [-0.046285, 0.046285]`
           Object 5 AABB: `x: [0.03324, 0.12676]`, `y: [0.03324, 0.12676]`
           
           Let's try placing object 4 in other corners or along the remaining open edges. For example, the `(-0.08, 0.08)` corner or the `(0.08, -0.08)` corner.
           
           Consider the `(-0.08, 0.08)` corner.
           If object 4 is placed at `(-0.08, 0.08)`:
           Object 4 AABB: `x: [-0.08 - 0.04701, -0.08 + 0.04701] = [-0.12701, -0.03299]`
           `y: [0.08 - 0.04701, 0.08 + 0.04701] = [0.03299, 0.12701]`
           
           - Collision with object 6:
             `x` overlap: `[-0.12701, -0.03299]` and `[-0.046285, 0.046285]`. No overlap as `-0.03299 < -0.046285` is false, but they are close. More precisely, `-0.03299` is to the right of `-0.046285`, but the rightmost point of object 4 is `-0.03299`, and the leftmost of object 6 is `-0.046285`. There is no overlap since `-0.03299 > -0.046285` but object 4's interval is entirely to the left of object 6's. So no x-overlap.
             `y` overlap: `[0.03299, 0.12701]` and `[-0.046285, 0.046285]`. No overlap since `0.03299 > 0.046285` is false, but the interval `[0.03299, 0.12701]` is entirely above the interval `[-0.046285, 0.046285]`. So no y-overlap.
           Thus, placing at `(-0.08, 0.08)` seems safe from object 6.
           
           - Collision with object 5:
             `x` overlap: `[-0.12701, -0.03299]` and `[0.03324, 0.12676]`. No overlap.
             `y` overlap: `[0.03299, 0.12701]` and `[0.03324, 0.12676]`. There is significant overlap here. This placement would collide.
           
           This means the space is getting tight. I need to be more careful with calculations.
           
           Let's try to place it at `(-0.08, -0.08)`.
           If object 4 is placed at `(-0.08, -0.08)`:
           Object 4 AABB: `x: [-0.12701, -0.03299]`
           `y: [-0.12701, -0.03299]`
           
           - Collision with object 6:
             `x` overlap: `[-0.12701, -0.03299]` and `[-0.046285, 0.046285]`. No overlap as `-0.03299` is to the left of `min(0.046285, -0.046285)`. Specifically, `-0.03299` (right edge of obj4) is to the left of `0.046285` (right edge of obj6), and `-0.046285` (left edge of obj6) is to the right of `-0.12701` (left edge of obj4). The intervals are `[-0.127, -0.033]` and `[-0.046, 0.046]`. There is an overlap in x, since `max(-0.127, -0.046) = -0.046` and `min(-0.033, 0.046) = -0.033`, so overlap `[-0.046, -0.033]`. This means they will collide.
           
           My previous reasoning for object 6 collision was incorrect. Object 6's AABB is `x_range_6 = [-0.046285, 0.046285]`.
           If object 4 is at `x = -0.08`, its `x_range_4 = [-0.08 - 0.04701, -0.08 + 0.04701] = [-0.12701, -0.03299]`.
           These two ranges *do* overlap. The overlap is `[max(-0.12701, -0.046285), min(-0.03299, 0.046285)] = [-0.046285, -0.03299]`. So placing at `(-0.08, -0.08)` will collide with object 6.
           
           Okay, I need to properly calculate non-overlapping conditions.
           For two AABBs `[x1_min, x1_max]` and `[x2_min, x2_max]` to NOT overlap, one of these must be true:
           `x1_max <= x2_min` OR `x2_max <= x1_min`.
           
           Object 6 AABB: `X6 = [-0.046285, 0.046285]`, `Y6 = [-0.046285, 0.046285]`
           Object 5 AABB: `X5 = [0.03324, 0.12676]`, `Y5 = [0.03324, 0.12676]`
           Object 4 half-extents: `hX4 = 0.04701358`, `hY4 = 0.04701358`
           
           Let's try to place object 4 at `(0.0, -0.08)`
           Center `(0.0, -0.08)`.
           X4: `[0.0 - hX4, 0.0 + hX4] = [-0.04701, 0.04701]`
           Y4: `[-0.08 - hY4, -0.08 + hY4] = [-0.12701, -0.03299]`
           
           Check against Object 6:
           X-overlap: `[-0.04701, 0.04701]` and `[-0.046285, 0.046285]`. They overlap. Collision.
           
           This means I need to move object 4 further away from the center (0,0) and also away from (0.08, 0.08).
           The non-overlap condition for x-coordinates for object 4 (center `cx4`, half-extent `hX4`) and object 6 (center `cx6=0`, half-extent `hX6=0.046285`) is `abs(cx4 - cx6) >= (hX4 + hX6)`.
           `abs(cx4) >= (0.04701 + 0.046285) = 0.093295`.
           Similarly for y: `abs(cy4) >= (0.04701 + 0.046285) = 0.093295`.
           
           The non-overlap condition for x-coordinates for object 4 and object 5 (center `cx5=0.08`, half-extent `hX5=0.04676`) is `abs(cx4 - cx5) >= (hX4 + hX5)`.
           `abs(cx4 - 0.08) >= (0.04701 + 0.04676) = 0.09377`.
           Similarly for y: `abs(cy4 - 0.08) >= (0.04701 + 0.04676) = 0.09377`.
           
           Let's try to place object 4 at `(-0.088, -0.088)`. This is close to the max allowed coordinate `(-0.08798, -0.08798)`.
           Center `(-0.088, -0.088)`.
           `x_range_4 = [-0.088 - 0.04701, -0.088 + 0.04701] = [-0.13501, -0.04099]`.
           `y_range_4 = [-0.088 - 0.04701, -0.088 + 0.04701] = [-0.13501, -0.04099]`.
           
           Surface containment check: `[-0.13501, -0.04099]` is slightly outside `[-0.135, 0.135]` because `-0.13501 < -0.135`. So `(-0.088, -0.088)` is not valid. I must use coordinates within `(-0.087986, 0.087986)`.
           
           Let's try `(-0.087, -0.087)`.
           Center `(-0.087, -0.087)`.
           `x_range_4 = [-0.087 - 0.04701, -0.087 + 0.04701] = [-0.13401, -0.03999]`.
           `y_range_4 = [-0.087 - 0.04701, -0.087 + 0.04701] = [-0.13401, -0.03999]`.
           This is contained within `[-0.135, 0.135]`.
           
           Check against object 6 (center `(0,0)`, AABB `X6: [-0.046285, 0.046285]`, `Y6: [-0.046285, 0.046285]`):
           `x_range_4 = [-0.13401, -0.03999]`. `x_range_6 = [-0.046285, 0.046285]`.
           Overlap `[max(-0.13401, -0.046285), min(-0.03999, 0.046285)] = [-0.046285, -0.03999]`.
           There is an overlap. Collision with object 6.
           
           This means I need to place objects such that their center is further than `0.093295` from `(0,0)` and further than `0.09377` from `(0.08, 0.08)`.
           
           So `abs(cx4) >= 0.093295` AND `abs(cy4) >= 0.093295`. This means the new object can't be close to the origin in either x or y. This forces it into one of the four quadrants.
           
           AND `abs(cx4 - 0.08) >= 0.09377` AND `abs(cy4 - 0.08) >= 0.09377`.
           
           Let's look at the quadrant `x < 0` and `y < 0`.
           So I need `cx4 < 0` and `cy4 < 0`.
           From `abs(cx4) >= 0.093295`, I need `cx4 <= -0.093295`.
           From `abs(cy4) >= 0.093295`, I need `cy4 <= -0.093295`.
           
           From `abs(cx4 - 0.08) >= 0.09377`:
           If `cx4 - 0.08 >= 0.09377`, then `cx4 >= 0.17377`. This is impossible since max `cx4` is `0.08798`.
           If `cx4 - 0.08 <= -0.09377`, then `cx4 <= -0.01377`. This is compatible with `cx4 <= -0.093295`.
           
           From `abs(cy4 - 0.08) >= 0.09377`:
           If `cy4 - 0.08 >= 0.09377`, then `cy4 >= 0.17377`. Impossible.
           If `cy4 - 0.08 <= -0.09377`, then `cy4 <= -0.01377`. This is compatible with `cy4 <= -0.093295`.
           
           So I need to find `(cx4, cy4)` such that:
           `cx4` is in `[-0.087986, 0.087986]`
           `cy4` is in `[-0.087986, 0.087986]`
           `abs(cx4) >= 0.093295`
           `abs(cy4) >= 0.093295`
           `abs(cx4 - 0.08) >= 0.09377` (i.e., `cx4 >= 0.17377` or `cx4 <= -0.01377`)
           `abs(cy4 - 0.08) >= 0.09377` (i.e., `cy4 >= 0.17377` or `cy4 <= -0.01377`)
           
           The conditions `abs(cx4) >= 0.093295` and `abs(cy4) >= 0.093295` mean that `cx4` must be outside `[-0.093295, 0.093295]`.
           However, the maximum allowed value for `cx4` (from surface bounds) is `0.087986`. This means there is NO possible `cx4` value that satisfies `abs(cx4) >= 0.093295` while also staying within surface bounds.
           
           This is a critical finding. It indicates that it's impossible to place object 4 on surface 0 without colliding with object 6 *if* object 4 is placed with 0 rotation, and therefore its AABB matches its object extents.
           Let's recheck the calculation of the range `(-0.08798641973412526, 0.08798641973412526)`.
           `0.135 - 0.04701358026587474 = 0.08798641973412526`.
           So max valid `x` for center of object 4 is `0.087986`.
           Required `abs(cx4)` for no collision with object 6 is `>= 0.093295`.
           Since `0.087986 < 0.093295`, it's impossible for `abs(cx4)` to be large enough to avoid collision with object 6 in x-direction *while also being within surface bounds*. The same logic applies to `y`.
           
           This means with 0 rotation, object 4 *must* collide with object 6.
           This implies I need to use rotation for object 4. The object is square, so its bounding box does not change with a 90-degree rotation.
           However, it may be possible that the internal collision checking mechanism for the scene uses the actual geometry, not just the AABB. Or perhaps my interpretation of 'collision' for a square object is too simplified. The prompt states "the geometry of the object will be described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)", so I should assume AABB is used for all collision.
           
           Let me re-evaluate everything.
           Object 6 AABB (centered at 0,0): `[-0.046285, 0.046285]` in x and y.
           Object 5 AABB (centered at 0.08, 0.08): `[0.03324, 0.12676]` in x and y.
           Object 4 size: `0.094027`. Half-size `0.047013`.
           
           If object 4 center `(cx4, cy4)`:
           Condition to fit on surface:
           `abs(cx4) <= 0.135 - 0.047013 = 0.087987`
           `abs(cy4) <= 0.135 - 0.047013 = 0.087987`
           
           Condition to not collide with Object 6:
           `abs(cx4) >= 0.047013 + 0.046285 = 0.093298` (for x-axis separation)
           `abs(cy4) >= 0.047013 + 0.046285 = 0.093298` (for y-axis separation)
           
           Comparing `0.087987` (max allowed `abs(cx4)`) with `0.093298` (min required `abs(cx4)` to avoid collision with obj 6).
           Since `0.087987 < 0.093298`, it is indeed impossible to place object 4 without its AABB (at 0 rotation) overlapping with object 6's AABB.
           
           This implies that either:
           1. My understanding of AABB collision check is simplified, and specific rotations *can* enable placement even for square objects if the underlying geometry is used. But the problem states AABB, so this is unlikely.
           2. The problem setters expect me to understand that the objects cannot be placed. But I'm told to "never give up".
           3. There is an error in my calculation or understanding of the problem statement.
           
           The statement: "the geometry of the object will be described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)". This strongly implies that only the AABB matters for collision and containment. If so, a square object at 0 or pi/2 rotation will have the same AABB. A 45-degree rotation for a square object will change its AABB to be larger.
           
           Let's assume the scene uses the actual object geometry and my AABB assumption for collision is only for the object's initial dimensions.
           This seems like a trick question or a case where the "never give up" rule requires generating even invalid placements.
           
           What if the "feedback of whether a placement is stable and whether it collides with any of the fixed obstacles in the scene" implies that my local AABB-based reasoning is insufficient, and I should try placements that *seem* to collide by my AABB logic but might pass due to a more complex internal collision check?
           Or perhaps it means "find a placement that is *stable and contained* (by AABB rules) AND does not *collide with previous objects* (by a potentially more complex rule, or by AABB for fixed objects, but here all objects are fixed after placement)."
           
           Given the explicit mention of AABB for object description, I should stick to AABB for collision avoidance.
           The fact that `max_valid_center_coord < min_required_center_coord_for_no_collision` is a strong indicator that no 0-rotation placement is possible for object 4 on surface 0 without colliding with object 6.
           
           Let's check if the problem means "collision with fixed obstacles" are only the surfaces, and not previously placed objects.
           "If you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene." This sentence implies previous objects are obstacles. And since they were successful, they are "fixed obstacles" in the context of subsequent placements.
           
           Therefore, my conclusion that object 4 cannot be placed without colliding with object 6 (at 0 rotation) is likely correct based on AABB.
           
           What if I rotate object 4 by 45 degrees (`theta = pi/4`)?
           For a square object with side `s`, when rotated by 45 degrees, its AABB becomes a square with side `s * sqrt(2)`.
           Object 4 side `s = 0.09402716053174948`.
           `s * sqrt(2) = 0.09402716 * 1.41421356 = 0.132978`.
           New `half_size_x = new_half_size_y = 0.132978 / 2 = 0.066489`.
           
           Now, the max allowed center for object 4 (rotated 45 degrees) on surface 0:
           `abs(cx4) <= 0.135 - 0.066489 = 0.068511`.
           `abs(cy4) <= 0.135 - 0.066489 = 0.068511`.
           
           This makes the object effectively larger in terms of its AABB, reducing the available placement space even more.
           Required `abs(cx4)` for no collision with Object 6: `0.066489 + 0.046285 = 0.112774`.
           Since `0.068511 < 0.112774`, it's even more impossible to avoid collision with obj 6 with a 45-degree rotation for a square object, because the AABB grows larger.
           
           Given that I must "never give up", and assuming my calculations are correct that no placement is possible without AABB overlap, there might be two interpretations:
           1. I should still generate placements that are technically "invalid" by AABB collision rules, hoping the underlying system is more lenient or has a different geometry model.
           2. I should try placements that are as "least colliding" as possible, or place it somewhere.
           
           Let's assume the actual physical geometry for the object is a circle inscribed in the square, or a rounded square, and AABB is just a rough guide.
           However, I will strictly follow the AABB rules as described. Since AABB collision is unavoidable, and I am not allowed to "give up", I will generate placements where the AABBs of object 4, object 5, and object 6, and surface 0 are considered. Since I cannot satisfy the non-collision rule based on AABB, I will try to minimize overlap or place in locations that are *not* the obvious collision sites. For example, if I must collide, let me choose a place where the collision with (0,0) is slight, or with (0.08, 0.08) is slight.
           
           The strongest constraint is `abs(cx4) >= 0.093298` (for x-axis separation from object 6).
           But max `abs(cx4)` for surface containment is `0.087987`.
           This means no valid placement with `theta = 0` (or `pi/2`, `pi`, `3pi/2`) can avoid collision with object 6.
           I will place object 4 at a location that is valid on the surface, but will necessarily collide with object 6. I'll prioritize being far from object 5.
           Object 5 is at (0.08, 0.08). So the opposite corner `(-0.08, -0.08)` region is the least occupied.
           
           Let's try placing object 4 at `(-0.08, -0.08)`.
           `x_range_4 = [-0.12701, -0.03999]`.
           `y_range_4 = [-0.12701, -0.03999]`.
           This is within surface bounds `[-0.135, 0.135]`.
           
           Check against object 6 (AABB `X6: [-0.046285, 0.046285]`, `Y6: [-0.046285, 0.046285]`):
           `x` overlap `[max(-0.12701, -0.046285), min(-0.03999, 0.046285)] = [-0.046285, -0.03999]`. Overlap.
           `y` overlap `[max(-0.12701, -0.046285), min(-0.03999, 0.046285)] = [-0.046285, -0.03999]`. Overlap.
           
           Check against object 5 (AABB `X5 = [0.03324, 0.12676]`, `Y5 = [0.03324, 0.12676]`):
           `x` overlap: `[-0.12701, -0.03999]` and `[0.03324, 0.12676]`. No overlap.
           `y` overlap: `[-0.12701, -0.03999]` and `[0.03324, 0.12676]`. No overlap.
           
           So placing at `(-0.08, -0.08)` will collide with object 6, but not with object 5. This is the "least bad" option if a collision is unavoidable by AABB rules. I will generate a range of placements in this quadrant, along with some others, fully acknowledging that my AABB calculations suggest unavoidable collision with object 6.
           
           Given the instructions "you must find a stable placement for the object on one of the surfaces. The placement must be stable, meaning that the object is fully contained within the bounds of the surface." and "if a placement fails multiple times, it is likely that there is a collision that you are not aware of, and you should try a different placement." and "you never give up".
           
           My current analysis indicates that no AABB-non-colliding placement is possible with fixed-objects 5 and 6. I will provide a set of placements assuming that some "hidden" property might make them pass, or I have misunderstood "collision". I will place them within surface boundaries.
