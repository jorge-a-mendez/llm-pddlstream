           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of one surface, surface 0, which is an AABB defined by `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. The object, with ID 5, has x and y extents of `(0.07, 0.07)`. I need to find 50 stable placements for this object on the given surface. A placement is stable if the object is fully contained within the surface. I will try to place the object in various positions and orientations on surface 0, ensuring it does not go beyond the surface boundaries.
           
           The surface has a width of `4.8 - 4.2 = 0.6` and a height of `0.0 - (-0.6) = 0.6`. The object has a side length of `0.07`. This means I can place the object in many positions and orientations without it overflowing the surface.
           
           I'll start by placing the object upright (theta=0) and then rotate it by pi/2, and so on. I will also vary the x and y coordinates within the bounds of the surface, taking into account the object's dimensions.
           
           For theta = 0 or pi, the object's effective dimensions are (0.07, 0.07).
           For theta = pi/2 or 3*pi/2, the object's effective dimensions are (0.07, 0.07).
           Since the object is square, its effective dimensions remain (0.07, 0.07) regardless of rotation.
           
           The allowed x-range for the object's center will be `4.2 + 0.07/2` to `4.8 - 0.07/2`, which is `4.235` to `4.765`.
           The allowed y-range for the object's center will be `-0.6 + 0.07/2` to `0.0 - 0.07/2`, which is `-0.565` to `-0.035`.
           
           I will generate a grid of positions within these ranges and try different rotations.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still consists of surface 0: `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.
           A new object, ID 10, has extents `(0.08929, 0.08929)`. This object is also square.
           I also know that object 5 was successfully placed at `(0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565)`. This means object 5 occupies the region `(4.2, -0.6)` to `(4.27, -0.53)`. I must avoid collision with this previously placed object.
           
           The new object (ID 10) has a side length of approximately 0.0893.
           The allowed x-range for the center of object 10 will be `4.2 + 0.0893/2` to `4.8 - 0.0893/2`, which is `4.24465` to `4.75535`.
           The allowed y-range for the center of object 10 will be `-0.6 + 0.0893/2` to `0.0 - 0.0893/2`, which is `-0.55535` to `-0.04465`.
           
           I need to generate 50 stable placements for object 10 on surface 0, avoiding collision with object 5 at `(0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565)`.
           Object 5's bounding box: `x: [4.2, 4.27]`, `y: [-0.6, -0.53]`.
           
           I will try to place object 10 on the right side or top side of object 5, or simply in other areas of the surface that are far from object 5.
           
           Let's consider placement of object 10 with theta = 0.
           Min x for center: 4.2 + 0.08929/2 = 4.244645
           Max x for center: 4.8 - 0.08929/2 = 4.755355
           Min y for center: -0.6 + 0.08929/2 = -0.555355
           Max y for center: 0.0 - 0.08929/2 = -0.044645
           
           Object 5 is at `(0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565)`. Its bounding box is `(4.2, -0.6)` to `(4.27, -0.53)`.
           
           To avoid collision, if object 10 is to the right of object 5, its left edge `(x_center - 0.08929/2)` must be greater than `4.27`. So `x_center` must be greater than `4.27 + 0.08929/2 = 4.314645`.
           If object 10 is above object 5, its bottom edge `(y_center - 0.08929/2)` must be greater than `-0.53`. So `y_center` must be greater than `-0.53 + 0.08929/2 = -0.485355`.
           
           I will primarily place objects starting from the top-right and moving left and down, avoiding the bottom-left corner where object 5 is.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene has changed significantly. Now there are three surfaces:
           Surface 0: `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6))` (Height 1.2, Width 0.6)
           Surface 1: `((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6))` (Height 1.2, Width 0.6)
           Surface 2: `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))` (Height 0.6, Width 0.6)
           
           Notice that surface 2 is entirely contained within surface 0. A placement on surface 2 is also a placement on surface 0.
           The object (ID 10) has extents `(0.08929, 0.08929)`.
           
           I have information about two previously placed objects:
           Object 5: `(0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565)` on surface 0. Its bounding box is `(4.2, -0.6)` to `(4.27, -0.53)`.
           Object 10 (the same object as the current request, but a previous placement): `(0, 0.0, 4.755, -0.045)` on surface 0. Its bounding box is `(4.71071, -0.08929)` to `(4.8, 0.0)`.
           
           This is a request to place the *same* object (ID 10) again. This implies the previous placement collided with a non-fixed obstacle. Therefore, I must find new placements for object 10 that are stable on *any* of the provided surfaces and do not collide with object 5, and also do not collide with the *previously attempted placement* of object 10. Since the previous placement of object 10 collided, I should avoid that exact placement `(0, 0.0, 4.755, -0.045)`.
           
           Let's list the fixed object bounds:
           Object 5: `x: [4.2, 4.27]`, `y: [-0.6, -0.53]` (on surface 0, which is also surface 2 and part of surface 0)
           Previous attempt for Object 10: `x: [4.71071, 4.8]`, `y: [-0.08929, 0.0]` (on surface 0, which is also surface 2 and part of surface 0)
           
           I will focus on surface 1 first, as it's entirely separate from where objects 5 and the previous placement of 10 are. This will guarantee no collision with existing objects.
           Surface 1: `((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6))`
           Object 10 extents: `(0.08929, 0.08929)`
           
           Allowed x-range for center on surface 1: `-4.8 + 0.08929/2` to `-4.2 - 0.08929/2`, which is `-4.755355` to `-4.244645`.
           Allowed y-range for center on surface 1: `-0.6 + 0.08929/2` to `0.6 - 0.08929/2`, which is `-0.555355` to `0.555355`.
           
           I will generate placements on surface 1 first, as it's a safe bet to avoid existing collisions. Then, if I need more, I'll consider surface 0 (avoiding existing objects).

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene and object properties are:
           Surfaces:
           0: `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6))`
           1: `((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6))`
           2: `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`
           
           Object (ID: 6) extents: `(0.07, 0.07)`. This is a square object.
           
           Successfully placed objects (and their effective bounding boxes):
           Object 5: `(0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565)` on surface 0. Bounding Box: `x: [4.2, 4.27]`, `y: [-0.6, -0.53]`.
           Object 10: `(0, 0.0, 4.755, -0.045)` on surface 0. Bounding Box: `x: [4.71071, 4.8]`, `y: [-0.08929, 0.0]`. (Note: This object was given as a "success" twice. The first one was rejected implicitly when a second attempt was requested. However, since it is explicitly listed as a success *now*, it must be considered stable for future placements. My previous assumption that it collided with a non-fixed obstacle was incorrect. This means the second placement of object 10 was unnecessary, but I will consider both its listed successful placements as fixed obstacles).
           Object 10: `(1, 0.0, -4.755, 0.555)` on surface 1. Bounding Box: `x: [-4.8, -4.71071]`, `y: [0.51071, 0.6]`.
           
           So, the fixed obstacles are:
           1. Object 5 (ID 5, size 0.07x0.07) at `(0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565)`: BB `[4.2, 4.27] x [-0.6, -0.53]` on surface 0 (and 2).
           2. Object 10 (ID 10, size 0.089x0.089) at `(0, 0.0, 4.755, -0.045)`: BB `[4.71071, 4.8] x [-0.08929, 0.0]` on surface 0 (and 2).
           3. Object 10 (ID 10, size 0.089x0.089) at `(1, 0.0, -4.755, 0.555)`: BB `[-4.8, -4.71071] x [0.51071, 0.6]` on surface 1.
           
           The new object (ID 6) has extents `(0.07, 0.07)`.
           
           I will try to place object 6 on surface 2 first, as it is the most constrained and will help me place it in a stable way without too much overlap with surface 0. Then I will use other surfaces.
           Surface 2: `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`
           Allowed x-range for center on surface 2: `4.2 + 0.07/2` to `4.8 - 0.07/2`, which is `4.235` to `4.765`.
           Allowed y-range for center on surface 2: `-0.6 + 0.07/2` to `0.0 - 0.07/2`, which is `-0.565` to `-0.035`.
           
           Collision check on Surface 2:
           Object 5 BB: `[4.2, 4.27] x [-0.6, -0.53]`
           Object 10 BB: `[4.71071, 4.8] x [-0.08929, 0.0]`
           
           For object 6 (0.07x0.07), center `(x_c, y_c)`
           Its BB: `[x_c - 0.035, x_c + 0.035] x [y_c - 0.035, y_c + 0.035]`
           
           Avoid collision with Object 5:
           `x_c - 0.035 > 4.27` => `x_c > 4.305` OR
           `x_c + 0.035 < 4.2` => `x_c < 4.165` (not possible on surface 2) OR
           `y_c - 0.035 > -0.53` => `y_c > -0.495` OR
           `y_c + 0.035 < -0.6` => `y_c < -0.635` (not possible on surface 2)
           
           So, to avoid Object 5, I need either `x_c > 4.305` or `y_c > -0.495`.
           
           Avoid collision with Object 10:
           `x_c - 0.035 > 4.8` => `x_c > 4.835` (not possible on surface 2) OR
           `x_c + 0.035 < 4.71071` => `x_c < 4.67571` OR
           `y_c - 0.035 > 0.0` => `y_c > 0.035` (not possible on surface 2) OR
           `y_c + 0.035 < -0.08929` => `y_c < -0.12429`
           
           So, to avoid Object 10, I need either `x_c < 4.67571` or `y_c < -0.12429`.
           
           This means I can place object 6 in the middle of surface 2, avoiding both corners.
           For example, a good area would be `x_c` between `4.305` and `4.67571`, and `y_c` between `-0.495` and `-0.12429`.
           Let's try a grid of placements in this safe zone on surface 2.
           
           Placements:
           (2, 0.0, 4.345, -0.155)
           (2, 0.0, 4.345, -0.255)
           (2, 0.0, 4.345, -0.355)
           (2, 0.0, 4.345, -0.455)
           (2, 0.0, 4.445, -0.155)
           (2, 0.0, 4.445, -0.255)
           (2, 0.0, 4.445, -0.355)
           (2, 0.0, 4.445, -0.455)
           (2, 0.0, 4.545, -0.155)
           (2, 0.0, 4.545, -0.255)
           (2, 0.0, 4.545, -0.355)
           (2, 0.0, 4.545, -0.455)
           (2, 0.0, 4.645, -0.155)
           (2, 0.0, 4.645, -0.255)
           (2, 0.0, 4.645, -0.355)
           (2, 0.0, 4.645, -0.455)
           
           Now for Surface 1: `((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6))`
           Object 10 BB on surface 1: `[-4.8, -4.71071] x [0.51071, 0.6]`
           Allowed x-range for center on surface 1 (for object 6): `-4.8 + 0.07/2` to `-4.2 - 0.07/2`, which is `-4.765` to `-4.235`.
           Allowed y-range for center on surface 1 (for object 6): `-0.6 + 0.07/2` to `0.6 - 0.07/2`, which is `-0.565` to `0.565`.
           
           Avoid collision with Object 10 on surface 1:
           `x_c - 0.035 > -4.71071` => `x_c > -4.67571` OR
           `x_c + 0.035 < -4.8` => `x_c < -4.835` (not possible) OR
           `y_c - 0.035 > 0.6` => `y_c > 0.635` (not possible) OR
           `y_c + 0.035 < 0.51071` => `y_c < 0.47571`
           
           So, to avoid Object 10 on surface 1, I need `x_c > -4.67571` or `y_c < 0.47571`.
           Let's place object 6 primarily in the bottom-right part of surface 1.

           (1, 0.0, -4.465, 0.435)
           
           And finally surface 0, which is larger than surface 2.
           Surface 0: `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6))`
           Allowed x-range: `4.235` to `4.765`.
           Allowed y-range: `-0.565` to `0.565`.
           Collisions for object 6 (0.07x0.07) on Surface 0:
           Object 5 BB: `[4.2, 4.27] x [-0.6, -0.53]`
           Object 10 BB: `[4.71071, 4.8] x [-0.08929, 0.0]`
           
           For placements on surface 0, I'll aim for the upper part, especially `y > 0.0`.
