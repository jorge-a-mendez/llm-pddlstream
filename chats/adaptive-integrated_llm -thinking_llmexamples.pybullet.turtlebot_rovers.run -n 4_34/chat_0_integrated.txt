           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Dissection**
           
           Okay, here's my understanding of the situation. I'm tasked with devising a plan to achieve a specific goal: the creation of a new axiom (`new-axiom@0()`). This axiom is true under specific conditions, which involve imaging and analyzing various objects (stones and soil) with two rovers.
           
           I see that the rovers are initially in specific configurations, and I have a set of available actions to manipulate the environment. My analysis must incorporate constraints on configurations and distances, ensuring I respect the system's geometric bounds and the preconditions required by the actions.
           
           **Understanding the Constraints**
           
           A major constraint is the use of continuous parameters that define configurations and rays. I must consider how to provide continuous values within the allowed range. I should pay attention to the explicit rule of not using actions or continuous values not mentioned.
           
           The challenge is to figure out how to satisfy predicates such as `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` and how to satisfy predicates like `atconf(?v, ?q)`, which is critical for making `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` usable. I see a conflict as my actions are limited, the distances are constrained, and there are explicit configurations to be followed.
           
           **Developing a Plan**
           
           The initial state constrains the rover's moves. They are effectively fixed and can *only* move to pre-defined states.
           
           I understand that *I must* use the continuous values and '#' configurations given and follow the rule of "a different continuous value for each (rover, target object) pair". The continuous configurations are tied to the target and a given robot pair. For each (rover, target object) pair, I need to compute distances.
           
           This clarifies the issue: *I must satisfy all prerequisites to complete my goal*, I have to analyze two objects (a stone, and soil) with one rover.
           
           I then identified the actions:
           
           1.  **calibrate:** calibrate the camera
           2.  **take_image:** using the camera, take an image of an object
           3.  **send_image:** send the taken image
           4.  **sample_rock:** to sample rock
           5.  **send_analysis:** send rock for analysis
           6.  **drop_rock:** make a store free
           
           I then identified all the objects I must work with and their constraints, including all their coordinates.
           
           **Final Plan and Justification**
           
           Given the interpretation, I can create a plan to satisfy all goal preconditions. The plan will first take and transmit all images. The images must be calibrated and taken. Afterwards, rock sampling and analysis are completed, and a final drop rock clears the conditions.
           
           **Note:** This is an approximation. There are ambiguities in the continuous values. I must assume the system is not too sensitive to these parameters and make geometric approximations.

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Plan's Feasibility**
           
           Okay, the user flagged that the previous plan violated a key constraint: it utilized actions not present in the provided list of "valid action instances." That's a dealbreaker, as the rules are quite clear: if it's not on the list, it's off-limits.
           
           Looking at the restricted list of allowed actions – essentially, just `move` and `drop_rock` – it's immediately apparent we have a problem. Let's revisit the target state, `new-axiom@0()`, clause by clause. The initial `atconf` and `free` predicates are trivially satisfied, as things stand. However, the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates are going to be impossible to achieve.
           
           To achieve those predicates, we need actions like `send_image`, `take_image`, `calibrate`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. These actions are *critical* to any meaningful analysis or image transfer, as any competent professional would know. Each of these actions, in turn, has preconditions that require other actions, and they *all* depend on actions that simply aren't in the provided list. We're missing the entire image acquisition and analysis pipeline!
           
           Since we can't fulfill those `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` subgoals, it's a logical impossibility to satisfy the entire goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is a conjunction. A single unsatisfied conjunctive element breaks the chain. Therefore, I can't generate a valid plan given these rigid constraints. The user needs to understand that the goal as specified is, in the current context, unreachable. I'll flag the impossibility and provide an explanation. There's no point in returning a non-existent plan, right?
