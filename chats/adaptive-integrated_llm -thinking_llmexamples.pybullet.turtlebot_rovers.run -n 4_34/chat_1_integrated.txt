           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The core objective is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` condition. From the axiom, I can see I need to ensure four things: some initial state predicates are true (which they are), and then, four `receivedimage` and two `receivedanalysis` predicates are true.
           
           The initial state already has `atconf`, `free`, and `type`. It's my job to tackle the image and analysis transmissions. The key is coordinating two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, and ensuring they're at the correct configurations to communicate with the lander, `v9`.
           
           I can divide the plan into two parallel tracks: `v14` will handle imaging, and `v12` will handle rock analysis. I have to make the key move configurations work out, but I'm confident I can make this plan.
           
           **Rover Coordination and Configuration**
           
           `v14` needs to image several objectives: `v17, v18, v19, v20` using the available camera `v10` and send the images to lander `v9` via mode `v11`.
           
           To send images, `v14` needs to be configured as `comvisible`. To image, `v14` needs to be at a specified configuration `#o3` (imagevisible) relative to all of the objectives. To simplify, I'll have the robot calibrate and take images while at `#o3` and send the images to lander `v9`.
           
           `v12` needs to sample and analyze rock `v4` and soil `v5`, and send the results to `v9` (with a mode that also matches `v11`).
           
           To sample and analyze, `v12` will need to be configured at a defined configuration `#o5`, and it must sample the rocks there.
           To send analysis, `v12` needs to communicate with `v9` at configuration `#o0`
           
           **Image Plan for `v14`**
           
           Here's the plan for `v14`:
           
           1.  Move to a good initial starting location `v14` from its current configuration `v15`, to `#o3`
           2.  Calibrate and take images sequentially for each of the four objectives, including `calibrate` and `take_image` actions.
           3.  Move to the communication spot `#o0`.
           4.  Send the images.
           5.  Move back to `v15`
           
           **Analysis Plan for `v12`**
           
           Here's the plan for `v12`:
           
           1.  Move to sampling configuration `#o5`.
           2.  Sample and analyze the first object, `v4`, and then `drop_rock`
           3.  Sample and analyze the second object, `v5`, and then `drop_rock`
           4.  Move to communication location `#o0`.
           5.  Send the analysis for each sample.
           6.  `drop_rock`
           7.  Move back to starting location `v13`.
           
           **Configuration Details and Continuous Values**
           
           I'm confident in the structure. The challenge is in the configuration continuous values (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`).
           
           `#o0` (comvisible) should be a configuration near `v9` (lander) that's reachable by both `v12` and `v14`. I'll place that configuration at  `(-1.5, -1.8)`.
           
           `#o3` (imagevisible) should be a configuration that can "see" all objectives: `v17, v18, v19, v20`.
           I need a shared, unobstructed, view. Let's place it at `(0.015, 1.985)`
           
           `#o5` (above): must allow sampling `v4` and `v5` (rock and soil). Since there's no requirement on visibility here, I'll place this somewhere between the sample points to allow simultaneous operation.
           
           Final values:
           `#o0` for `v14`: `(-1.5, -1.8)`
           `#o0` for `v12`: `(-1.5, -1.8)`
           `#o3` for `v14`: `(0.015, 1.985)`
           `#o5` for `v12`: `(1.55, -0.155)`
           
           **Final Plan**
           
           Here's the complete, final action sequence:
           
           1.  `move(v
)

Model:     **Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The core objective is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` condition. From the axiom, I can see I need to ensure four things: some initial state predicates are true (which they are), and then, four `receivedimage` and two `receivedanalysis` predicates are true.
           
           The initial state already has `atconf`, `free`, and `type`. It's my job to tackle the image and analysis transmissions. The key is coordinating two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, and ensuring they're at the correct configurations to communicate with the lander, `v9`.
           
           I can divide the plan into two parallel tracks: `v14` will handle imaging, and `v12` will handle rock analysis. I have to make the key move configurations work out, but I'm confident I can make this plan.
           
           **Rover Coordination and Configuration**
           
           `v14` needs to image several objectives: `v17, v18, v19, v20` using the available camera `v10` and send the images to lander `v9` via mode `v11`.
           
           To send images, `v14` needs to be configured as `comvisible`. To image, `v14` needs to be at a specified configuration `#o3` (imagevisible) relative to all of the objectives. To simplify, I'll have the robot calibrate and take images while at `#o3` and send the images to lander `v9`.
           
           `v12` needs to sample and analyze rock `v4` and soil `v5`, and send the results to `v9` (with a mode that also matches `v11`).
           
           To sample and analyze, `v12` will need to be configured at a defined configuration `#o5`, and it must sample the rocks there.
           To send analysis, `v12` needs to communicate with `v9` at configuration `#o0`
           
           **Image Plan for `v14`**
           
           Here's the plan for `v14`:
           
           1.  Move to a good initial starting location `v14` from its current configuration `v15`, to `#o3`
           2.  Calibrate and take images sequentially for each of the four objectives, including `calibrate` and `take_image` actions.
           3.  Move to the communication spot `#o0`.
           4.  Send the images.
           5.  Move back to `v15`
           
           **Analysis Plan for `v12`**
           
           Here's the plan for `v12`:
           
           1.  Move to sampling configuration `#o5`.
           2.  Sample and analyze the first object, `v4`, and then `drop_rock`
           3.  Sample and analyze the second object, `v5`, and then `drop_rock`
           4.  Move to communication location `#o0`.
           5.  Send the analysis for each sample.
           6.  `drop_rock`
           7.  Move back to starting location `v13`.
           
           **Configuration Details and Continuous Values**
           
           I'm confident in the structure. The challenge is in the configuration continuous values (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`).
           
           `#o0` (comvisible) should be a configuration near `v9` (lander) that's reachable by both `v12` and `v14`. I'll place that configuration at  `(-1.5, -1.8)`.
           
           `#o3` (imagevisible) should be a configuration that can "see" all objectives: `v17, v18, v19, v20`.
           I need a shared, unobstructed, view. Let's place it at `(0.015, 1.985)`

           Final values:
           `#o0` for `v14`: `(-1.5, -1.8)`
           `#o0` for `v12`: `(-1.5, -1.8)`
           `#o3` for `v14`: `(0.015, 1.985)`
           `#o5` for `v12`: `(1.55, -0.155)`

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating Continuous Configurations for Rover Navigation and Task Execution**
           
           After the initial plan failed due to obstacle collisions, I've returned to the drawing board to re-evaluate my continuous configuration choices, focusing on communication (`#o0`) and imaging (`#o3`) tasks.
           
           **Communication Configuration:**
           
           *   **Obstacle:** The initial plan for communication between rovers and the lander (`v9`) resulted in collisions. I need to ensure rovers are *near* but *not* on the lander.
           *   **Revised Strategy:** I'll reposition the rovers *outside* the lander's bounding box. For `v14`, this means moving to a communication position near `v9` that is collision-free (e.g., to `-1.0, -1.5`). I will do something similar with rover `v12`, moving to a communication spot outside `v9`'s bounding box (e.g., to `0.0, -1.5`).
           
           **Imaging Configuration:**
           
           *   **Obstacle:** The most significant challenge is a thin wall (`v21`) at `x=0` that potentially obstructs the view of multiple imaging targets (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`). A single imaging configuration could not view all targets. I had to assume the continuous planner for `test-cfree-ray-conf-negative` would be smart enough to test for ray occlusion with `v21` and that by ensuring the rover body is out of the path of `v21`, the rays could be assumed to be viable. This led to a revised `#o3 = (0.06, 1.95)`.
           *   **Revised Strategy:** I must define a single `imagevisible` config outside the bounding box of `v21` on the positive `x` side (e.g., `(0.06, 1.95)`) for rover `v14`. I'm going to assume the `imagerange` predicate is valid if a non-collision configuration can be found for it and the continuous planner will find a working path.
           
           **Revised Continuous Parameter Selection:**
           
           I have chosen the following continuous parameter values to ensure all constraints are met:
           
           *   **`#o0` for `v14` to `v9`:** `(-1.0, -1.5)`
           *   **`#o0` for `v12` to `v9`:** `(0.0, -1.5)`
           *   **`#o3` for `v14` to `v17, v18, v19, v20`:** `(0.06, 1.95)`
           *   **`#o5` for `v12` to `v4, v5`:** `(1.55, -0.155)`
           
           **Detailed Plan Check and Goal Verification**
           
           My revised plan involves `v14` focusing on the imaging tasks and `v12` dedicated to sampling and analysis. I will move both to their designated configurations without collision. After completion, all conditions of `new-axiom@0()` (e.g., all rover final states, all image goals, and sample goals) are met.
           
           I am assuming that the `imagerange` predicate and other predicates for `imagevisible` work and are satisfied with the specified configurations for each task, because of the available action instances. Given this interpretation, all tasks in the mission are possible to complete.

(Thoughts: **Updated Configuration Plan**
           
           Alright, after reviewing the feedback, I've got a much clearer picture of the constraints. The primary focus is avoiding collisions, especially with `v21` (the vertical wall) and ensuring reachability and visibility. My previous attempts were invalidated, so I need to refine the continuous parameters. Here's my revised plan, keeping in mind the lessons learned:
           
           1.  **Communication Configuration (`#o0`) for `v14`:** I'll set `#o0` for rover `v14` to **(-1.3, -1.6)**. This position gets me close enough to the lander `v9` for communication while being outside its AABB and away from `v21`. This should satisfy the `comvisible` constraint. I'm assuming the planner can now navigate a reachable path between its initial position at `v15` at (-1.0, -1.75) and this new coordinate.
           
           2.  **Communication Configuration (`#o0`) for `v12`:** For rover `v12`, I'll use **(0.1, -1.75)** for `#o0`. This puts the rover just outside `v21`, avoiding the collision from my prior attempt at (0, -1.5). The distance to the lander, centered at (-1.9, -2.0), will still be within the 4-unit `comvisible` range.
           
           3.  **Imaging Configuration (`#o3`) for `v14`:** For the imaging task, I'll place rover `v14` at **(0.1, 1.95)**. This choice puts the rover on the positive side of `v21`, just outside the problematic wall. I'm relying on the `imagevisible` and `imagerange` predicates to ensure the plan can capture all the objectives from this location. I'm assuming the PDDL planner can find a collision-free path from the starting position to this position. I'm putting more faith in the validity of the visibility constraints given.
           
           4.  **Sampling Configuration (`#o5`) for `v12`:** This part remains unchanged. The configuration **(1.55, -0.155)** for rover `v12` to sample the stone and soil remains sound. It's distant from `v21` and should satisfy the `above` and reachability constraints.
           
           The overall strategy remains as before, but with these new locations, the rovers will execute the following:
           *   **Rover V14:**  Moves to `#o3`, calibrates, takes images, moves to `#o0` to send the images, and returns.
           *   **Rover V12:** Moves to `#o5`, samples the stone, drops it, samples the soil, moves to `#o0` and sends analysis, drops both samples and then returns.
           
           This refined plan should address the previous collision problems and satisfy all requirements. The problem description suggests that the given `imagevisible` and `comvisible` facts are valid, and my job is to find locations that satisfy reachability and collision constraints. I feel confident that this new setup will work!

           *   **Rover V12:** Moves to `#o5`, samples the stone, drops it, samples the soil, moves to `#o0` and sends analysis, drops both samples and then returns.
           
           This refined plan should address the previous collision problems and satisfy all requirements. The problem description suggests that the given `imagevisible` and `comvisible` facts are valid, and my job is to find locations that satisfy reachability and collision constraints. I feel confident that this new setup will work!

(Thoughts: **My Strategic Repositioning for Rover Operations**
           
           Okay, so I’ve gotten feedback regarding some collisions with the previous configuration. I need to make some adjustments to the continuous parameters for both communication and imaging to sidestep these obstacles, namely the vertical strip `v21` and the block `v22` in the upper-right area. My main goal remains the same: satisfying the criteria in `new-axiom@0()`, but this time with some careful recalibration.
           
           **Let's break down the thought process:**
           
           **Initial Assessment:** I've reviewed the initial setup. My rovers, `v12` and `v14`, are at known starting points. The key objective: image and analyze rock and soil samples at the four specific locations I'm supposed to analyze. I need to keep in mind the current position of the lander `v9`,  the obstacles `v21`, `v22`, and those imaging objectives.
           
           **Task Allocation:** The roles are staying the same: `v12` is on sample duty and `v14` is imaging. It's time to refine those continuous values.
           
           **Parameter Refinement:**
           
           1.  **Communication Configuration (`#o0` for `v14` and `v12`):**
               *   **Rover `v14`**: I need to get in touch with `v9` without any base collisions. My prior attempt got too close, and I need to move it into communication range but at a safer distance. This means staying clear of `v21` and also well outside `v9`'s AABB. I am now confident about the solution `(-1.2, -1.5)`. This is clearly on the right and above the lander's zone and well clear of the strip.
               *   **Rover `v12`**: I'm steering clear of the pesky vertical obstacle (`v21`) for communication. I'm going with `(0.5, -1.75)` to the right of the area. It is reachable and I am well within the communication range.
           
           2.  **Imaging Configuration (`#o3` for `v14`):**
               *   This is tricky. I have to find one spot for `v14` where it can grab images of all four targets without clashing with the obstacles and respecting range limitations. My previous attempts put the camera in range but colliding with the vertical strip `v21` in a previous configuration.  I need to be collision-free. After thorough analysis of collision zones, I must assume that, given that the plan states `imagevisible` is a valid starting fact, I just need to choose a point without colliding. The approach is now `(-0.2, 1.9)`.
               *   I've run through the calculations again (reachability, line of sight, range) and come to the conclusion that this configuration satisfies the problem's geometric constraints and, importantly, is collision-free with respect to the rover base.
           
           **Finalized Configurations:**
           
           *   Comms:  `#o0(v14): (-1.2, -1.5)`, `#o0(v12): (0.5, -1.75)`.
           *   Imaging:  `#o3: (-0.2, 1.9)`
           
           I am going to trust that my new camera location is valid and not worry about any small discrepancies, given I know the solution space contains a successful plan.
           
           Let's go.
