           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning on Goal Reachability**
           
           Okay, so I'm looking at this planning problem, and the goal is pretty clear: get a bunch of objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, `v18`) on top of `v20`. The key here is the `on` predicate, which depends on `supported` (which is pretty much given) and `atpose`.  My job is to figure out if I can manipulate these objects to achieve this final configuration.
           
           Breaking it down, each object needs to have its `atpose` changed from its initial state (currently on `v11`) to a specific pose on `v20` (pose `#o2` seems to be the target).  The initial setup is known: the `atpose` of these objects on `v11` and also facts like `supported` which is key to achieving the goal.
           
           Now, my initial thought is a straightforward plan:  `pick` each object from its starting point, then `place` it onto `v20` at the designated pose. However, the available actions are severely limited.  The only action instance I'm given is a trivial `move_base`.
           
           This is a problem!  I'm an expert planner, and I know that I need `pick` and `place` actions to modify the `atpose` of the objects.  Since no `pick` or `place` instances are included in the available actions, it's immediately clear that I can't directly manipulate the objects to satisfy the goal's `on` conditions.
           
           Even if I wanted to use other actions, there's a dependency on the provided axioms and initial state; I can't achieve `atpose` changes that are needed for `on` to be true.
           
           So, after a thorough review, my conclusion is clear: **the goal is unreachable** with the restricted action set. I can't change the crucial `atpose` facts, and without those changes, I cannot satisfy the goal's requirements. The `move_base` action isn't going to help me here, it's merely a cost addition.
