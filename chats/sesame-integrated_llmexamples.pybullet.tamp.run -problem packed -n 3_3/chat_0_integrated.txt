           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable objects: v8, v12, and v14. They are currently located on object v11. The goal is to place all three objects (v8, v12, and v14) on object v16. The robot arm v4 is currently at arm configuration v5, and its base is at configuration v3. The robot needs to pick each object from its current location and place it on v16. Since there are three objects and they all need to be on v16, we will need to pick and place each one individually.
           
           We have a common goal pose `(#o2)` for all objects on `v16`. We also have pre-defined `kin` actions that use this pose `(#o2)`. Since the goal is to place all three objects on `v16`, we will use the `(#o2)` pose for all of them. The `supported` facts indicate that `v16` is a valid surface for this pose.
           
           The plan will involve picking each object from its current pose and placing it on `v16` at the `(#o2)` pose. We need to define specific continuous values for the `(#o2)` pose for each object such that they don't collide.
           
           The objects are v8, v12, and v14.
           Current locations:
           - v8 at v9 (on v11)
           - v12 at v13 (on v11)
           - v14 at v15 (on v11)
           
           Target location for all: #o2 (on v16).
           
           We'll pick v8 from v9 and place it at #o2 on v16.
           Then pick v12 from v13 and place it at #o2 on v16.
           Finally, pick v14 from v15 and place it at #o2 on v16.

           Please provide a plan and poses that achieves the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all poses are valid and stable.

           The plan will involve picking each object from its current pose and placing it on `v16` at the `(#o2)` pose. We need to define specific continuous values for the `(#o2)` pose for each object such that they don't collide. The previous attempt had issues with stability, where the AABB of the object was not contained within the AABB of the surface `v16`. `v16` has AABB of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           For `v8`, the AABB is `((-0.052, -0.599), (0.032, -0.515))`
           For `v12`, the AABB is `((-0.163, -0.352), (-0.067, -0.256))`
           For `v14`, the AABB is `((0.186, -0.31), (0.278, -0.218))`
           
           Looking at the AABB's, the x and y dimensions are very small. The issue with stability might be that the provided object AABBs (v8, v12, v14) are not relative to their own object frame but might be global, or represent a small part of the object. Since `v16`'s AABB is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`, a suitable pose for these small objects could be near the center of v16. We should try to place them close to the origin (0,0) of v16 to ensure stability. We will adjust the poses slightly for each object to avoid collision with each other while being on v16.
           
           Let's use the following poses:
           - v8: (0.0, 0.0, 0.825, 0.0) - centered.
           - v12: (0.05, 0.0, 0.825, 0.0) - slightly shifted in x.
           - v14: (-0.05, 0.0, 0.825, 0.0) - slightly shifted in x.
           
           Given the small AABB's of v8, v12, and v14 provided, it is likely that these are not the full bounding boxes but rather some sub-part of the objects. Assuming the objects are relatively small compared to the `v16` surface, placing them near the center or slightly offset should be stable within `v16`'s AABB. The `z` value for placement should be above the surface, so assuming 0.781 is the surface height for v11, 0.825 should be fine for v16.
           
           Current locations:
           - v8 at v9 (on v11)
           - v12 at v13 (on v11)
           - v14 at v15 (on v11)
           
           Target location for all: #o2 (on v16).

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', v35) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The error message `Precondition fact ('atbconf', v35) is not satisfied!` indicates that a base configuration `v35` was expected, but the robot is not at that configuration. In the provided initial state, `atbconf(v3)` is true. All `kin` actions in the problem description, such as `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`, use `#o3` as the base configuration. This implies that the robot must be at `#o3` to perform the pick/place operations.
           
           Looking at the available actions, we have `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` and `move_base #o3 v3 #o0`. The robot starts at `v3`, so to perform the pick/place operations, it needs to move to `#o3`.
           
           Let's modify the plan to include a `move_base` action to `bconf(#o3)` before the pick/place operations. After all operations, it would be good to move back to `v3` to ensure `canmove()` is true (though not strictly necessary for the goal).
           
           The `distance` for `basemotion` is calculated based on the x,y coordinates of the base configurations. Since `#o3` is a continuous parameter, we need to provide a value for it. We'll assume `#o3` is a base configuration close to the current location `v3` to minimize `distance` cost, but also suitable for reaching the objects. For simplicity and to satisfy the `basemotion` predicate, we will assign `#o3` the same value as `v3`'s x,y,theta. This effectively means the robot stays in place but fulfills the requirement of being at `#o3`.
           
           The plan will be:
           1. Move base from `v3` to `#o3`.
           2. Pick `v8` from `v9` and place it at `#o2` on `v16`.
           3. Pick `v12` from `v13` and place it at `#o2` on `v16`.
           4. Pick `v14` from `v15` and place it at `#o2` on `v16`.
           
           The updated poses for `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` on `v16` need to be stable and non-colliding. `v16` has AABB `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           For `v8`, the AABB is `((-0.052, -0.599), (0.032, -0.515))`.
           For `v12`, the AABB is `((-0.163, -0.352), (-0.067, -0.256))`.
           For `v14`, the AABB is `((0.186, -0.31), (0.278, -0.218))`.
           
           Given the odd AABB values (which might represent some small parts of objects or be relative to a different frame), I will ensure the *relative* positions of the objects on `v16` are within the bounds and also do not overlap with each other. Assuming the previous problem was due to the calculated bounding box of the objects, not the physical extent. We will stick to values within the allowed range for `v16`.
           
           Let's try these poses, keeping them within the `v16`'s bounds and sufficiently separated:
           - v8: (0.0, 0.0, 0.825, 0.0)
           - v12: (0.05, 0.05, 0.825, 0.0)
