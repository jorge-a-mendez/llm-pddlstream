           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, here's what I've concluded. My task is to devise a plan to reach the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This goal is a conjunction of several conditions, the most crucial being that I need to have received images of objectives `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` in mode `v11`, and also have received the analysis of a stone and a soil sample.
           
           Now, the initial state paints a clear picture: I have two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, both at their initial configurations, with free stores, and a camera onboard. I can see potential targets like `v17`, `v18`, `v19` for imaging, and rocks like `v1`, `v3`, `v4` (stone) and `v5`, `v7`, `v8` (soil) for analysis.
           
           To achieve this, I'd need actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. However, here's the kicker: I'm explicitly told I can *only* use a very limited set of actions: moving the rovers and dropping rocks. These actions simply don't have any direct effects on achieving the key goal conditions!
           
           The only move actions are self loops `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`.  Since no other move actions are available, the rover can't actually move to the appropriate configurations.
           
           Therefore, since the goal depends on receiving images and analyses, which require actions that I *cannot* use, the goal is simply unreachable. It's a fundamental conflict between what the goal demands and what I'm permitted to do. No matter how clever I get, with the given action set, there's no path to victory. The initial configuration is already as good as it can get.
