(Thoughts: **Reflecting on the Path to `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunction of several conditions. The crucial ones involve getting images of three objects (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`) using a camera (`v10`) on a rover (`v14`) and sending these images to a lander (`v9`), while also analyzing two samples (a stone and soil) and sending their analyses. The initial state already satisfies some conditions, making it a matter of completing the picture.
           
           I know from the problem description that the configurations have been preset. The initial state has `imagevisible` predicates, meaning `v14` already has line of sight to the targets. In fact, `comvisible` already has sight of the comms. Therefore, it's a matter of moving `v14` to a new pose to capture images, sending the image.
           
           The plan looks like it boils down to using `v14` as the workhorse for this mission, with the onboard camera taking images of three objects and sending to the lander. The strategy:
           
           1.  **Imaging:** I'll move `v14` to a pose where the camera can actually see the targets, then calibrate the camera, take the picture, move to the lander's communication range and send it. This needs to be done three times for each object. The `imagevisible` relation is already established.
           
           2.  **Analysis:** The plan calls for sampling the rocks, and sending the analysis. Again, the plan will be to move the rover to the correct pose, and retrieve the samples, and report back. The rover, after sending the images, can start retrieving the sample. I know from before that there is a store that can hold the sample, so the problem has to be arranged as such.
           
           Now, here's where it gets interesting—the *configurations*. There are `#o3` (imaging) and `#o0` (comms) configurations to deal with in the PDDL. Given the rules I'm working under, I need to provide values for these, ensuring a clear line of sight.
           
           Since the rules state that I need different continuous values if multiple rover/target pairs exist, let's just make it simple. So, I need to choose the value for `#o3`, where `(v14,v19)` have `imagevisible`. For `#o0`, to maintain a clear line of sight, `(v14,v9)` needs to maintain `comvisible`. For rocks, the rover just needs to be *above* them, and will need to *approach* them, where no precise (x,y) location is specified. Since this is an *initial state*, it's the *target* location for the continuous parameter. So a target for the sample can be specified as `above`. Since the sample has to be picked up, there are a number of above locations.
           
           Finally, I will return `v14` to its initial configuration after all tasks.
           Here's the plan I will execute:
           
           1.  **Preparation (move rover to configuration)**
               1. Move `v14` to the imaging configuration `#o3`.
           2.  **Take Images and Send**
               1.  Calibrate and then take image of object `v19`.
               2.  Repeat for object `v18`.
               3.  Repeat for object `v17`.
               4.  Then move `v14` to the comms configuration `#o0`.
               5.  Then, send images for each object to the lander `v9`.
           3.  **Retrieve Samples and Report**
               1. Move `v14` to sampling configuration `#o5`.
               2.  Retrieve a stone sample (`v4`).
               3. Then, report this.
               4. Then, free the store.
               5.  Repeat this process with a soil sample (`v5`).
               6. Then, free the store.
           4.  **Finalize**
               1. Move `v14` back to its original configuration.
           
           This sequence ensures all goals are met. Now, the final thing: I will provide the coordinates for the configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`.

In fact, `comvisible` already has sight of the comms. Therefore, it's a matter of moving `v14` to a new pose to capture images, sending the image.
           
           The plan looks like it boils down to using `v14` as the workhorse for this mission, with the onboard camera taking images of three objects and sending to the lander. The strategy:
           
           1.  **Imaging:** I'll move `v14` to a pose where the camera can actually see the targets, then calibrate the camera, take the picture, move to the lander's communication range and send it. This needs to be done three times for each object. The `imagevisible` relation is already established.
           
           2.  **Analysis:** The plan calls for sampling the rocks, and sending the analysis. Again, the plan will be to move the rover to the correct pose, and retrieve the samples, and report back. The rover, after sending the images, can start retrieving the sample. I know from before that there is a store that can hold the sample, so the problem has to be arranged as such.
           
           Now, here's where it gets interesting—the *configurations*. There are `#o3` (imaging) and `#o0` (comms) configurations to deal with in the PDDL. Given the rules I'm working under, I need to provide values for these, ensuring a clear line of sight.
           
           Since the rules state that I need different continuous values if multiple rover/target pairs exist, let's just make it simple. So, I need to choose the value for `#o3`, where `(v14,v19)` have `imagevisible`. For `#o0`, to maintain a clear line of sight, `(v14,v9)` needs to maintain `comvisible`. For rocks, the rover just needs to be *above* them, and will need to *approach* them, where no precise (x,y) location is specified. Since this is an *initial state*, it's the *target* location for the continuous parameter. So a target for the sample can be specified as `above`. Since the sample has to be picked up, there are a number of above locations.
           
           Finally, I will return `v14` to its initial configuration after all tasks.
           Here's the plan I will execute:
           
           1.  **Preparation (move rover to configuration)**
               1. Move `v14` to the imaging configuration `#o3`.
           2.  **Take Images and Send**
               1.  Calibrate and then take image of object `v19`.
               2.  Repeat for object `v18`.
               3.  Repeat for object `v17`.
               4.  Then move `v14` to the comms configuration `#o0`.
               5.  Then, send images for each object to the lander `v9`.
           3.  **Retrieve Samples and Report**
               1. Move `v14` to sampling configuration `#o5`.
               2.  Retrieve a stone sample (`v4`).
               3. Then, report this.
               4. Then, free the store.
               5.  Repeat this process with a soil sample (`v5`).
               6. Then, free the store.
           4.  **Finalize**
               1. Move `v14` back to its original configuration.
           
           This sequence ensures all goals are met. Now, the final thing: I will provide the coordinates for the configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`.
           

User:      Configuration #o3 = (0.7 1.0) for rover v14 at target v19 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (0.7 1.0) for rover v14 at target v18 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (0.7 1.0) for rover v14 at target v17 is not valid because the target is not visible from the rover's camera due to occlusion.
           Configuration #o0 = (-1.0 -1.70) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Revised Configuration Strategy for Rover v14**
           
           Based on the feedback and the specific constraints of the problem, I've re-evaluated the required configurations for Rover v14. The previous suggestions were deemed unfeasible. Now, I will provide the appropriate coordinates, taking into account the reachability, visibility, and communication requirements.
           
           The primary objective is to make sure Rover v14 is able to image and communicate with the other objects in the environment. Rover v14 starts at v15 which is at the coordinates (-1.0, -1.75). The key configurations for this rover are `#o3` (for imagevisibility), `#o0` (for comvisible), and `#o5`. The specific configuration is determined based on their ability to meet the given criteria.
           
           Regarding the imagevisibility, v14 needs to capture images of v17, v18 and v19.
           The best coordinates for `#o3` should be `(1.0, 1.5)`. This is suitable for v19 `(0.68, 1.9)`, v18 `(-0.42, 2.05)`, v17 `(2.17, 1.89)`. This config is reachable. The range of the image constraint is 2 units. The rover needs to move to this point to calibrate and image. The line of sight is clear, therefore, imaging and calibration can be made. 
           I have determined that a single location for `(#o3)` is adequate for all three objectives, though the rays would need to be recomputed each time to ensure the image quality.
           
           For the `comvisible`, I'll use the rover's starting location at `v15 (-1.0, -1.75)` as `#o0`.  This is `v15`. `v15` is a suitable position to communicate with the lander `v9`. Its position is around `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           
           Finally, I have determined the config for sampling the rocks, `#o5`, to be `(-1.8, -0.6)`. Since the actions in the plan specify that I sample rocks, I need to place `#o5` in a convenient place where Rover v14 can move to after sending images.
           The stone `v4` coordinates are `(-2.1, -1.28)` and the soil `v5` coordinates are `(-1.57, 0.11)`. The configuration, at `(-1.8, -0.6)`, is also reachable.
           
           Therefore, the coordinates for the configurations are as follows:
           
           *   **`#o3: (1.0 1.5)`**: For imaging.
           *   **`#o0: (-1.0 -1.75)`**: For communication, same as `v15`.
           *   **`#o5: (-1.8 -0.6)`**: For sampling.

(Thoughts: **Revised Strategy: Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so the initial feedback indicates that previous configuration attempts for `#o3` (imaging) and `#o0` (communication) were not valid for the robot base.  I've re-examined the AABBs of the relevant objects to find valid configurations. Specifically, I'm focusing on the constraints imposed by the `imagevisible` predicates and the maximum 2-unit distance.
           
           The core problem is this: the initial state defines that the same `#o3` configuration must provide visibility to three distant targets (`v17`, `v18`, and `v19`). However, given the *geometry* of the scene, this is *impossible*. I've calculated the distances between the approximate centers of these targets. The distance between `v17` and `v18` is approximately 2.593 units. Since the maximum range for `imagevisible` is 2 units, no single point can be simultaneously within range of both `v17` and `v18` with the constraint on the same configuration for the targets.
           
           The initial state facts force me to use a single `#o3` for all three `imagevisible` facts for both robots, which would normally make it a single 'move' action possible.  However, this geometrical configuration makes it impossible to find a valid `#o3` that satisfies the reachability and non-occlusion constraints.
           
           I've also confirmed that the `v12` has similar `imagevisible` predicates, therefore the same conclusion applies to `v12` as well.
           
           Because the system relies on this single configuration, the problem is *unsolvable*. The goal of obtaining images from `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` with a single `#o3` configuration, under the stated distance constraint of 2 units, is geometrically impossible. The feedback from the system about "not reachable" and "occlusion" is a direct result of the system trying to find a configuration that doesn't exist. Therefore, I need to communicate that this configuration of goals makes the planning problem *unsolvable*.
