           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Crux of the Matter: A Mission Unreachable**
           
           My task is to devise a plan to satisfy a specific condition, `new-axiom@0()`, in the "rovers" domain. Upon dissecting this axiom, it becomes clear that its core components hinge on acquiring images and analyses of certain rocks and soil samples. The starting conditions already cover some of the requirements, so the challenge boils down to attaining the remaining goals: receiving images and receiving analyses.
           
           To accomplish this, I must employ actions like sending images, sending analyses, taking images, sampling rocks, and calibrating. However, the problem provides a strict list of allowed actions: moving rovers and dropping rocks. This immediately presents an insurmountable obstacle. The necessary actions to achieve the subgoals (image acquisition and analysis) are explicitly *not* included in the allowed action list.
           
           While I could try to make assumptions or find workarounds, the fundamental structure of the problem prevents it. Even with some clever logic, the inability to take the needed actions makes the primary goal of image and analysis acquisition impossible to reach. Thus, I must conclude that given the restrictive action set, `new-axiom@0()` is simply unattainable from the initial state.
