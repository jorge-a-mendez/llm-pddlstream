           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The core problem is to get four objects – v8, v12, v14, and v16 – all *on* v18.  That's the goal.  Based on the current state, they're all sitting on v11.  To get them onto v18, I need to use a combination of *pick* and *place* actions. I need to move each object to the correct pose on v18.
           
           Here's the problem: The only action available is `move_base`.  This only moves the robot's base. It has no effect on *pick* or *place* operations. And I need those *pick* and *place* operations to manipulate the objects and achieve my goal of getting them *on* v18.
           
           I have facts like `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` in the initial state. This shows that the base will "support" objects at pose `_o2`. To get an object *on* another, I need `atpose(vX, #o2)`. For example, for v8 to be on v18, I need `atpose(v8, #o2)`.
           
           But, currently, I only have `atpose(v8, v9)` from the initial state.  Similarly, v12, v14, and v16 have their own respective *atpose* predicates that are *not* on v18.  To get the *on* predicate true, I'd need to change these *atpose* facts. I'd need to use a *pick* to pick the objects up, *move* the robot to the appropriate pose on v18 and then *place* the objects to set the correct `atpose` predicate.  However, this requires both *pick* and *place* actions.  These actions are not available.
           
           So, since I can only move the base, and not the objects themselves, I can't change the *atpose* predicates to satisfy the *on* predicate and I can't reach the goal. It's a dead end. The `move_base` action isn't going to help me here. The goal, as stated, is simply not achievable with the tools I've been given.
