           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Plan and its Inevitable Failure**
           
           Okay, here's the deal: I'm staring at a goal - getting these four objects, v8, v12, v14, and v16, all stacked neatly on v18. Easy, right? They're currently all chilling on v11. My initial thought process was:  "Okay, simple pick-and-place. Get the robot, v4, to pick each object from its current location and place it on v18 at pose #o2." I needed to keep the robot's base configuration (#o3) the same, so there was no need to use the available `move_base` action instance, which would be a no-op move.
           
           I then built a specific sequence for each object. For example, for object `v12`, the plan would be: `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)` and then `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. It was a seemingly straightforward plan and easy to reason about each precondition.
           
           But, a closer look at the constraints throws a wrench in the works. The task explicitly states I can only use action instances provided, and only `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` is on the list. I am not allowed to utilize `pick` or `place` instances to achieve `on(?o, v18)`. Those are crucial because they're the only actions that modify the location of objects: `atpose(?o, ?p)`. So, without `pick` and `place`, I am stuck. There is simply no way to move those objects from their initial positions to the desired goal on v18, and unfortunately, the goal becomes unreachable due to the restrictions on the set of actions allowed to be used.
