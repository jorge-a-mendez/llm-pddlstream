           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 5) -- 0.07000000000000028, 0.06999999999999995)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single surface, surface 0, which is a rectangular area. The object is also rectangular and has dimensions 0.07 x 0.07. I need to find 50 stable placements for this object on surface 0.
           
           Since the object is very small compared to the surface, and it's nearly square, I have a lot of flexibility in terms of position and orientation. I will try to place the object in various positions across the surface, and with a few different orientations (0 and pi/2 radians, since it's almost square).
           
           Surface 0: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))
           Object size_x: 0.07, size_y: 0.07
           
           For a placement (surf_idx, theta, x, y) to be stable:
           1. The object must be entirely contained within the surface's bounds.
           2. `x` and `y` represent the center of the object.
           
           If theta = 0 or pi (horizontal):
           `surf_lower_x + object_size_x / 2 <= x <= surf_upper_x - object_size_x / 2`
           `surf_lower_y + object_size_y / 2 <= y <= surf_upper_y - object_size_y / 2`
           
           If theta = pi/2 or 3pi/2 (vertical):
           `surf_lower_x + object_size_y / 2 <= x <= surf_upper_x - object_size_y / 2`
           `surf_lower_y + object_size_x / 2 <= y <= surf_upper_y - object_size_x / 2`
           
           Let's calculate the valid ranges for the center `x` and `y` for surface 0 and the object (0.07 x 0.07).
           
           For theta = 0 (object width 0.07, height 0.07):
           x_min = 4.2 + 0.07 / 2 = 4.2 + 0.035 = 4.235
           x_max = 4.8 - 0.07 / 2 = 4.8 - 0.035 = 4.765
           y_min = -0.6 + 0.07 / 2 = -0.6 + 0.035 = -0.565
           y_max = 0.0 - 0.07 / 2 = 0.0 - 0.035 = -0.035
           
           For theta = pi/2 (object width 0.07, height 0.07 - essentially the same as it's square):
           x_min = 4.2 + 0.07 / 2 = 4.235
           x_max = 4.8 - 0.07 / 2 = 4.765
           y_min = -0.6 + 0.07 / 2 = -0.565
           y_max = 0.0 - 0.07 / 2 = -0.035
           
           Since the object is square, the valid ranges for x and y are the same regardless of 0 or pi/2 rotation. I'll generate a grid of placements across the surface, varying x, y, and alternating theta between 0 and pi/2.
           
           Range for x: [4.235, 4.765] (length 0.53)
           Range for y: [-0.565, -0.035] (length 0.53)
           
           I can place roughly 7 objects along x (0.53 / 0.07 = ~7.5) and 7 objects along y. So roughly 49 positions. I will use a step of about 0.08 to ensure distinct positions.

Model:     The scene still contains surface 0: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           There are already successfully placed objects from the previous request. These were all objects of ID 5, with dimensions 0.07 x 0.07. The new object has ID 10 and dimensions 0.0936 x 0.0936.
           
           I need to find placements for object ID 10, avoiding collision with the previously placed objects of ID 5.
           
           Let's list the known placements for object ID 5:
           1. (0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565) - AABB: (4.2, -0.6), (4.27, -0.53)
           2. (0, 1.5707963267948966, 4.315, -0.565) - AABB: (4.28, -0.6), (4.35, -0.53) (approx, as it's square, the AABB is the same as unrotated, but centered at 4.315, -0.565)
           3. (0, 0.0, 4.395, -0.565) - AABB: (4.36, -0.6), (4.43, -0.53)
           4. (0, 1.5707963267948966, 4.475, -0.565) - AABB: (4.44, -0.6), (4.51, -0.53)
           5. (0, 0.0, 4.555, -0.565) - AABB: (4.52, -0.6), (4.59, -0.53)
           6. (0, 1.5707963267948966, 4.635, -0.565) - AABB: (4.60, -0.6), (4.67, -0.53)
           7. (0, 0.0, 4.715, -0.565) - AABB: (4.68, -0.6), (4.75, -0.53)
           These seven objects form a row along the bottom edge of surface 0, roughly from x=4.2 to x=4.75, with their y-centers at -0.565. Their bounding box extends from y=-0.6 to y=-0.53.
           
           8. (0, 1.5707963267948966, 4.235, -0.485) - AABB: (4.2, -0.52), (4.27, -0.45) (approx)
           9. (0, 0.0, 4.315, -0.485) - AABB: (4.28, -0.52), (4.35, -0.45) (approx)
           10. (0, 1.5707963267948966, 4.395, -0.485) - AABB: (4.36, -0.52), (4.43, -0.45) (approx)
           These three objects form the beginning of a second row, with their y-centers at -0.485. Their bounding box extends from y=-0.52 to y=-0.45.
           
           New object ID 10: size_x = 0.0936, size_y = 0.0936.
           Surface 0: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))
           
           Let's calculate the valid placement range for object ID 10 on surface 0, ignoring existing objects for a moment.
           Object size: 0.0936 x 0.0936 (square).
           Half-size: 0.0936 / 2 = 0.0468.
           
           For theta = 0 or pi/2:
           x_min = 4.2 + 0.0468 = 4.2468
           x_max = 4.8 - 0.0468 = 4.7532
           y_min = -0.6 + 0.0468 = -0.5532
           y_max = 0.0 - 0.0468 = -0.0468
           
           The objects ID 5 occupy the region:
           Row 1 (y-center -0.565): AABB roughly `((4.2, -0.6), (4.75, -0.53))`.
           Row 2 (y-center -0.485): AABB roughly `((4.2, -0.52), (4.43, -0.45))`.
           
           Since the new object is larger (0.0936) than the old object (0.07), its minimum required clearance from edges is also larger.
           The existing objects take up the lower part of the surface.
           The first row of objects (ID 5) occupies from y=-0.6 to y=-0.53.
           The new object's minimum y-center is -0.5532, and it extends 0.0468 below that, so its lowest point would be -0.6. This means the new object cannot be placed with its bottom edge at y=-0.6 directly adjacent to the first row of ID 5 objects.
           
           Let's try to place it in the upper part of the surface, away from the existing objects.
           A safe bet is to aim for y values much higher than -0.45.
           Let's try a y-center around -0.1.
           
           Let's try to create a grid of placements for object ID 10 in the available space.
           The x-range for object ID 10 is [4.2468, 4.7532].
           The y-range for object ID 10 is [-0.5532, -0.0468].
           
           The existing objects occupy:
           - Row 1: y-center -0.565, AABB y-range [-0.6, -0.53].
           - Row 2 (partial): y-center -0.485, AABB y-range [-0.52, -0.45].
           
           So, the area y < -0.45 is mostly occupied.
           Let's focus on y > -0.45 for object ID 10.
           The new y_min for object ID 10 would be -0.45 + 0.0936/2 (if tangent to ID 5 object top, roughly -0.45 + 0.0468 = -0.4032).
           So, let's start y-centers from around -0.4.
           
           I will iterate through x-values from 4.2468 to 4.7532 and y-values from about -0.4 to -0.0468, alternating orientations.
           Step for x/y: I need to leave a gap for objects ID 5 if I place object 10 near them. Since object 10 is larger, and I want to place 50, I will use a step of 0.1 to cover the surface.
           
           Let's define the AABBs for the existing objects more precisely for collision checking:
           ID 5 (0.07x0.07)
           1. (0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565) -> AABB_5_1: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.27, -0.53))
           2. (0, 1.57, 4.315, -0.565) -> AABB_5_2: ((4.28, -0.6), (4.35, -0.53))
           3. (0, 0.0, 4.395, -0.565) -> AABB_5_3: ((4.36, -0.6), (4.43, -0.53))
           4. (0, 1.57, 4.475, -0.565) -> AABB_5_4: ((4.44, -0.6), (4.51, -0.53))
           5. (0, 0.0, 4.555, -0.565) -> AABB_5_5: ((4.52, -0.6), (4.59, -0.53))
           6. (0, 1.57, 4.635, -0.565) -> AABB_5_6: ((4.60, -0.6), (4.67, -0.53))
           7. (0, 0.0, 4.715, -0.565) -> AABB_5_7: ((4.68, -0.6), (4.75, -0.53))
           8. (0, 1.57, 4.235, -0.485) -> AABB_5_8: ((4.2, -0.52), (4.27, -0.45))
           9. (0, 0.0, 4.315, -0.485) -> AABB_5_9: ((4.28, -0.52), (4.35, -0.45))
           10. (0, 1.57, 4.395, -0.485) -> AABB_5_10: ((4.36, -0.52), (4.43, -0.45))
           
           Let's generate placements for object ID 10, considering a general AABB for object 10 at (x_10, y_10) with size (0.0936, 0.0936).
           AABB_10: ((x_10 - 0.0468, y_10 - 0.0468), (x_10 + 0.0468, y_10 + 0.0468)).
           
           Collision check:
           Given an AABB A = ((Ax1, Ay1), (Ax2, Ay2)) and B = ((Bx1, By1), (Bx2, By2)), they collide if:
           Ax1 < Bx2 AND Ax2 > Bx1 AND Ay1 < By2 AND Ay2 > By1.
           
           I will start placing object ID 10 higher up in the y-range to avoid collisions and then work my way down.
           Try y_center = -0.1. AABB_10_y: [-0.1468, -0.0532]. This range does not overlap with any existing ID 5 objects.
           So, any x between 4.2468 and 4.7532 and y = -0.1 is safe for object 10.
           Let's make sure the y_max -0.0468 is used for the object center, so the top is at y = 0 - 0.0468 = -0.0468.
           So the highest y-center is -0.0468. Let's start with y = -0.05.
           Then iterate downwards.
           
           Let's define a safe starting y-center: -0.05.
           Max x-center for object 10: 4.7532.
           Min x-center for object 10: 4.2468.
           Step size for x and y: 0.1 for initial positions, then adjust.
           
           X values: 4.25, 4.35, 4.45, 4.55, 4.65, 4.75 (6 values)
           Y values: -0.05, -0.15, -0.25, -0.35 (4 values, 24 positions). Then go lower.
           
           First batch: y from -0.05 down to -0.35. All these are above the existing ID 5 objects, so no collision check needed yet.

           This is 24 placements. Let's try y = -0.45.
           AABB_10_y: [-0.4968, -0.4032]. This range starts to overlap with Row 2 of ID 5 objects (AABB y-range [-0.52, -0.45]) and is close to Row 1 of ID 5 objects (AABB y-range [-0.6, -0.53]).
           
           Let's check for collision for placements at y = -0.45 with the existing ID 5 objects.
           Proposed AABB_10 at y=-0.45: ((x - 0.0468, -0.4968), (x + 0.0468, -0.4032))
           
           Collision with AABB_5_8: ((4.2, -0.52), (4.27, -0.45))
           If proposed x = 4.25: AABB_10_4.25 = ((4.2032, -0.4968), (4.2968, -0.4032))
           This collides with AABB_5_8 because 4.2032 < 4.27 and 4.2968 > 4.2. Also -0.4968 < -0.45 and -0.4032 > -0.52.
           
           Collision with AABB_5_9: ((4.28, -0.52), (4.35, -0.45))
           If proposed x = 4.35: AABB_10_4.35 = ((4.3032, -0.4968), (4.3968, -0.4032))
           This collides with AABB_5_9.
           
           Collision with AABB_5_10: ((4.36, -0.52), (4.43, -0.45))
           If proposed x = 4.45: AABB_10_4.45 = ((4.4032, -0.4968), (4.4968, -0.4032))
           This collides with AABB_5_10.
           
           It looks like the initial values for x (4.25, 4.35, 4.45) at y = -0.45 will collide with the second row of ID 5 objects.
           So, for y = -0.45, I should only place object 10 where the x-range does not overlap with AABB_5_8, AABB_5_9, AABB_5_10.
           This means x should be > 4.43 + 0.0468 = 4.4768 for the left edge. So x_center > 4.4768.
           So, x=4.55, x=4.65, x=4.75 seem safe for y=-0.45.
           
           Let's try y = -0.5.
           Proposed AABB_10 at y=-0.5: ((x - 0.0468, -0.5468), (x + 0.0468, -0.4532))
           This y-range overlaps with Row 1 of ID 5 objects (AABB y-range [-0.6, -0.53]) and Row 2 (AABB y-range [-0.52, -0.45]).
           So, a collision check is necessary for all existing ID 5 objects for y = -0.5.
           The space is getting very constrained at y=-0.5. It's likely only small gaps, if any, are available.
           Let's re-evaluate the free space.
           
           Surface area: 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36
           Object 5 area: 0.07 * 0.07 = 0.0049. Ten objects of ID 5 = 0.049.
           Object 10 area: 0.0936 * 0.0936 = 0.00876.
           We need to find 50 placements for object 10. That's 50 * 0.00876 = 0.438 area. This is more than the surface area. This means I need to make sure I'm generating placements correctly and finding available spaces. If the total area of 50 objects of ID 10 exceeds the surface area, it's not possible. Oh, I misunderstood the prompt. I need to return *50 stable placements*, not place *50 objects*. I am placing one object, ID 10, 50 times in different locations.
           
           My previous strategy of filling the upper part of the surface is good.
           We have 24 placements already. Let's continue filling the remaining space (4.2468, 4.7532) x (-0.5532, -0.0468) avoiding the known occupied areas.
           
           The free space is roughly:
           - `y > -0.45`:
             - `x` from `4.2468` to `4.7532`. This is a large free rectangle.
           - `y < -0.45` but `y > -0.53` (i.e. between row 1 and row 2 of object ID 5):
             - No, row 2 max y is -0.45. Row 1 max y is -0.53.
             - The gap between row 1 and row 2 is `[-0.53, -0.45]`.
             - Object 10 AABB for y-center `y_c`: `[y_c - 0.0468, y_c + 0.0468]`.
             - To fit between these rows, `y_c - 0.0468` must be >= -0.53 and `y_c + 0.0468` must be <= -0.45.
             - So, `y_c >= -0.53 + 0.0468 = -0.4832`
             - And `y_c <= -0.45 - 0.0468 = -0.4968`
             - This interval is `[-0.4832, -0.4968]`. This is an invalid interval since -0.4832 > -0.4968.
             - This means an object of size 0.0936 cannot fit in the vertical gap between the rows of ID 5 objects (0.07 height).
             - The gap width is `(-0.45) - (-0.53) = 0.08`. The object height is `0.0936`. So it cannot fit.
           
           Therefore, any placement for object ID 10 with a y-center between -0.53+0.0468 = -0.4832 and -0.45-0.0468 = -0.4968 (which simplifies to trying to put its AABB into `[-0.53, -0.45]`) will collide.
           The object ID 10 has to be either completely above y = -0.45 (so y_center + 0.0468 < -0.45, i.e., y_center < -0.4968, or effectively the placements I've already tried) OR it has to be completely below y = -0.53 (so y_center - 0.0468 > -0.53, i.e., y_center > -0.4832). This confirms that a vertical gap does not exist for this object.
           
           So, I need to place object ID 10 either:
           1. With its bottom above y = -0.45. This means y_center >= -0.45 + 0.0468 = -0.4032.
           2. With its top below y = -0.53. This means y_center <= -0.53 - 0.0468 = -0.5768.
           
           Let's focus on option 1 first, covering the area `y_center` from `-0.0468` down to `-0.4032`.
           My generated positions so far:
           y = -0.05, -0.15, -0.25, -0.35. These all have y_center + 0.0468 = -0.0032, -0.1032, -0.2032, -0.3032 respectively, which is greater than -0.4032. So these are all safe vertically from existing ID 5 objects.
           
           Let's refine the x-range for y = -0.45 or lower, to avoid the existing objects horizontally.
           Row 2 of ID 5 objects: occupies x-range `[4.2, 4.43]` for y-range `[-0.52, -0.45]`.
           So for `y_center` corresponding to an AABB overlapping this region (i.e. `y_center < -0.4032`), we must avoid `x` values that would cause horizontal overlap.
           Specifically, if `y_center` results in AABB `y_bottom < -0.45`, then any `x_center` which results in AABB `x_left < 4.43` and `x_right > 4.2` will collide with the first three ID 5 objects in row 2.
           This means for the region where y_center is from -0.4032 down to -0.4968 (which is the boundary of the 'no fit' zone for object ID 10 height), we must avoid the x region `[4.2, 4.43]`.
           So, if `y_center` is in `[-0.4032, -0.4968]` (invalid range, should be `[-0.4968, -0.4032]`), then `x_center` should be `> 4.43 + 0.0468 = 4.4768`.
           
           Let's pick `y_center = -0.40`. AABB_10_y: `[-0.4468, -0.3532]`.
           This is above the entire Row 2 of ID 5 objects (max y = -0.45). So `y=-0.40` is completely free vertically.
           So I can use all x values for `y = -0.40`:
           (0, 0.0, 4.25, -0.40)
           (0, 1.5707963267948966, 4.35, -0.40)
           (0, 0.0, 4.45, -0.40)
           (0, 1.5707963267948966, 4.55, -0.40)
           (0, 0.0, 4.65, -0.40)
           (0, 1.5707963267948966, 4.75, -0.40)
           
           Now let's consider option 2: `y_center <= -0.5768`.
           The lowest y_center is -0.5532. This is above -0.5768.
           This means that object 10 cannot be placed with its top below y=-0.53 without colliding with the bottom edge of surface 0.
           
           Let's recheck the logic for a gap between rows of ID 5.
           Row 1 objects occupy `y in [-0.6, -0.53]`.
           Row 2 objects occupy `y in [-0.52, -0.45]`.
           This means there is no vertical gap at all. The highest point of row 1 is -0.53. The lowest point of row 2 is -0.52.
           So `[-0.53, -0.52]` is the largest vertical "gap" between the two rows of objects. This is a height of 0.01.
           Object ID 10 has a height of 0.0936. So it cannot fit in this space.
           
           This simplifies the problem: object ID 10 can only be placed *above* all existing ID 5 objects, or *below* all existing ID 5 objects (but below them means colliding with surface 0 lower bound), or in the unoccupied x-range of the surface.
           
           The combined AABB of the existing objects ID 5 is complex.
           However, a simpler approach is to identify the overall bounding box of all existing objects.
           Rough AABB of all ID 5 objects:
           Min x = 4.2 (from 4.235 - 0.035)
           Max x = 4.75 (from 4.715 + 0.035)
           Min y = -0.6 (from -0.565 - 0.035)
           Max y = -0.45 (from -0.485 + 0.035)
           
           So the region `[4.2, 4.75] x [-0.6, -0.45]` is mostly occupied.
           Object ID 10 has width/height 0.0936. Half width/height 0.0468.
           It must fit inside `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))` without its AABB overlapping `[4.2, 4.75] x [-0.6, -0.45]`.
           
           This means for object ID 10:
           1. `y_center + 0.0468 <= -0.45` (i.e., `y_center <= -0.4968`)
              - In this case, `x_center` should be such that `x_center - 0.0468 >= 4.75` (i.e. to the right of the existing block). `x_center >= 4.7968`. This is outside the surface x_max (4.8 - 0.0468 = 4.7532). So no fit here.
              - OR `x_center + 0.0468 <= 4.2` (i.e. to the left of the existing block). `x_center <= 4.1532`. This is outside the surface x_min (4.2 + 0.0468 = 4.2468). So no fit here either.
           
           2. `y_center - 0.0468 >= -0.45` (i.e., `y_center >= -0.4032`).
              - This places the object *above* the existing ID 5 objects. This is the main free region.
              - For these placements, the x-range is `[4.2468, 4.7532]` and the y-range is `[-0.4032, -0.0468]`. This is the most suitable region.
           
           Let's generate 50 placements in this region:
           x from 4.2468 to 4.7532 (length ~0.5)
           y from -0.4032 to -0.0468 (length ~0.35)
           
           Using a step of 0.08 for both x and y.
           X values: 4.25, 4.33, 4.41, 4.49, 4.57, 4.65, 4.73 (7 values)
           Y values: -0.05, -0.13, -0.21, -0.29, -0.37 (5 values)
           Total 7 * 5 = 35 positions. I'll alternate theta. This is enough for 35 unique positions. I need 50. I can add more values.
           
           Let's try:
           X values: 4.25, 4.30, 4.35, 4.40, 4.45, 4.50, 4.55, 4.60, 4.65, 4.70, 4.75 (11 values)
           Y values: -0.05, -0.10, -0.15, -0.20, -0.25, -0.30, -0.35, -0.40 (8 values)
           This gives 11 * 8 = 88 positions. I can pick 50 from these.
