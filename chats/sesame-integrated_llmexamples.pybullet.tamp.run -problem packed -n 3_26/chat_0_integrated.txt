User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.118, -0.409), (0.195, -0.332)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.154, -0.259), (0.237, -0.176)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.156, -0.288), (-0.057, -0.189)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.157, -0.37, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.052, 0.999).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.195, -0.217, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.774, 0.633).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.106, -0.238, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.39, 0.921).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

Model:     The scene contains three graspable objects: v8, v12, and v14. They are currently located on object v11. The goal is to place all three objects on object v16. Since all objects start on v11, and the robot is at v3, the robot needs to pick each object, one by one, and place it on v16. Since object v16 is a dummy surface, the objects can be placed on object v11 instead.

Since object v16 is a dummy surface, the objects can be placed on object v11 instead. The previous plan failed because it tried to pick objects at '#o3' (a base configuration) which was not the robot's current configuration, v3. The plan needs to first move to the correct base configuration if it's not at v3. However, since the kin facts are defined for #o3, the robot needs to move to #o3.

Since all objects start on v11, and the robot is at v3, the robot needs to pick each object, one by one, and place it on v16. The previous plan failed because it tried to place objects at '#o2' on v11, but the goal states that the objects should be supported by v16. Since v16 is a dummy surface, we can place them on v11, but the `supported` predicate in the initial state must be respected. In the initial state we have `supported(v8, #o2, v16)`, `supported(v12, #o2, v16)` and `supported(v14, #o2, v16)`. So we will place the objects using the provided #o2 pose which is specified to be supported by v16, and provide the continuous value for #o2 as being on v11.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable objects: v8, v12, and v14. They are currently located on object v11. The goal is to place all three objects on object v16. Since all objects start on v11, and the robot is at v3, the robot needs to pick each object, one by one, and place it on v16. The error indicated that `supported(v14, #o2, v16)` was not satisfied, which means the previous assignment of `#o2` for all objects on `v11` was incorrect given the predicates in the initial state. The initial state has `supported(v8, #o2, v16)`, `supported(v12, #o2, v16)`, and `supported(v14, #o2, v16)`. Since v16 is a dummy surface and the goal is to put objects `on(object, v16)`, we need to place them on an available surface whose continuous value has already been provided, such as v11. So we will assign separate `#o2` poses for each object that are on v11 to satisfy the `supported` predicate and the goal of `on(object, v16)`. This means we need three distinct #o2 poses for each object, even though they share the same name #o2 in the PDDL. Since this cannot be represented in the current format where a single continuous value is given for #o2, and the initial state only provides `pose(v8, #o2)`, `pose(v12, #o2)`, and `pose(v14, #o2)` with `supported(obj, #o2, v16)`, the most straightforward interpretation is to place them on v11 using a single pose name #o2, and provide a different value for each object for that #o2. The previous plan already did that. The problem could be from the `stackable` predicate. There are `stackable(v8, v16)`, `stackable(v12, v16)`, `stackable(v14, v16)`. Thus, placing them on v16 is allowed. The plan should be valid. Let me try to adjust the `kin` and `basemotion` facts more carefully based on the provided initial state. The given `kin` facts are `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`, `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`, `kin(v4, v14, v15, #o1, #o3, #o4)`, `kin(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)`, `kin(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`, `kin(v4, v14, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`. All these kin facts require the base configuration `#o3`. Therefore, the first step must be to move the base from `v3` to `#o3`. The `basemotion` facts available are `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)` and `basemotion(#o3, #o0, v3)` and `basemotion(#o3, #o0, #o3)` and `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)`. The plan should be:

Model:     The problem persists with the `supported` predicate for `#o2`. Even though `supported(v8, #o2, v16)` is given in the initial state, the system seems to be evaluating the *provided continuous value* for `#o2` against the `v16` object's AABB. Since `v16` is a dummy surface, and I'm providing a pose on `v11`, the system thinks `supported(v8, #o2, v16)` is false.
           
           To rectify this, I must choose a surface in the `supported` predicate that actually has a provided continuous value in the initial state. In this case, `v11` has a known AABB. The initial state mentions:
           `supported(v8, v9, v11)`
           `supported(v12, v13, v11)`
           `supported(v14, v15, v11)`
           
           And the goal is `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, `on(v14, v16)`. Since `v16` is a dummy surface, and the `supported` predicate requires a concrete surface for the continuous value, I should use `v11` for the actual placement in the continuous values. However, the problem statement says "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `pose(obj, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `obj`, then you must provide a continuous value for the pose such that, given the geometry of the scene, the pose is a collision-free stable placement for the object on a surface for which `supported(obj, #<name> surf)` is in the initial state." And "If the plan requires multiple different objects to be placed simultaneously at the same pose starting with '#', then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* object at that pose (not one that works for all), specifying the pose name, object name, and surface name."
           
           The critical point is "If the plan you select uses a pose that does not begin with '#', then you need not provide a value for it, as one already exists." Here, the goal is `on(v8, v16)`, which implies `supported(v8, p_goal, v16)` and `atpose(v8, p_goal)`. Since `v16` is a dummy surface, and we have `supported(v8, #o2, v16)` in the initial state, I must provide a pose for `#o2` that is on `v11`. The issue is likely that the system is trying to verify `supported(v8, #o2, v16)` using the provided pose on `v11`, and it's failing because the surface `v16` doesn't match the provided surface `v11` for the continuous value.
           
           The instructions also state: "If a pose starting with '#' for which `pose(obj, #<name>)` is in the initial state is used in your plan, please also provide a continuous value for it, specifying the pose name, object name, and surface name." And "If the continuous value for a surface is not provided, then it is a dummy surface. When placing objects supported at dummy surfaces, choose any other surface whose continuous value is provided and provide a placement on that surface." This is exactly what I'm trying to do.
           
           The `supported` facts in the initial state are:
           `supported(v8, v9, v11)`
           `supported(v12, v13, v11)`
           `supported(v14, v15, v11)`
           `supported(v8, #o2, v16)`
           `supported(v14, #o2, v10)`
           `supported(v14, #o2, v16)`
           `supported(v12, #o2, v16)`
           `supported(v12, #o2, v10)`
           `supported(v8, #o2, v10)`
           
           This means that `#o2` can be a pose on `v16` (dummy) or `v10` (no AABB provided, so also dummy). To satisfy the `supported` precondition `supported(v8, #o2, v16)`, I must provide a continuous value for `#o2` that is on an actual surface, such as `v11`, *while still specifying `v16` as the intended surface in the pose output*. This is a tricky interpretation, but it seems to be what the system expects.
           
           The AABB for `v11` is `((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6))`. I'll place the objects on `v11` but declare them as supported by `v16` in the output, as per the initial state.

Model:     My apologies. The issue is that while `v16` is a dummy surface, it *does* have a defined AABB `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. My previous placements were on `v11` (which has a larger AABB) but I specified `v16` as the surface in the output. This is a contradiction. When the system checks `supported(obj, #o2, v16)`, it's now using `v16`'s AABB for stability checks, and my coordinates were outside it.
           
           I need to place the objects within the bounds of `v16`'s AABB. Since `v16` is a dummy surface, it doesn't represent a physical table but is merely a conceptual location. However, the stability check will still apply to its provided AABB.
           
           Let's find suitable coordinates within `v16`'s AABB `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. The objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14` are relatively small. I will try to place them close to the center of `v16`.
           
           Object `v8` has AABB `((0.118, -0.409), (0.195, -0.332))` (This is the object's initial AABB, not its actual size, the continuous values for poses are for `graspable` objects and they are usually small). The object's actual AABB for `v8` is usually like `(minx, miny), (maxx, maxy)` where `maxx-minx` and `maxy-miny` are small, e.g. 0.077 and 0.077 (for circular objects of radius 0.035). Let's use smaller objects like plates or cups and place them close to each other, but not overlapping.
           
           Let's assume the objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14` have small circular base, say radius 0.035.
           The center of `v16` is (0, 0).
           I'll place `v8` at (0.05, 0.05), `v12` at (-0.05, 0.05), `v14` at (0.05, -0.05) relative to the center of `v16`.
           The height of objects on a surface is typically 0.781.
