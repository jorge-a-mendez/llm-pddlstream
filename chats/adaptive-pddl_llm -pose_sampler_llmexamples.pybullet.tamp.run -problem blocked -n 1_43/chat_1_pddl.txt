           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes several objects and their properties. We have three stackable and graspable objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v15`. `v8` is currently at pose `v9` and supported by `v11`. `v12` is at pose `v13` and supported by `v14`. `v15` is at pose `v16` and supported by `v11`. All three objects can be supported by `v10` and `v18` at various poses (including `#o2`). `v8` and `v12` are of type `v17`. There are two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both are handempty. The robot is at base configuration `v3` and arm `v4` is at configuration `v5` while arm `v6` is at `v7`. The `canmove()` predicate is true.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` is defined as `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. In the context of the given initial state, `v8` and `v12` are of type `v17`. Therefore, to achieve the goal, we need to place either `v8` or `v12` on `v18`. Since `v12` is already at `v13` and `v14` (which is not `v18`), and `v8` is at `v9` and `v11` (also not `v18`), we need to pick up one of them and place it on `v18`.
           
           Let's choose `v8` as the object to move.
           1. The robot's arm `v4` needs to pick up `v8` from `v9`. The action `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)` is available.
               - Preconditions for pick:
                   - `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`: True (given).
                   - `atpose(v8, v9)`: True (given).
                   - `handempty(v4)`: True (given).
                   - `atbconf(#o3)`: This is `bconf(#o3)` is given, but `atbconf(#o3)` is not. We only have `atbconf(v3)`. So, the robot would need to move to `#o3` first, if `#o3` is different from `v3`. However, we only have one `move_base` action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which doesn't change the base configuration. If `#o3` is `v3`, then `atbconf(v3)` is true. Let's assume `#o3` can be resolved to `v3`.
                   - `NegatedAtom unsafeapproach(v8, v9, #o1)`: No facts given to make this true. Assume false.
                   - `NegatedAtom unsafeatraj(#o4)`: No facts given to make this true. Assume false.
               - Effects of pick: `atgrasp(v4, v8, #o1)`, `canmove()`, `NegatedAtom atpose(v8, v9)`, `NegatedAtom handempty(v4)`.
           
           2. After picking, `v4` needs to place `v8` on `v18` at a new pose, say `#o2`. The action `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` is available.
               - Preconditions for place:
                   - `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`: True (given).
                   - `atgrasp(v4, v8, #o1)`: Achieved by pick.
                   - `atbconf(#o3)`: Again, assume `#o3` resolves to `v3`.
                   - `NegatedAtom unsafepose(v8, #o2)`: No facts given to make this true. Assume false.
                   - `NegatedAtom unsafeapproach(v8, #o2, #o1)`: No facts given to make this true. Assume false.
                   - `NegatedAtom unsafeatraj(#o4)`: No facts given to make this true. Assume false.
               - Effects of place: `atpose(v8, #o2)`, `handempty(v4)`, `canmove()`, `NegatedAtom atgrasp(v4, v8, #o1)`.
               - We also need `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` to be true, which is given as an initial fact.
           
           With `atpose(v8, #o2)` and `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`, the axiom `on(v8, v18)` becomes true. Since `type(v8, v17)` is also true, the goal `new-axiom@0()` (which expands to `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`) will be satisfied by `v8`.
           
           The only available `move_base` action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which means the robot doesn't move its base. This is consistent with our assumption that `#o3` resolves to `v3`.
           
           --Plan--:
           (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4)
           (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The previous plan included `pick` and `place` actions which are not in the list of valid action instances. The only valid action instance provided is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.
           
           This `move_base` action does not change the robot's base configuration (`v3` to `v3`) and does not involve any manipulation of objects. The goal `new-axiom@0()`, which requires an object of type `v17` to be on `v18`, cannot be achieved without manipulating objects (i.e., picking and placing them). Since no `pick` or `place` actions are allowed, and no object is initially on `v18` and of type `v17` (checking axioms and initial state: `on(?o: object, ?r: object)` means `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`. We need `supported(?o, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)` and `type(?o, v17)`. From the initial state: `v8` is `type(v8, v17)` but `supported(v8, v9, v11)`. `v12` is `type(v12, v17)` but `supported(v12, v13, v14)`. Neither is on `v18`. Therefore, the goal is unreachable with the given allowed actions.
