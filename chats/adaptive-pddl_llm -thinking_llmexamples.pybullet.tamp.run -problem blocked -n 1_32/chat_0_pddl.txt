           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)

           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My objective is to devise a plan to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to the conjunction of `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.  I've already identified that both `v8` and `v12` satisfy `type(?green, v17)`.  Now, I need to evaluate if I can make either object be "on" `v18`.
           
           The definition of `on(?o, ?r)` depends on `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`.  I can see that both `v8` and `v12` are *supported* by `v18` already. Thus I need the *atpose* condition to be met to make either statement *true*. The supporting condition would then make *on* be true. Currently, they are *atpose* in different places.
           
           Reviewing the initial state, I see that the only allowed action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. However, this `move_base` action doesn't allow any object to move. *pick* and *place* actions are not available instances in the set of given valid actions.
           
           Since I can't directly manipulate the positions of `v8` or `v12` with the available actions, and no other state or object in the initial state helps to achieve the goal, I conclude that the `new-axiom@0()` goal is currently unreachable given the single allowed `move_base` action.
