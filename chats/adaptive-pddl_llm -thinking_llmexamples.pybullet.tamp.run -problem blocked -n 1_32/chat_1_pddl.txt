           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Atom kin(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachability Analysis**
           
           My objective is to fulfill the goal `on(?green, v18) ∧ type(?green, v17)`.  I've identified that objects `v8` and `v12` satisfy `type(?green, v17)`. However, neither is currently `on(v18)`.
           
           My strategy, therefore, needs to involve moving either `v8` or `v12` onto `v18`.  This would require a `pick` and `place` action sequence.  Unfortunately, the initial state provides only one action instance: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This severely limits my options, as I cannot directly pick up and place objects with this action.
           
           The `pick` and `place` actions each have a precondition `atbconf(?q)`, where `?q` represents a base configuration. The `kin` facts indicate that the base configuration needed for my relevant kinematics is `#o3`. However, the initial state only provides `atbconf(v3)` and `bconf(#o3)`. I have no way to move the robot's base from `v3` to `#o3` with the single provided action instance, `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.
           
           Without the ability to reach the required base configuration `#o3`, I cannot execute `pick` or `place`.  Because I cannot manipulate any objects, I cannot satisfy the goal of placing an object of the correct type on `v18`. The goal is therefore unreachable.  The given constraints, specifically the limited action instances and the requirement to use only those provided, make this conclusion inescapable.
