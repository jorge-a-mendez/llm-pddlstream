(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Object Placement**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 4) on a square surface.  The surface is centered at (0,0) and extends from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  The object is also a square, with side length 0.0717.
           
           The key to stability is ensuring the object is *fully contained* within the surface boundaries.  Since both the object and surface are squares, rotating the object won't change its bounding box size as long as rotations are multiples of pi/2. However, I need to account for rotations in my calculations and ensure the largest rotated bounding box is still within the surface.
           
           I'll calculate the maximum effective width/height of the object considering rotations. The formula for the effective width/height of the object with a rotation is:  `side_len * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. The largest is `obj_side * sqrt(2)`, which translates to 0.1014. Since the surface is 0.270 on each side, this rotated object will fit. Therefore, I can rotate at any angle and still be okay.
           
           To maximize coverage, I’ll vary both rotation (theta) and center position (x, y). To ensure I satisfy the requirement for 50 placements, I'll use 5 different `theta` values: `0`, `pi/8`, `pi/4`, `3pi/8`, `pi/2`.  For each rotation, I'll generate approximately 10 (x,y) positions.
           
           The valid range for the object's center will shrink as `theta` increases towards pi/4 or 3pi/4. The formula for center limit is `[-0.135 + object_effective_side / 2, 0.135 - object_effective_side / 2]`, I'll compute this, for each chosen `theta`.
           
           Here is the plan to place 50 stable placements of Object 4 on Surface 0:
           *   **0 radians Rotation:** The range of valid centers (-0.0991, 0.0991). I'll use values in `x` and `y` from this range, and also one extra.
           *   **pi/8 radians Rotation:** Reduced center range (-0.0881, 0.0881).
           *   **pi/4 radians Rotation:** The range will shrink further (-0.0843, 0.0843).
           *   **3pi/8 radians Rotation:** Again, -0.0881 to 0.0881.
           *   **pi/2 radians Rotation:** The full range again (-0.0991, 0.0991)
           
           And using that plan, I generated the placements listed below.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've received feedback about the placement of Object 4, which is now at a specific location on Surface 0. I *must* consider this placement when determining where to put Object 6 to avoid any collisions.
           
           The input tells me Object 6 has extents of roughly `0.0969` units. Essentially, it's a square. I'll need to calculate the *effective* size of Object 6 for different rotations (`0.0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2`) because the rotation will change its effective width and height.
           
           I need to figure out where Object 6 can go without bumping into Object 4. First, let's analyze the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of Object 4, which is currently in the bottom-left corner of the surface. Its AABB is `((-0.135, -0.135), (-0.06328..., -0.06328...))`. Object 6 has a dimension of ~0.097
           
           To avoid collisions I'll define a function that does AABB intersection (checking that their (x, y) coordinates' AABB overlap.
           `obj6_aabb_min_x < obj4_max_x` AND `obj6_aabb_max_x > obj4_min_x` AND
           `obj6_aabb_min_y < obj4_max_y` AND `obj6_aabb_max_y > obj4_min_y`
           The strategy is:
           *   First, generate a grid of potential `(x, y)` center locations on the surface for object 6, taking into account the rotation and object sizes.
           *   Then, for each possible placement (x,y) and each rotation (`0.0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2`), calculate Object 6's AABB.
           *   Use `is_collision` to check for collisions against Object 4 by performing AABB calculations and comparing them against the established placement of Object 4.  If there's no collision, the current (`theta, x, y`) is valid.
           *   Repeat until I've found at least 50 valid, collision-free placements. The generated coordinate ranges will ensure placements are entirely within surface bounds.
           I'll create the `is_collision` function. It is based on a well established standard formula of comparing the max and min values of each axis (x, y).
           
           I'm confident this method is correct and efficient.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object 5 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 5) on Surface 0, which is a square region of size 0.270 x 0.270.  I need to consider two existing square objects, ID 4 and ID 6, as obstacles.
           
           Here's my plan:
           
           1.  **AABB Calculations and Constraints:**  I've already determined the bounding boxes (AABB) for the obstacles. Object 4 is located in the bottom-left, Object 6 in the top-left of the surface.  I've also worked out the maximum and minimum center positions for object 5 based on its varying effective size as it's rotated. The effective size of Object 5 changes with its rotation because of its square shape. I've calculated the valid center ranges considering rotations of 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, and pi/2.
           
           2.  **Grid-Based Sampling:** I'll establish a grid within the surface boundaries for each of the five rotation angles.  Within each valid range, I'll place a 7x7 grid of candidate center points. These should be evenly spaced.
           
           3.  **Collision Detection:** For each candidate position (x, y, theta), I'll calculate the AABB of Object 5. I've set up a fast AABB intersection test using the calculated AABB coordinates. If the bounding box of the Object 5 placement overlaps with any of the two obstacles, I'll discard the placement.
           
           4.  **Priority and Placement Count:** I want a set of diverse solutions. I will continue placing candidate objects until I have a set of 50 non-colliding positions.
