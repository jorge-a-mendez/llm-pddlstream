User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object

           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.13, -0.39), (0.202, -0.318)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.159, -0.576), (0.254, -0.481)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.006, -0.555), (0.096, -0.465)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.166, -0.354, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.017, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.195, 0.194), (-0.11, 0.279)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.206, -0.528, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.969, -0.247).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.051, -0.51, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.984, 0.176).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.152, 0.236, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.622, 0.783).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Summary of Plan Generation**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've got a clear goal: get these four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) onto that v18 object. They're all sitting on v11 right now, with their own specific positions. The `on` predicate is my key here, meaning I need each object to be both supported and at the right pose relative to v18.
           
           Based on the initial state, v18 *can* support those objects – that's a good start. Also, I need to place each object using the arm `v4`. I noticed some `kin` predicates that look promising, specifically they relate to `v18`. Those `kin` entries use  `#o2` as the position on `v18`. However, since I'm placing multiple objects at the "same" pose `#o2`, I need to use a distinct, individual `#o2` for each object. I'll make a dedicated `#o2` for each object's placement.
           
           No base movement seems necessary. I'll need to use some `pick` and `place` actions in a sequence. I'll need to figure out where the arm and base can go from the initial state to pick up and place the objects. My main concerns in building the plan will be: are these actions safe? Is the final pose collision free? Are all the preconditions met?
           
           I've examined the pick and place preconditions. From the available actions, I can pick any of the four objects using arm `v4`. I will need a common grasp (`#o1`) and arm trajectory (#o4), and my base should remain at configuration `v3`. For the safety checks, I am going to assume that the `kin` relations provided imply that the planned movements and poses are collision-free.
           
           Since the space on v18 is limited, I calculated new target positions on v18 that won't cause collisions. I want a 2x2 grid, where each object is centered on this region:
           *   `#o2_v8`: (-0.09, -0.09, 0.781, 0) for v8
           *   `#o2_v12`: (-0.0875, 0.0875, 0.781, 0) for v12
           *   `#o2_v14`: (-0.009, -0.09, 0.781, 0) for v14
           *   `#o2_v16`: (0.0025, 0.0875, 0.781, 0) for v16
           
           My plan will be a straightforward sequence:
           1.  Pick v8 from v9 and place at `#o2_v8`.
           2.  Pick v12 from v13 and place at `#o2_v12`.
           3.  Pick v14 from v15 and place at `#o2_v14`.
           4.  Pick v16 from v17 and place at `#o2_v16`.
           
           All the pieces seem to fit together based on what I see in the problem. The total cost will be 8 (4 picks + 4 places). Now I just need to translate this into the required output format.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Action Limitations**
           
           Okay, so the user's plan is a non-starter. They're trying to use actions that aren't on the approved list. Looking at the list, it's just `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  That's... well, it's pretty useless for the goal at hand.  It's just moving the base, but keeping it in the *same* configuration, *v3* to *v3*!  The trajectory identifier, *#o0*, is just along for the ride.
           
           The overarching objective is clear: get those four vertices - *v8*, *v12*, *v14*, and *v16* - onto *v18*.  That screams `pick` and `place` operations to me. We're manipulating objects. We're picking them up and putting them down, but those fundamental actions aren't allowed.  
           
           Since `pick` and `place` are necessary for this kind of manipulation and they're absent from the action list, there's no way to reach the goal with these constraints. It's simply not possible given the permitted actions. The plan's invalid because the actions we need aren't available.
