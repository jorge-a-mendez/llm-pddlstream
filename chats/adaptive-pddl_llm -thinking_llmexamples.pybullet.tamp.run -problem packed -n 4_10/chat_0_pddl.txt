               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Impossibility Proof for Achieving the Goal**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan to arrange four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) on object v18. Initially, these objects are on v11. To achieve this, I need to use the `on` axiom, which requires `supported(?o, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`.  I see that all four objects *could* be supported by `v18`. This suggests a standard pick-and-place strategy for each. However, the available action instances severely constrain the possible solutions.
           
           The initial state provides all the necessary facts such as `atpose(v8,v9)`, `supported(v8, v9, v11)`, `graspable(v8)`, etc. for picking each object, where the `grasp` will be instantiated as `#o1` and the `pose` will be `#o2` on v18.
           
           This would be a standard problem! I'd generate the  pick/place sequence for each object. For example I would calculate
           `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #t_pick_v8)` for grasping.
           and `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #t_place_v8)` for placing.
           
           However, the allowed actions are very restricted.  I have only `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action, `move_base`, just changes the base configuration, which doesn't directly affect the relationships between the objects (i.e. `on` predicates). Furthermore, no `pick` or `place` instances are provided.
           
           The problem statement also makes it clear that only available action instances may be used in the plan. Since `pick` and `place` are necessary to manipulate the objects and achieve the `on` goal condition, but these are *not* provided, the goal must be unreachable. The base robot can only "move base", which will not solve the problem.
