               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning for Plan Generation:**
           
           My goal is to figure out how to move objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto surface `v18`. From the provided information, I see that these objects are currently supported by region `v11` and need to be supported by `v18`. I know that to get an object `?o` onto a surface `?r`, two things must be true: the object must be at the right pose, and it must be supported by the surface. The information I'm given implies a key insight: there is a single "target pose" `#o2` that works for all four objects. The *kin* predicate suggests that arm `v4` can reach both their current and their target poses.
           
           I understand that I can use `move_base`, `pick`, and `place` actions to accomplish this.  However, here's where things get tricky: I'm only allowed to use a *specific* list of actions.  This list *only* contains `move_base v3 v3 #o0`.  Since I cannot use any action not found in that list, I'm stuck.  I've checked the preconditions, I know how the actions work, but I cannot use them because they are not listed as available. The core of my challenge is this *very* strict limitation on which actions are allowed.
           
           I have come to the conclusion that because I cannot perform any other actions to manipulate these objects except from a single base motion. So based on the problem statement, I can confirm that the problem is not solvable.
