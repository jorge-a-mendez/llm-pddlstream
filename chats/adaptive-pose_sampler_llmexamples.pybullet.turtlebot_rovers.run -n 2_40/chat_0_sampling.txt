User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = +/- 2.5 and y = +/- 2.5. There is a vertical wall at x=0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the scene. I will try to place the robot in a clear area within the range of the target point. I need to ensure the robot is within x: [-2.5, 2.5] and y: [-2.5, 2.5].
           
           Target point: (0.45 0.55)
           
           The target is close to the vertical wall at x=0. I should avoid placing the robot on either side of this wall directly opposite the target, to prevent occlusion. I'll prioritize positions with positive x values to keep the target in view, while considering the obstacles at (0.21, 1.33) and (0.16, 1.16). I will explore positions around the target point at different angles and distances, ensuring they are within the max_range=2.
           
           Positions:
           (0.45 2.5)
           (2.45 0.55)
           (0.05 -1.45)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The previous target point was (1.8414452075958252, 1.909533977508545).
           My previous proposed positions (0.45, 2.5), (2.45, 0.55), and (0.05, -1.45) all collided with the boundary walls or the x=0 wall. This indicates I was too close to these boundaries. I need to ensure the positions are strictly within the x: [-2.5, 2.5] and y: [-2.5, 2.5] limits, and not on the boundaries themselves. Also, (0.05, -1.45) collided with the central wall, which means the target was occluded by the x=0 wall.
           
           New target point: (0.45 0.55). This target is different from the one in the previous request.
           
           Given the new target point (0.45 0.55), which is in the positive x, positive y quadrant, and relatively close to the x=0 wall, I need to find positions within 2 units of this target, avoiding the walls and known internal obstacles.
           
           I will try positions with positive x values to avoid the central x=0 wall obstructing the view. I need to consider the obstacles around (0.21, 1.33) and (0.16, 1.16), (0.33, 1.35).
           
           Positions:
           (1.45 0.55)
           (0.45 2.0)
           (1.85 1.85)
