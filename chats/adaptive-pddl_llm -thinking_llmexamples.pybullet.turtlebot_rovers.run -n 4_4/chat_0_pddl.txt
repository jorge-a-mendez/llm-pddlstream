           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment: Unachievable Goal Due to Action Restrictions**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with planning to satisfy `new-axiom@0()` in the rovers domain. This involves ensuring rovers are in specific configurations, stores are free, and that we've received images and analyses of certain objects.  My initial thinking was to break down the goal and see what actions are needed.
           
           I see that the plan needs to satisfy these conditions: the rovers have to be in specific configurations; their stores have to be free, and we need to have processed images and analyses of objects.  I broke down the individual parts to understand the exact conditions to satisfy.  I quickly realized that some of the initial conditions are already satisfied (the rovers' configurations and store states).
           
           To get the images and analyses, I'd *normally* need actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`, and `calibrate`. However, here's the rub: I'm only *allowed* to use `move` and `drop_rock`. Those actions can't achieve any of the imaging or analysis goals. I checked to make sure, since the problem states "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           Given the restricted set of actions, the plan *cannot* achieve the goal.  It's simply not possible to satisfy the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` conditions with only the actions `move` and `drop_rock`. They don't have the necessary effects to achieve them.  I've verified that the provided actions, when applied to the initial state, cannot contribute towards the satisfaction of the goals, and that the missing required actions are absolutely necessary. The goal is unachievable under these constraints.
