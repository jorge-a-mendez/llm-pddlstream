User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room defined by bounding boxes 0-4. There's a vertical wall in the middle (box 5). Several smaller boxes are scattered throughout the room, including two clusters of boxes (6 and 17, and 7-10) and individual boxes (11-16, 18-22). I will focus on finding positions within the allowed x and y ranges [-2.5, 2.5] that are also within the 2 unit radius from the target. I will try to stay away from the known obstacles.

Model:     The previous positions failed because one was out of bounds, one collided with the right wall (box 3), and one had no line of sight, likely due to the central wall (box 5) or other obstacles in that region. My target is now (0.45391106605529785 1.8006905317306519). I need to find new positions within 2 units of this point, avoiding the previously identified issues and staying within the x and y limits. I'll focus on the upper-left quadrant to avoid the right wall, the central wall, and the lower region that caused line-of-sight issues.

Model:     The previous attempts for target (0.45391106605529785 1.8006905317306519) all failed. I learned that:
           - (1.8296, 2.9926) is out of bounds (y > 2.5).
           - (2.5, 0.9926) collides with the right wall (box 3).
           - (1.5796, -1.0073) has no line of sight, likely blocked by box 5 (central wall) or other obstacles in that region.
           - (0.4539, 2.5) collides with the top wall (box 1).
           - (-1.5460, 1.8006) has no line of sight. This suggests that some obstacles like boxes 8, 10, 21, or the central wall are blocking the view from the far left side.
           - (0.0, 0.5) collides with box 5 (the central vertical wall).
           
           Given the target point (0.45391106605529785 1.8006905317306519), which is in the upper-right quadrant but close to the central wall (x=0) and the top wall (y=2.5), I need to be careful. The area around x=0 seems problematic due to box 5. The upper-right corner is also filled with obstacles (boxes 7, 18, 19, 20). I will try to place the robot to the right of the target, but not too far right to avoid box 3. I will also try positions below the target, but not directly through the central wall (box 5).
