           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Goal Reachability**
           
           My primary objective is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which, as a seasoned expert in this domain, I immediately recognized as a composite goal.  Breaking it down, it requires the fulfillment of several conditions related to image reception, analysis, and communication between the rovers and the lander.  Specifically, I need to ensure that specific images are taken and sent, as well as ensure that the required samples have been analyzed and the results sent.
           
           The initial state reveals a static configuration for the rovers: `v12` is at `conf(v12, v13)` and `v14` is at `conf(v14, v15)`.  Furthermore, I see that these locations can communicate with the lander.  However, reaching the sub-goals depends upon taking and sending images and sending sample analyses.  To analyze the plan, I quickly identified the available actions that satisfy these goals: taking images (`take_image`), calibrating cameras (`calibrate`), sending images (`send_image`), and sampling rocks (`sample_rock`). Each of these have clear preconditions and effects.
           
           Crucially, each of these actions depends on the `atconf` predicate, meaning each rover must be in the correct configuration to operate.  The initial problem state has `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`.  However, image visibility, communication range, and sampling conditions are specified using continuous parameters like `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`. The initial state, for example, specifies that image `v17` is visible to rover `v12` at `conf #o3`.  This implies that for `v12` to take this image, it must be `atconf(v12, #o3)`.  The problem, however, gives me a small, and very limited set of allowed PDDL action instances: a `move` action that has no effect. The provided move action keeps both `v12` and `v14` locked in their respective configurations. Therefore, the only available actions do not change the rover's configurations.
           
           I can immediately spot the problem: The current configurations (`v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14`) are not compatible with the necessary configurations (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`) for the required operations, and the given `move` action cannot change these configuration parameters. This fundamental constraint makes the goal impossible to reach given the limitations in the allowed actions:  The rovers are, in essence, stuck.
