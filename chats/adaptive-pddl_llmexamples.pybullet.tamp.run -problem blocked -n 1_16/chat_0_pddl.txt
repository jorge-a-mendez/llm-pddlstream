           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom stackable(v12, v18)

           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom type(v8, v17)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom graspable(v15)
           Atom type(v12, v17)
           Atom stackable(v8, v18)
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v14)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes three objects, `v8`, `v12`, and `v15`, which are `graspable` and `stackable`. They also have specific `pose` and `type` attributes. The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both of which are `handempty`. The robot is at `bconf v3` and `aconf` `v5` for arm `v4` and `aconf` `v7` for arm `v6`. The initial state also indicates that `v8` is `on` `v11`, `v12` is `on` `v14`, and `v15` is `on` `v11`.
           
           The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which, according to the axioms, is true if `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. From the initial state, we know that `v8` is of `type v17` and `v12` is of `type v17`. Therefore, we need to achieve `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           Looking at the initial state, `v8` is currently `on v11` and `v12` is `on v14`. We need to move either `v8` or `v12` to `v18`. However, there are no `pick` or `place` actions available in the list of valid action instances. The only available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which does not change the `on` predicate. Without the ability to pick up and place objects, the goal of changing an object's support (e.g., placing `v8` on `v18`) is unachievable.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable with the given set of available actions.
