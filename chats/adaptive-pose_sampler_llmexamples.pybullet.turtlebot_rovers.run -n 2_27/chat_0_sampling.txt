Model:     The scene is a square room with dimensions 5x5, centered at (0,0). There's a wall in the middle along the y-axis, dividing the room into two halves, each 2.5 units wide. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the room, including two in the top right and top left corners (7, 8), two near the center top (9, 10), and a few small, thin obstacles near the center and bottom. I need to find positions that avoid these obstacles while maintaining line-of-sight to the target.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     The previous target was (0.37, 2.08) and my proposed positions (0.1, 1.5) and (0.1, -1.5) collided with obstacle 5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)). This confirms the presence of a thin wall along the y-axis at x=0. It seems my initial interpretation of the main dividing wall was slightly off, it's at x=0, not just in the "middle". The position (1.5, 0.1) had no line of sight to the target (0.37, 2.08). This is probably because of the obstacles (9, 10, 20) in the upper part of the room. I will try to find positions on the same side of the wall (x=0) as the target, and avoid the smaller obstacles as well as the main wall.

Model:     The previous target was (-0.49, 2.19).
           (0.37, 0.1) and (1.5, 2.08) had no line of sight to the target. This indicates there are obstacles blocking the view from the right side of the x=0 wall for a target on the left side of the wall. This is consistent with obstacle 5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)). Also, (0.37, 1.0) was not reachable, possibly because it was too far from the target.
           
           I need to find positions on the same side of the x=0 wall as the target, which is the negative x-side. The target is (-0.49, 2.19), which is in the top-left quadrant. I need to be careful of obstacles 8 and 19 in this area.

Model:     The previous target was (-0.49, 2.19). It seems I didn't actually receive feedback on the last set of positions: (-1.5, 2.0), (-0.49, 0.5), (-2.0, 1.5). I will try them again since they seem reasonable. The failure feedback lists only the previous target. Given that I have not received any feedback for the target (-0.49490416049957275, 2.197087287902832), I will assume that the positions I previously provided for that target may be valid. I will attempt to reuse some of those positions while adding a new one for diversity.
