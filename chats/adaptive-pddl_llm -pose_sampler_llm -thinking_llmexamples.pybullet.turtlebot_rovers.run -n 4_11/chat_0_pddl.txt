           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of the Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with figuring out how to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, but it looks like we've got a serious problem. The goal, broken down, has several components. The initial conditions are met, so the key remaining goals are: 1) send images for objectives `v17, v18, v19, v20` using mode `v11`, 2) receive analysis for a rock of type `v2` (stone), and 3) receive analysis for a rock of type `v6` (soil). That's a reasonable set of tasks, in principle.
           
           The basic process involves a rover taking an image, then communicating the image to the lander. The lander then sends the data to some central unit. The same idea is required for obtaining rock analysis. This seems like a common space mission workflow.
           
           I looked at the available actions: `take_image`, `send_image`, `calibrate`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. To make it happen, I need to get the rovers into the right place, get their cameras ready, take the images, send the images and rock data, and receive the data. I've got two rovers and some rock samples on board.
           
           The initial state showed the configuration for the rovers, and I see that there are certain preconditions to perform these tasks, like needing to be in a place where you can see the target (communication, image, or sample). Now, here's where things fall apart: It appears that the rovers' movements are *restricted*. They can only perform self-loops - stay where they are. In order to calibrate, send image, or collect a sample, they would need to be in a different configuration.
           
           The preconditions like `imagevisible` and `comvisible` require the rovers to be in specific configurations. However, the current configuration is `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`. No move action allows any configuration change. These rovers are stuck! And with no way to move between places, I have no way to calibrate or do anything but observe.
           
           So, the key issue is that the `move` actions are self-loops. This means the rovers *cannot* reach the configurations required by the actions necessary to achieve the goal. No amount of planning can overcome this fundamental constraint. Given that the rovers are stuck and cannot reach the necessary configurations for communication, image taking, and rock sampling, the goal is simply *unreachable* with the given actions.
