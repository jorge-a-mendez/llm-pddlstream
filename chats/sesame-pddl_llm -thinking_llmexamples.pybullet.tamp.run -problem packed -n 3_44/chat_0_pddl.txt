(Thoughts: **Planning to Achieve Multiple "On" Goals**
           
           Okay, here's my thinking process. The objective is to get three objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`) onto a target region/object (`v16`).  I'm dealing with a familiar setup: a robot arm (`v4`), some graspable objects at specific poses, and the need to maneuver and manipulate them.
           
           First, I examined the current state.  I noted that the robot starts at base configuration `v3` and has an empty hand. The objects I need to move are currently at different poses (`v9`, `v13`, `v15`) and supported by `v11`. Importantly, they are also all *stackable* on `v16`, which is key.  I also recognized a significant detail: there's a symbolic pose `#o2` that's *already* defined as being supported by `v16`. This means I don't need to reason about finding a stable placement—the planner already gives me a valid target.
           
           The goal explicitly requires these objects to be *on* `v16`. Given what I've seen in the available predicates, the obvious solution is to place them at `#o2`. I know that because being *on* means being *supported* and *at* a certain position. And I was given `#o2` as a viable, supported position.
           
           My approach is straightforward: I'll use the available `pick` and `place` actions of the arm. I'll need to move the robot's base to a required configuration (`#o3`) so I can do the pick and place actions, and the kinematically possible grasps and trajectories are already available.
           
           Here's the plan I formulated:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  From `v3` to `#o3` (necessary for the pick/place actions).
           2.  **Pick v8:** From its current pose (`v9`).
           3.  **Place v8:** At the target pose (`#o2`).
           4.  **Pick v12:** From its current pose (`v13`).
           5.  **Place v12:** At the target pose (`#o2`).
           6.  **Pick v14:** From its current pose (`v15`).
           7.  **Place v14:** At the target pose (`#o2`).
           
           I carefully checked the preconditions for each step, particularly the *safety* conditions related to collision and trajectories.  Since I had no explicit negative facts about collisions (e.g., that placing `v8` at `#o2` would collide with `v12` or `v14`), and the unsafe approach/trajectory predicates weren't true, I assumed the action could proceed.
           
           As each step of the plan executes, I confirmed that the preconditions of the subsequent action are met, and that the goals `on(v8,v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14,v16)` are satisfied after execution. The result is a robust and complete sequence that delivers the desired outcome.
