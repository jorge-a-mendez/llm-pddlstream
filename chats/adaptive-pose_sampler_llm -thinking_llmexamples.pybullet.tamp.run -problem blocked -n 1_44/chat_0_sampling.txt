(Thoughts: **Stable Object Placements on Surface 0**
           
           Alright, let's get this done. I need to place an object (ID 5, dimensions 0.07 x 0.07) stably 50 times on Surface 0, which is an AABB from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0).  First, I've got to figure out where I can actually *put* the thing.
           
           Given the object's square shape, the dimensions are the same regardless of the angle. I can then use basic geometry to establish the bounds:  the object's center must be within a rectangle slightly smaller than the surface, to account for the object's half-size. So, the valid `x` range is from 4.2 + (0.07/2) = 4.235 to 4.8 - (0.07/2) = 4.765.  Similarly, the valid `y` range is -0.6 + (0.07/2) = -0.565 to 0.0 - (0.07/2) = -0.035.
           
           Now for the placements. Since the object is small relative to the surface and square, I can create a grid and vary its position. I'll use a 7x7 grid (49 placements). For the final placement, I can make it with a different angle which will increase the variety.
           
           I will iterate through x and y values within valid ranges, rounding the x, y values to 6 decimal places. Theta should be mostly 0, since with a square that's fine for stability. However, I can use a different theta value for a varied orientation, particularly for the last object to vary it. I'll make the final placement with the center rotated at pi/4.
           
           This will generate exactly 50 distinct placements, with mostly theta = 0, and one at theta = pi/4 for some variety.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning for Object Placement**
           
           I'm tasked with placing a new object (ID 10) on a surface, ensuring it doesn't collide with a previously placed object (ID 5).  I know the surface's dimensions and the object's size, and I've simplified the object's dimensions to 0.088 x 0.088, making it a square.
           
           First, I calculate the valid region within the surface bounds where I can place the object.  Then, I consider the existing object (ID 5), its AABB, and ensure that the new object's placement avoids any collisions. I use the AABB collision check and make a quick region analysis to exclude the region where a potential collision may occur.
           
           I need to generate 50 placement points. To get a good spread, I start by creating a 7x7 grid within the valid surface area.  I know one grid point (which I confirm with region analysis) could cause a collision (I use region analysis to find this), and I will replace it. All other 48 points on the grid will be valid, plus 2 more.
           
           To be extra safe, I will add two more points: the surface center and with two different rotations.  This will give me the 50 placements.  I will use this information to feed a placement system later.
