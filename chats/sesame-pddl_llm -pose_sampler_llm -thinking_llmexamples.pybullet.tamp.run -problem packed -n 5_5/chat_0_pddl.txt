(Thoughts: **Placing the Square Object**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable positions for this square object on the square surface. I know the dimensions of both: the object's about 0.073 units on each side, and the surface is 0.27 units across. It's all centered at the origin, which is convenient.
           
           The key here is that the object is a square.  That means rotations make a difference in its footprint. I need to take that into account. A simple rotation won't cut it.  I've got to find a good mix of angles to get diverse positions. Since the square is always the same shape, just oriented differently, the *theta* rotation angle is the main parameter for diversity.
           
           I have to think about the object's bounding box – the smallest rectangle that can contain the rotated object. When it's straight, that bounding box has sides of length 0.073. But when rotated 45 degrees, the corners stretch out the bounding box.  I need to calculate the bounding box based on how it's rotated. This affects *how far* I can move the object on the surface.
           
           I'll use some angles like `0`, `pi/8`, `pi/4`, `3*pi/8` and `pi/2`. These are a diverse enough set. To do this, I need to know the *half* extent of the bounding box. The surface half extent is 0.135.  The valid placement area is a square inside the surface.
           
           So, I calculated the placement range and then evenly distributed 10 points within those ranges at each angle: the surface center, the four corners, midpoints of edges, and a center-edge point. That gave me exactly the 50 placements I needed: a diversity of rotations, with a spread of points in each rotation.

(Thoughts: **My Solution for Stable Object Placement**
           
           I'm faced with a new challenge: placing object ID 7 on surface 0 without colliding with the existing object ID 4.  My expertise dictates a methodical approach, ensuring both stability and adherence to spatial constraints.
           
           First, I need to understand the playing field.  Surface 0 is defined by the region `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  Object 7 is a square with side length `0.09063686356664791`.  Object 4, already successfully placed at (0, 0, 0), has a side length of `0.07269701775388726`. The goal is to identify 50 stable placements for object 7 that avoid any collision with object 4, which is at the center of the surface with no rotation.
           
           My strategy involves calculating the bounding box for object 7 for different rotations, and then applying collision detection against object 4. I'll need to consider how a square's rotated AABB changes with rotation, and then find where it can be placed without collision.
           First, I recognize that the maximum center coordinate for object 7 on the surface is restricted by the surface bounds.  The square's rotated AABB depends on its rotation (theta). Using the surface bounds of the surface and the half-extents of the AABB, I can compute the valid range of center coordinates for object 7.
           
           Then, I need to consider collisions with object 4.  I know object 4's coordinates, and I can calculate the AABB for a specific `theta`, then check if the AABB's overlap. If they do, there's a collision.
           
           Since object 4 is at (0,0) and is also a square object, it makes placing object 7 at the center more difficult.
           
           I've determined that due to the object sizes and surface constraints, and after calculating and comparing the values above, I'm only able to use theta of 0 and pi/2 for the object to fit and not collide.
           
           After the analysis, I've concluded that stable, collision-free placements are only possible at `theta=0` or `theta=pi/2`.  For these two angles, the max center coordinate is `L = 0.08968156821667604`, and the min collision abs center coordinate (so, the coordinate's absolute value) is `C = 0.08166694066026758`.
           
           I'll now need to pick 25 points on each of the rotations. To cover the space as best as possible, for `theta=0`:
             * Points along the board's edge, within the bounds.
             * Points that would collide with the existing object.
           and then apply that same principle to the 25 points, with the `theta=pi/2` rotation applied. This will satisfy the non-collision requirements.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 6**
           
           I'm tasked with placing a new, square object (ID 6) with a side length of approximately 0.095 on a square surface. The surface has a half-width of 0.135.  I need to ensure 50 stable placements are found.  My primary challenge is to avoid collisions with two other objects already on the surface:
           
           *   **Object 4:** A smaller square centered at (0,0) with a side of ~0.07. Its AABB extends roughly 0.036 in each direction.
           *   **Object 7:** A square with a side length of ~0.09 and placed at roughly (-0.089, -0.089). Its AABB is centered there, extending about 0.045 in each direction.
           
           I must also adhere to the surface boundary constraints.  
           
           To avoid collisions, I need to understand that the object's rotation angle (`theta`) will impact its AABB.  The rotation means I can not simply use the object side length/2, but must instead use a rotationally-adjusted half-extent. I then derived some simplified conditions:
           1.  **Surface Containment:** The center of object 6 must be within the square surface bounds, considering its rotated AABB.
           2.  **No Collisions:**  Object 6's AABB cannot overlap those of Object 4 or Object 7.  That means calculating the distance between the potential center placement for object 6 and the AABBs of objects 4 and 7 and avoiding all areas that risk collisions.
           
           I focused on analyzing possible placements for specific angles of rotation: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, and pi/2.  I decided it was sufficient to only utilize theta 0 and pi/2 to ensure sufficient placement stability.
           
           I can then solve for safe placement regions by combining the surface bounds with the collision avoidance conditions for each value of theta, resulting in areas within the overall surface with gaps to avoid the overlapping areas.
           
           For theta=0 and theta=pi/2:
           *   I calculated the minimum x or y that the Object 6 can be offset, so as to not collide with object 4, the minimum x or y center location, so as not to collide with object 7, and the max bound on x and y given the surface size.
           *   I set those up and solved for points (x, y) that satisfy the non-collision constraints.
           
           Given the constraints, I found valid placements clustered primarily at the outer corners and edges of the available surface space.  This approach of placing points at the edges and in the corner spaces allows a collection of placement point choices and thereby satisfies the initial task of finding 50 stable points.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: A Comprehensive Analysis**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing a new, square object (ID 5) on surface 0, and I need to ensure 50 stable placements.  My expert intuition kicks in, and I know I have to consider a few key constraints: the object has to stay *within* the boundaries of surface 0, and crucially, it *cannot* collide with the existing objects 4, 6, and 7.
           
           First things first: the surface. Surface 0 is a square, defined by its corners' coordinates.  I immediately calculate the half-width, "s_surf_half," which is 0.135. Then I have the size of the new square, "s_obj5," which is 0.0977. Since it's a square I know how to calculate it's AABB extents given a rotation.
           
           Now, those existing obstacles... I need their exact placements and sizes.
           *   **Object 4** sits right in the center with a size (0.072).
           *   **Object 7** is diagonally placed to the bottom-left of the surface, defined by its center point (-0.08968, -0.08968) and a size of 0.0906.
           *   **Object 6** is diagonally placed to the top-right of the surface, with a center at (0.0874, 0.0874) and a size of 0.0951.
           
           To determine stable placements, I need to understand that the new object must not go beyond the bounds of the surface 0, and that it must not collide with other objects. I will use the bounding box calculations for each existing object and take the value of `H5 = s_obj5 / 2 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))` which is half the object extent and use it to determine the placement of new object as a function of theta.
           
           **Placement Constraints in Detail:**
           
           *   **Surface Containment:**  The object's center must be far enough from the edges of surface 0. My calculations show this as `abs(cx) <= s_surf_half - H5` and `abs(cy) <= s_surf_half - H5`. I'll call this maximum distance "MaxC".
           *   **Collision Avoidance (Object 4):**  I need to ensure the object's boundaries don't overlap Object 4's bounding box. So that I do not have a collision, I ensure the bounding boxes are far from each other, which in my calculations appears as `abs(cx) >= H4 + H5` or `abs(cy) >= H4 + H5`. I'll call `H4 + H5`  as `MinC4`.
           *   **Collision Avoidance (Object 7):** Object 7 is in the bottom-left so I need to make sure the object center "cx" is far enough so it does not collide. The range of values needed will be `cx >= x7_range[1] + H5` or `cy >= y7_range[1] + H5`, and call them `MinC7_x` and `MinC7_y`.
           *   **Collision Avoidance (Object 6):**  Object 6 is in the top-right so the object center `cx` must be `cx <= x6_range[0] - H5` or `cy <= y6_range[0] - H5`. I'll call this `MaxC6_x` and `MaxC6_y`.
           
           Now, I analyze each rotation angle to identify valid placement regions. I will start with zero rotation.
           
           **Analyzing Candidate Rotation Angles:**
           
           *   **Rotation = 0 degrees (and 90 degrees):**  This gives us a known value for `H5`, and I crunch the numbers, I find the valid range for the center of object 5 based on collision avoidance with other objects on the surface.
               *   I determined the regions that can be used: I calculate the maximum distances,  I use `MaxC` which is 0.0861, which provides me an area `abs(cx) <= 0.086137` and `abs(cy) <= 0.086137`, and also have collision ranges with objects 4, 7, and 6. I need the placement to be at `abs(cx) >= 0.085211` or `abs(cy) >= 0.085211`.

           To determine stable placements, I need to understand that the new object must not go beyond the bounds of the surface 0, and that it must not collide with other objects. I will use the bounding box calculations for each existing object and take the value of `H5 = s_obj5 / 2 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))` which is half the object extent and use it to determine the placement of new object as a function of theta.
           
           **Placement Constraints in Detail:**
           
           *   **Surface Containment:**  The object's center must be far enough from the edges of surface 0. My calculations show this as `abs(cx) <= s_surf_half - H5` and `abs(cy) <= s_surf_half - H5`. I'll call this maximum distance "MaxC".
           *   **Collision Avoidance (Object 4):**  I need to ensure the object's boundaries don't overlap Object 4's bounding box. So that I do not have a collision, I ensure the bounding boxes are far from each other, which in my calculations appears as `abs(cx) >= H4 + H5` or `abs(cy) >= H4 + H5`. I'll call `H4 + H5`  as `MinC4`.
           *   **Collision Avoidance (Object 7):** Object 7 is in the bottom-left so I need to make sure the object center "cx" is far enough so it does not collide. The range of values needed will be `cx >= x7_range[1] + H5` or `cy >= y7_range[1] + H5`, and call them `MinC7_x` and `MinC7_y`.
           *   **Collision Avoidance (Object 6):**  Object 6 is in the top-right so the object center `cx` must be `cx <= x6_range[0] - H5` or `cy <= y6_range[0] - H5`. I'll call this `MaxC6_x` and `MaxC6_y`.
           
           Now, I analyze each rotation angle to identify valid placement regions. I will start with zero rotation.
           
           **Analyzing Candidate Rotation Angles:**
           
           *   **Rotation = 0 degrees (and 90 degrees):**  This gives us a known value for `H5`, and I crunch the numbers, I find the valid range for the center of object 5 based on collision avoidance with other objects on the surface.
               *   I determined the regions that can be used: I calculate the maximum distances,  I use `MaxC` which is 0.0861, which provides me an area `abs(cx) <= 0.086137` and `abs(cy) <= 0.086137`, and also have collision ranges with objects 4, 7, and 6. I need the placement to be at `abs(cx) >= 0.085211` or `abs(cy) >= 0.085211`.
