           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, here's my analysis. I'm faced with a problem where I need to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`.  My initial state shows them all currently on `v11`.  Specifically, I have facts like `on(v14, v11)` which comes from `supported(v14, v15, v11)` and `atpose(v14, v15)`. The other two objects follow a similar structure.
           
           The goal state requires `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  To achieve this, based on the `on` axiom (which relies on `supported` and `atpose`), I need to get each object positioned at a supported pose on `v16`. Looking at the available facts, it appears the supporting pose is `#o2` for all three objects.  So the subgoals are `atpose(v8, #o2)`, `atpose(v12, #o2)`, and `atpose(v14, #o2)`.
           
           However, here's the critical issue: I'm only allowed to use the action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action doesn't modify `atpose` or `on` facts. It seems to only update `atbconf` and `canmove`. The actions I need to move objects, like `pick` and `place`, are explicitly *not* allowed.
           
           Because I cannot manipulate the `atpose` facts, and the `on` facts are derived directly from the `atpose` facts, I'm stuck. My available actions are useless for achieving the goal, given the constraints.  Therefore, I conclude the goal state of `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)` is *unreachable* with the given action set.
