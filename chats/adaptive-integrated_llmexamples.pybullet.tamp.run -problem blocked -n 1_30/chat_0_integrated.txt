User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.689, -0.484), (-4.603, -0.399)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.646, -0.442, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.613, 0.79).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom pose(v15, v16)

           Atom graspable(v15)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)

           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene consists of three graspable objects: v8, v12, and v15. There are two arms, v4 and v6, both of which are currently empty. Object v12 is at pose v13, object v8 is at pose v9, and object v15 is at pose v16. Object v8 is supported by v11 at pose v9, and v15 is supported by v11 at pose v16. Object v12 is supported by v14 at pose v13.
           
           The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which is equivalent to `on(green, v18)` and `type(green, v17)`. The object `green` is not explicitly defined in the problem description, however, from the given initial state, we know that `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`. The axiom definition `new-axiom@0()` implies that `green` is either v8 or v12, as these are the only objects with type v17 in the initial state. Since both v8 and v12 can be on v18 (due to `stackable(v8, v18)` and `stackable(v12, v18)`), we can choose either one. Let's aim to place `v8` onto `v18`.
           
           There are no pick, place, clean or cook actions available for the robot to execute. The only action available is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not change the state of any objects or their locations, so it cannot achieve the goal of placing an object on `v18`. Therefore, the goal is unreachable with the given set of available actions.
