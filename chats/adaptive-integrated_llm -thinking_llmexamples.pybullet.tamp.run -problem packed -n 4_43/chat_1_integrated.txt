User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object

           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object

           v14: object
           v15: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.205, 0.167), (0.278, 0.24)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.162, 0.451, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.972, -0.236).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.13, -0.456), (0.229, -0.357)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.022, 0.26, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.857, 0.516).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.025, 0.212), (0.069, 0.307)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.242, 0.203, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.692, 0.722).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.18, -0.406, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.935, -0.353).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.115, 0.404), (0.209, 0.498)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement on Target Surface**
           
           My objective is to move four objects, specifically v8, v12, v14, and v16, onto the surface v18. Initially, they are supported by a surface v11.  The robot's base configuration is fixed at v3, and arm v4 is the available manipulator. Since the robot is at a fixed base, I'll need to use the manipulator to pick and place the objects. The solution involves performing a series of pick-and-place actions, utilizing the available "kin" facts. The task simplifies to a series of pick and place actions. For each object, I'll execute: `pick` it from its current position on `v11` and then `place` it onto a calculated position on `v18`. Each `pick` action will require a specific grasp, a pose of the object, the object, the arm, and the base configuration, which are all present.  I'll then perform a `place` action using the grasp, object, the arm, the base configuration, and a target pose on surface `v18`.
           
           The placement strategy hinges on finding four distinct, collision-free locations for the objects on `v18`.  Given the dimensions of the objects and the available space on v18, I've devised a 2x2 grid-like configuration to ensure sufficient space between objects. Here's a summary of the placements I've developed.
           
           The final poses are:
           
           *   For `v16` on `v18`: `x = -0.06, y = 0.06, z = 0.781, theta = 0.0`
           *   For `v14` on `v18`: `x = 0.06, y = 0.06, z = 0.781, theta = 0.0`
           *   For `v8` on `v18`: `x = -0.06, y = -0.06, z = 0.781, theta = 0.0`
           *   For `v12` on `v18`: `x = 0.06, y = -0.06, z = 0.781, theta = 0.0`
           
           The calculated placements will maintain object separation and fit within the dimensions of `v18`.  I'll need to adjust the coordinates based on the objects' AABBs to prevent collisions. Given the preconditions, it seems that there is a defined kin configuration.
           
           The general plan will work through 8 actions:
           1.  `(pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4)`: Pick `v16`.
           2.  `(place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`: Place `v16` with the specified coordinates.
           3.  `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4)`: Pick `v14`.
           4.  `(place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`: Place `v14` with the specified coordinates.
           5.  `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4)`: Pick `v8`.
           6.  `(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`: Place `v8` with the specified coordinates.
           7.  `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4)`: Pick `v12`.
           8.  `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`: Place `v12` with the specified coordinates.
           
           I am planning the correct values and object pose calculations.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm looking at this problem, and it's pretty clear where we're headed. The user pointed out the obvious: the previous plan attempted `pick` and `place` actions, and those aren't even *allowed*. The only thing the robot can do is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which, let's be honest, is as useless as it sounds. It moves the base... to the *same* location. Wonderful.
           
           The goal is to get several objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`) onto a specific location, `v18`. Right now, they're supported and *atpose* on `v11`, implying they're currently on that location, but not in `v18`. Classic block-stacking problem, except... no stacking.
           
           The problem, as I see it, boils down to this: *how* are we going to change the `on` predicate? The only action available, `move_base`, doesn't touch objects! It’s all about robot configuration and movement, not object manipulation. It changes `atbconf` and `canmove`, but not the crucial `on` predicates that determine the objects' position.
           
           Given that the goal *requires* changing `on`, and the only action we have *cannot* change `on`, the logical conclusion is that this goal is completely *unachievable* with the given action set. It's a fundamental mismatch between the action's capabilities and the goal's requirements. This plan is dead in the water; we're essentially trying to use a hammer to screw in a light bulb.
