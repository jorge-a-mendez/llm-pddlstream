(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           My goal is to place 50 stable instances of object 8 onto surface 0. Surface 0 is a square, specifically the region defined by the corners (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135).  The object itself is essentially a square with sides of length approximately 0.0874297. Because the object is close to a square, the AABB rotation strategy must be followed, even if it is a slightly rotated square.
           
           A placement is a tuple (surf_idx, theta, x, y), where surf_idx is the surface index (always 0 here), theta is the rotation angle, and (x, y) is the center of the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB). For the placement to be stable, the rotated object's AABB must fit within the surface's bounding box.
           
           First, I defined the surface boundaries:  `surf_min_x = -0.135`, `surf_max_x = 0.135`, `surf_min_y = -0.135`, and `surf_max_y = 0.135`. The surface's width and height are both 0.27.  Because of the object's small size, I know any rotation will fit on the surface, since `max_dim = obj_s * sqrt(2) = 0.123646`.
           
           To ensure good coverage, I'm considering 5 rotation angles: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, and pi/2. I'm using an approximation strategy since `obj_h` is slightly different from `obj_w`.  The `w_prime` and `h_prime` is calculated using `w_prime = obj_w * abs(cos(theta)) + obj_h * abs(sin(theta))` and `h_prime = obj_w * abs(sin(theta)) + obj_h * abs(cos(theta))`. Given that `obj_w` and `obj_h` are essentially equal, the values of `w_prime` and `h_prime` will be the same due to rotation symmetry.  Therefore, I'm calculating 10 `(x, y)` points for each of these angles.
           
           The valid ranges for the object's center are determined by:
           *   `x_min_valid = surf_min_x + w_prime / 2`
           *   `x_max_valid = surf_max_x - w_prime / 2`
           *   `y_min_valid = surf_min_y + h_prime / 2`
           *   `y_max_valid = surf_max_y - h_prime / 2`
           
           I generated a set of valid `(x, y)` points (x, y) coordinates for each theta:
           
           *   For `theta = 0`: The object has dimensions (0.08742972652527459, 0.08742972652527457). The ranges are  `x_center_min = -0.09128513673736279, x_center_max = 0.09128513673736279, y_center_min = -0.09128513673736278, y_center_max = 0.09128513673736278`.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 4**
           
           Alright, I've got a new task: placing object 4 on this surface, but it has to avoid colliding with object 8, which is already placed. Object 4 is almost square, so I'll treat it as such for calculating the rotated bounding box (AABB). I know object 8's position and dimensions, and its AABB is tightly packed in the bottom-left corner of the surface.
           
           My strategy? Generate 50 placements for object 4, ensuring none overlap object 8. To do this, I'll calculate the rotated AABB's dimensions for different angles (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2). Then, I'll generate the *valid* ranges of center positions (x, y) for object 4. Since object 8 is in the bottom-left, I will generate placements where object 4 is positioned *entirely* to the right of object 8's AABB. I'll make sure each placement's *x* coordinate is greater than a safe threshold, which is object 8's right-most edge plus half of object 4's longest dimension (for that angle). This is a safe region.
           
           I'll pick 5 evenly spaced *x* positions in that safe region and combine them with two *y* coordinates (top and bottom). By ensuring the *x* positions are to the right of the object 8, I ensure that there's no collision in that direction. This will ensure I generate 50 non-colliding placements.

(Thoughts: **Placing Object ID 5 on Surface 0: A Strategy for Collision-Free Placement**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a new, almost square object (ID 5) on Surface 0, ensuring no overlap with existing objects (ID 8 and ID 4). Here's my detailed approach, leveraging my expertise in geometric reasoning and collision detection:
           
           **1. Analyze the Surface and Objects:**
           
           *   **Surface 0:**  A 0.27 x 0.27 square, bounded by (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135).
           *   **Object ID 5:** Nearly square dimensions (around 0.07 x 0.07). The exact dimensions will depend on the rotations performed.
           *   **Existing Objects:**
               *   **ID 8:** Located in the bottom-left, occupying roughly ((-0.135, -0.135), (-0.04757, -0.04757)).
               *   **ID 4:** Located to the right of ID 8, extending further up, occupying roughly ((-0.04757, -0.135), (0.05021, -0.03722)).
               I'll use their approximate AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) to quickly detect potential collisions.
           
           **2.  Determining Valid Placement Regions:**
           
           *   **Object 5's Rotated AABB:** I'll use the original dimensions as the basis, given the square-like shape. Rotating the object will slightly change the dimensions (the diagonal will be slightly longer than the original length). The maximum dimension will be approximately 0.0992 when rotated at 45 degrees.
           *   **Surface Constraints:** Any object must fit entirely within the surface bounds. After accounting for rotations and the AABB, the valid x and y ranges are:
               *   `[ -0.135 + w_prime/2, 0.135 - w_prime/2 ]`
               *   `[ -0.135 + h_prime/2, 0.135 - h_prime/2 ]`
               Where `w_prime` and `h_prime` depend on rotation.
           
           **3.  Collision Avoidance Strategy:**
           
           *   **Occupied Space:** Combining the existing AABBs, the occupied region is roughly from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.05021, -0.03722).
           *   **Strategic Placement:**  I'll place Object ID 5 *above* the existing objects. This simplifies collision checking by ensuring `min_y5 >= max_y_occupied`.
           *   **Specific Placement Area:** The strategy is to place Object ID 5 such that the y coordinate is `y - h_prime/2 >= max_y_occupied`.
               So, I'll restrict the y-range, and the range for y will be `[max(-0.135 + h_prime/2, max_y_occupied + h_prime/2), 0.135 - h_prime/2]`.
           *   **X Placement:** I'll consider the x range to be `[-0.135 + w_prime/2, 0.135 - w_prime/2]`.
           
           **4.  Generating 50 Placements:**
           
           I'll use 5 different rotation angles (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2). For each rotation:
           
           *   Calculate `w_prime` and `h_prime`.
           *   Determine the valid x and y coordinate ranges (based on the surface and maximum y in the existing placements).
           *   For each rotation, generate x and y coordinate pairs within their valid ranges: 5 values for the x coordinates and 2 values for the y coordinates.
           
           **Detailed Calculations and Ranges:**
           
           *   I've carefully calculated the bounding boxes and dimensions in the above prompt.
           *   The final coordinates I am using are those in the prompt.
           
           By following this strategy, I can confidently generate 50 collision-free and stable placements for Object ID 5 on Surface 0. This approach prioritizes efficient calculations and ensures reliable object placement.

               Where `w_prime` and `h_prime` depend on rotation.
           
           **3.  Collision Avoidance Strategy:**
           
           *   **Occupied Space:** Combining the existing AABBs, the occupied region is roughly from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.05021, -0.03722).

               So, I'll restrict the y-range, and the range for y will be `[max(-0.135 + h_prime/2, max_y_occupied + h_prime/2), 0.135 - h_prime/2]`.
           *   **X Placement:** I'll consider the x range to be `[-0.135 + w_prime/2, 0.135 - w_prime/2]`.
           
           **4.  Generating 50 Placements:**
           
           I'll use 5 different rotation angles (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2). For each rotation:
           
           *   Calculate `w_prime` and `h_prime`.
           *   Determine the valid x and y coordinate ranges (based on the surface and maximum y in the existing placements).
           *   For each rotation, generate x and y coordinate pairs within their valid ranges: 5 values for the x coordinates and 2 values for the y coordinates.
           
           **Detailed Calculations and Ranges:**

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 7**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable locations for object ID 7 on surface 0, making sure it doesn't collide with objects 8, 4, or 5 that are already there. Surface 0 is a square with sides of 0.27. Object 7 itself is almost square.
           
           First, I calculate the occupied area from the existing objects. Then, I decided on a grid sampling strategy, using the available space on the surface. For object 7, I consider rotations from 0 to pi/2, in steps. For each rotation, I calculate the object's dimensions based on `w` and `h` . I then use a grid of points on the surface, making sure the object's center is within the surface boundaries, at that particular rotation. I then filter for collisions, using a simple AABB overlap check. I need to make sure the object's AABB is not overlapping with those of the fixed obstacles. The grid is a 10x10 point grid. I will take the first 50 solutions.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for New Object (ID 6)**
           
           My primary goal is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID: 6) on surface 0, while treating previously placed objects as immovable obstacles. The surface area is defined as (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  I've meticulously calculated the bounding boxes (AABBs) of four existing objects (IDs 8, 4, 5, and 7) and their precise positions, including any slight rotational offsets. The union of these AABBs defines the occupied space.
           
           Given that the object is square and has a width of 0.09787, I will generate placements for multiple rotations. I know that rotations will influence the effective dimensions of my object, with `w_prime` and `h_prime` being the effective width and height. I'll focus on rotations of 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, and pi/2.
           
           To find valid positions, I will evaluate a grid of potential center coordinates within the available space. For each candidate center, I'll calculate the new object's AABB. I'll then check for collisions between this new AABB and the AABBs of the existing objects.  I will look for areas with less overlap with the existing objects, likely in the top-right quadrant. This will be the main strategy, and the implementation will be in Python.  If collisions do occur, I'll discard these coordinates. I will continue this process until I have found 50 valid placements, or exhausting all possible combinations based on the parameters chosen. The code includes checks to ensure valid samples are created, even with edge cases.
