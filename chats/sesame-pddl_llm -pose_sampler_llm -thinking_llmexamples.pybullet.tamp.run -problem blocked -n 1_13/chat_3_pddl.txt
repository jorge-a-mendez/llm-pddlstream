           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:

           ((place v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.
           
           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q0', '#t1'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q0', '#q1', '#t3'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', '#p0', '#g0', '#q1', '#t2'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-traj-pose:('#t0', 'v15', 'v16')->()`, which impeded executing the action pick('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0').
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           My goal is to achieve the state defined by `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to placing an object of type `v17` on region `v18`.  I see two candidates, `v8` and `v12`, both currently on different regions (`v11` and `v14` respectively). My primary approach involves using `pick` and `place` actions to move one of these objects to the target location.
           
           **Obstacles: Unsafe Trajectory and Grasps**
           
           Upon analyzing the provided actions, I quickly encountered a major obstacle. All `pick` and `place` actions use a trajectory denoted as `#o4`. A crucial component from the previous failed attempt indicates a collision between this trajectory and object `v15` at location `v16`, which makes the trajectory unsafe. The core problem is that all the valid pick and place action are invalidated because of unsafe trajectory and its implications.
           
           **Analysis of Action Preconditions**
           
           Further, the preconditions of `pick` actions include `NegatedAtom unsafeatraj(?t)`. This requirement confirms my analysis that the trajectory `#o4` poses a collision threat as the previous attempt. Since there are collision, `NegatedAtom unsafeatraj(#o4)` is false, all pick and place actions becomes invalid.
           
           In addition, the `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)` precondition on `pick` actions raises additional concerns. This precondition means that, if `?o` is chosen as the pick object, there can not be any other graspable object in the scene. In the current state, `v8`, `v12`, and `v15` are graspable, rendering any `pick` impossible. However, my primary focus is the issue raised by unsafe trajectory.
           
           **Conclusion: Unreachable Goal**
           
           Given the provided information, I have conclusively identified that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable. This conclusion is based on the inability to execute any `pick` or `place` action due to the collision inherent in the shared trajectory `#o4`. I can't move any objects because the only trajectory is unsafe.
