           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Placement Generation**
           
           I need to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5) on surface 0. The object is described by an AABB with dimensions 0.07 x 0.07. Surface 0 is defined by the points ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  A stable placement requires the object's AABB to be fully contained within the surface's AABB.
           
           The ambiguity in the problem statement regarding the object's dimensions and rotation is addressed by assuming the provided dimensions (0.07 x 0.07) represent the AABB that *is* placed, irrespective of rotation. This simplifies the calculations. With this assumption, the rotated AABB will *always* be the provided dimensions.  If that is *not* correct, I will be informed of such on evaluation and re-evaluate the solution.
           
           Based on this assumption, I will consider a (w, h) = (0.07, 0.07) rectangle.
           
           Surface 0 has the boundaries: x: [4.2, 4.8], y: [-0.6, 0.0]. To ensure full containment, the center of the object's AABB must fall within a smaller rectangle: x: [4.235, 4.765], y: [-0.565, -0.035].
           
           The range for `x` (0.53) and `y` (0.53) is split into 7 intervals per axis to provide a grid of 8 positions. For each of the 49 distinct (x, y) coordinates, the code iterates through 8 different angles, adding 1 more coordinate for a total of 50.
           
           The formula for the generation of the 50 placements is: (0, theta, x, y), where surface 0 is indicated by 0, the angle theta ranges from 0 to 7*pi/4, x is in [4.235, 4.765], and y is in [-0.565, -0.035].
