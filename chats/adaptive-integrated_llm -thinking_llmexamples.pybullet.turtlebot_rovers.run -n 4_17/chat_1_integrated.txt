           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Comprehensive Plan for Rovers Domain Goal**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The core objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to:
           
           1.  Rovers `v12` and `v14` are back at their starting configurations: `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`.
           2.  Both rovers have free storage: `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`.
           3.  We've received images of four objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) in mode v11: `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, etc.
           4.  We've received analysis of at least one rock of type v2, and one of type v6: `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for rocks of type v2, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for rocks of type v6.
           
           Since initial conditions 1. and 2. are already true, we just need to satisfy 3. and 4.
           
           I'll use `v12` for the imaging tasks. This rover will:
           
           1.  Move to a configuration `#o3` near the objectives to take images.
           2.  Take images of each objective using `calibrate`, then `take_image` and save those images in the memory of the rover.
           3.  Move to a configuration `#o0` to send images to the lander.
           4.  Send those images to the lander.
           5.  Return to starting configuration.
           
           And here is the plan:
           
           *   `(move v12 v13 #o2 #o3)`
           *   `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)`
           *   `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)`
           *   `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10)`
           *   `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11)`
           *   `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v19 v10)`
           *   `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v19 v10 v11)`
           *   `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v20 v10)`
           *   `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v20 v10 v11)`
           *   `(move v12 #o3 #o2 #o0)`
           *   `(send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11)`
           *   `(send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11)`
           *   `(send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v19 v11)`
           *   `(send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v20 v11)`
           *   `(move v12 #o0 #o2 v13)`
           
           Then I'll use `v14` to collect and send rock analyses. This rover will:
           
           1.  Move to a configuration `#o5` near the rocks.
           2.  Sample two rocks: one of type v2 (using object `v1`) and one of type v6 (using object `v5`).
           3.  Move to `#o0` for sending the analysis.
           4.  Send the analysis to the lander.
           5.  Return to its starting configuration.

Model:     **Comprehensive Plan for Rovers Domain Goal**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The core objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to:
           
           1.  Rovers `v12` and `v14` are back at their starting configurations: `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`.
           2.  Both rovers have free storage: `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`.
           3.  We've received images of four objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) in mode v11: `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, etc.
           4.  We've received analysis of at least one rock of type v2, and one of type v6: `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for rocks of type v2, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for rocks of type v6.
           
           Since initial conditions 1. and 2. are already true, we just need to satisfy 3. and 4.
           
           I'll use `v12` for the imaging tasks. This rover will:
           
           1.  Move to a configuration `#o3` near the objectives to take images.
           2.  Take images of each objective using `calibrate`, then `take_image` and save those images in the memory of the rover.
           3.  Move to a configuration `#o0` to send images to the lander.
           4.  Send those images to the lander.
           5.  Return to starting configuration.
           
           And here is the plan:
           
           *   `(move v12 v13 #o2 #o3)`
           *   `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)`
           *   `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)`
           *   `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10)`
           *   `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11)`
           *   `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v19 v10)`
           *   `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v19 v10 v11)`
           *   `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v20 v10)`
           *   `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v20 v10 v11)`
           *   `(move v12 #o3 #o2 #o0)`
           *   `(send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11)`
           *   `(send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11)`
           *   `(send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v19 v11)`
           *   `(send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v20 v11)`
           *   `(move v12 #o0 #o2 v13)`
           
           Then I'll use `v14` to collect and send rock analyses. This rover will:
           
           1.  Move to a configuration `#o5` near the rocks.
           2.  Sample two rocks: one of type v2 (using object `v1`) and one of type v6 (using object `v5`).
           3.  Move to `#o0` for sending the analysis.
           4.  Send the analysis to the lander.
           5.  Return to its starting configuration.
           
           Here's the plan:
           
           *   `(move v14 v15 #o2 #o5)`
           *   `(sample_rock v14 #o5 v1 v16)`
           *   `(drop_rock v14 v16)`
           *   `(sample_rock v14 #o5 v5 v16)`
           *   `(drop_rock v14 v16)`
           *   `(move v14 #o5 #o2 #o0)`
           *   `(send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v1)`

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Plan and Configurations**
           
           The previous attempt failed due to a collision between the imaging configuration (`#o3`) and the communication configuration (`#o0`) with a thin wall obstacle (`v21`). My initial choices for these configurations were at `x=0`, which fell directly in the collision zone. Now, I need to choose new configurations that avoid this obstacle while still fulfilling the overall plan's requirements.
           
           The core goal remains unchanged: Rovers `v12` and `v14` need to reach specific final configurations, Rover `v12` to handle imaging, and rover `v14` to handle sampling. The imaging task involves capturing and transmitting images of four objectives: `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`.  The sampling task includes collecting samples `v1` and `v5`. Communication with the lander `v9` is required for both.
           
           **New Configuration Choices:**
           
           *   **Obstacle `v21`:** I've identified the obstacle, a thin wall, as the primary constraint. It extends from (-0.05, -2.5) to (0.05, 2.5), meaning any x-coordinate between -0.05 and 0.05 is off-limits.
           *   **`#o3` (Imaging):**  I need to find a collision-free position for Rover `v12` to take pictures of targets. Since the start is at `(1.0, -1.75)`, my initial attempts (x=1.0 and x=-0.1) were found to be inadequate. The constraint, however, is that *one* configuration is *guaranteed* to work for *all* target objects. After analyzing the target locations, I considered (0.1, 1.5). This allows rover `v12` to see the targets and stay away from the obstacle. While the distance to one target looks a bit too far, the initial conditions *explicitly* include all the relevant information needed.  Therefore I am settling on this.
           *   **`#o0` (Communication):**  The lander (`v9`) is centered near (-1.9, -2.0) with a communication range of 4.0. I need to find a location for communication. Placing Rover `v12` or `v14` at `(-0.1, -1.75)` seems like a good solution since it is within the communication range and outside the obstacle zone.
           *   **`#o5` (Sampling):**  For sampling, the current choice `(0.5, -1.0)` seems to be appropriate since it places rover `v14` "above" the rocks `v1` and `v5` without collision.
           
           **Revised Plan with new Configurations:**
           
           Based on this analysis, I will use the following:
           *   `#o3`: (0.1, 1.5) for imaging
           *   `#o0`: (-0.1, -1.75) for communication
           *   `#o5`: (0.5, -1.0) for sampling
           
           The updated plan will maintain the previous overall structure. These coordinates satisfy the problem constraints (collision-free, reachable, and within range), and provide an adequate strategy for achieving all subgoals.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating Configurations for Rover Operations**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback that my previous configurations were running afoul of either collision constraints or reachability issues. I need to rethink the placement of a few key configurations: `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5`.
           
           First, let's address the collision concern. The problem is this obstacle, `v21`, a wall at `x=0`. I need to ensure that the rovers' base configurations don't overlap that `x=0` range. I had trouble with `x=0.1` before, it seems. Perhaps the rovers have a wider footprint than a simple point. I'm going to aim for locations farther away from `x=0` to ensure clear sailing.
           
           **1. Imaging Configuration (`#o3`)**: I need a location for rover `v12` to take images. It begins at `(1.0, -1.75)` and needs to capture images of objects at various positions. The image acquisition has a maximum range of 2.0, so I can't be *too* far away. I *must* use a single `#o3` configuration for all the imaging operations of `v12`. I need to reach all objectives, but I have collision constraints.
           
           My initial idea was `(0.1, 1.5)`, but that was colliding with `v21`. The distances from the chosen coordinate to the coordinates of the image to take (x~2.0, x~-2.0, x~-0.4, x~0.5) implies that it's impossible to reach all targets with a single `#o3` if the 2.0-range constraint is strictly enforced. It is a puzzle. The problem definition states I *must* have a single configuration, but the range constraint doesn't align with the positions of the objects.
           
           The range issue implies the problem may not be as strict as it seems, or that I misunderstand the rules.
           
           Therefore, since the range constraint is causing an issue with `(0.1, 1.5)`, I will move farther away from the obstacle `x=0`. I'm going to set `#o3 = (0.6, 1.5)` This is reasonably far from `x=0` and should be reachable from my starting point `(1.0, -1.75)`. Also, based on previous feedback, `x=0.1` failed. I'm more confident here, with `x=0.6`. I have to be able to find a good spot that enables imaging all four objectives from the same configuration in PDDL.
           
           **2. Communication Configuration (`#o0`)**: Now for the comms configuration. Both rovers (`v12` and `v14`) need to communicate with the lander. I need to make sure the position doesn't conflict with `v21`, or I will run into a collision again.
           
           The lander, `v9`, is at approximately `(-1.9, -2.0)`. I will set `x` to be `(-0.6)` to avoid conflicts.
           I'm going to place `#o0 = (-0.6, -1.75)`. This is near enough to my starting position to be accessible and is close enough to the lander to enable successful communication.
           
           **3. Sampling Configuration (`#o5`)**: Finally, the sampling configuration for `v14`. I had a problem with `(0.5, -1.0)` being "not reachable". I think this is because of a very specific path issue. I'm going to move my `#o5` location closer to the rover's starting location for improved access.
           
           I need the rover `v14` to be 'above' rocks `v1` and `v5`. The rock `v1` is on the *other* side of `v21`. From my pathing, `x=0.5` should be reachable. The previous issue likely relates to crossing the x=0 barrier. The best configuration *must* still be reachable for `v14` in the given initial state. Given the setup of the world, I'm going to trust the initial facts.
           Therefore, if `x=0.5` is not working, I'll go nearer the rover's x axis: `(-1.0)` is a good starting place, and it will be able to access the rock on the negative x-axis side if the path is unobstructed: `(-0.44,-0.86)`. This location does satisfy the constraints. The goal is to set a coordinate `x`, so a path can be constructed to the objective:

           Alright, let's break this down. We're tasked with achieving `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain. The primary challenge, as I see it, is navigating the spatial constraints, particularly the obstacle `v21` that acts as a physical barrier at `x=0`. This means our two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, are effectively confined to operate on opposite sides of the x-axis. This drastically impacts the plan.
           
           Based on the goal and initial state provided, `v12` starts at (1.0, -1.75) (x > 0) and `v14` at (-1.0, -1.75) (x < 0). We require `receivedanalysis` for rocks of types `v2` and `v6`. `v12` has access to `v1` (type v2), `v3`, `v4`, `v7`, `v8` whereas `v14` has access only to `v5` (type v6).  Simultaneously, we have imaging requirements: `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`. `v17`, `v20` are on `v12`'s side, and `v18`, `v19` on `v14`'s. Communication happens through `v9` with `v12` and `v14` at different configurations.
           
           Given that `v21` is a barrier and the persistent reachability issues with crossing the x-axis, the plan *must* exploit this spatial division. Specifically:
           
           1.  **Imaging and Sampling Division:** `v12` will handle the imaging and sampling of items on the positive x-side (v17, v20, v1, etc). `v14` covers the negative x-side (v18, v19, v5, etc).
           2.  **Configuration Requirements:**  The `conf` predicates require specifying continuous configuration values for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`. The constraint that these configs are used by multiple `rover, target` pairs means they require *distinct* coordinate values for each specific pairing of rover and target task. These have been named `#o3_v12_img`, `#o3_v14_img`, etc., for clarity.
           3.  **Path Planning Concerns:** The "not reachable" errors make the configurations tricky. So let's *only* select reasonable coordinates that are reachable given starting positions and avoid locations near the barrier. We will use *distinct* points for imaging, communication, and sampling to avoid the issue of trying to cross `x=0`.
           
           Here's the planned structure, with coordinates that are likely collision-free and reachability problems have been resolved by keeping the `x` coordinates outside the obstacle `v21`:

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning:**
           
           I'm facing a tough planning problem in the `rovers` domain. The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunction of various conditions, including being at specific locations, having free space, receiving images, and receiving analyses of rocks and soil. The problem is riddled with "not reachable" errors, especially regarding moving rovers across a narrow obstacle, `v21`.
           
           My past attempts have been consistently rejected, often because of collision detection with `v21` or the "not reachable" errors related to moving to the proposed configurations (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`). I've meticulously re-evaluated the setup, noting the crucial initial state facts: the rovers' starting positions, the obstacle's location, and the objectives' and samples' positions. A key detail: all my plans involve "continuous parameters" (those starting with '#'), and the system requires those configurations to be reachable, collision-free, and have a line of sight to the targets.
           
           The "not reachable" messages are vexing. It's difficult to move the rovers across the "wall" at `x=0`. I've hypothesized about the potential issues: it could be an overestimation of the robot's collision radius, making seemingly safe locations collide, or an underlying path planner which is not able to handle a simple scenario. I'm trying to figure out if there's an implicit hidden constraint.
           
           Based on observations and facts from the problem, I'm trying to break the problem into two parts. One part is for the rover with positive starting X, and the other for the rover with negative starting X. The most important issue is the inability for them to cross the wall at `x=0`. Since both of them have to communicate to achieve a goal that could be in either zone, and the object is supposed to be shared, I have to assume the robot can cross, even if it says it can't.
           
           If one rover is doing all work, and staying in a safe area, this leads to a simple plan of `v12` moving and `v14` staying put. This makes the `#o` configurations easier. However, due to the requirements to have the targets visible, I *have* to pick configurations for both rovers.
           
           I have come to the conclusion the only way this problem makes sense is if the parameters used are very specific, and the path planner used behind the scenes is very sensitive to those values. My attempts at choosing common locations have failed consistently. I will focus on choosing points that are close to the objectives and start locations in the hopes the planner works. If that fails, I am truly at a loss for how to proceed with the current constraints.
