           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of the Problem**
           
           Okay, here's my understanding of the situation. I'm given the task of creating a plan to reach the goal `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunctive axiom. I need to achieve the following: obtain images from four different targets (`receivedimage`), analyze a rock, and analyze soil (`receivedanalysis`). My rovers are currently in configurations v13 and v15.
           
           The initial state reveals a complex scenario: both rovers have cameras, and numerous targets are visible. Furthermore, many rocks and soil samples are also in view. Unfortunately, the permitted actions are extremely limited. I can only use the `move` actions which are essentially pointless (moving to their current config), and I can't use `drop_rock`. Because I can't leave the current configurations, and no rocks are full, I am essentially stuck.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`, I'd need to first calibrate the camera, then take the image with `take_image`, and then send the image. For `receivedanalysis`, I'd need to sample a rock using `sample_rock` and then send the analysis. However, the preconditions of all these actions include a condition, `atconf(?v, ?q)` that requires the rover to be at a specific configuration. The key here is the *only* moves available are to the current configuration, v13 to v13 and v15 to v15.
           
           Due to the constraints, I can never reach the configurations necessary for taking the images, analyzing the rocks, or sending the data. As a result, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable. No matter how much I analyze and iterate, the available action instances simply do not enable progress. Therefore, a solution plan cannot be generated.
