User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene contains a large central obstacle (0) and a set of border obstacles (1-4). There is also a vertical obstacle (5) in the middle of the environment. Several smaller obstacles (6-21) are scattered around. My strategy is to find candidate points on a circle of radius between 0.5 and 4 around the target. I will prioritize points that are not too close to the borders or the central obstacles. I'll sample a good number of points and then filter them based on the provided AABBs.
