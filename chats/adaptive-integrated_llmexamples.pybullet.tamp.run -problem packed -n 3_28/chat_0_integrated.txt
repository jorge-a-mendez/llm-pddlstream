User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.299, -0.146), (-0.211, -0.058)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.255, -0.102, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.157, 0.988).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.159, 0.29), (0.243, 0.373)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.201, 0.331, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.994, 0.111).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.058, 0.55, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.952, -0.306).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.009, 0.501), (0.106, 0.599)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom supported(v14, v15, v11)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom stackable(v14, v10)
           Atom stackable(v14, v16)
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom atpose(v14, v15)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes three graspable objects: v8, v12, and v14. They are currently located at poses v9, v13, and v15 respectively, all supported by v11. The goal is to place all three objects on v16. Only one action instance is available: `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. This means the robot cannot move, pick, or place any objects, nor can it clean or cook. Therefore, the goal is not achievable.
