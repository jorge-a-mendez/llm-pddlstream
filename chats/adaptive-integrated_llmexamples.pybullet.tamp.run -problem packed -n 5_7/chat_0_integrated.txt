           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v20)
               Atom on(v12, v20)
               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains multiple objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) that need to be placed on surface v20. The current positions of these objects are:
           - v8 is at v9, supported by v11.
           - v12 is at v13, supported by v11.
           - v14 is at v15, supported by v11.
           - v16 is at v17, supported by v11.
           - v18 is at v19, supported by v11.
           
           The robot's arm v4 is at arm configuration v5 and handempty. The robot's base is at configuration v3. There's only one allowed action: a trivial move_base action that brings the robot from v3 to v3 with a trajectory #o0. This means the robot cannot move its base. Since all pick/place actions require a kin_full state to be provided, and no such action instance has been provided, it seems like the robot cannot manipulate any object. Furthermore, there are no pick or place actions in the `available action instances` list. The only action available is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. This action just moves the base to the same position, effectively doing nothing to help achieve the goal of moving objects. Therefore, the goal is not achievable.
