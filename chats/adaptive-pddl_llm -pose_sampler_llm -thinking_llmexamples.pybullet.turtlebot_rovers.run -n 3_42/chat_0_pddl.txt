User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Robot Base Placement Strategy for Target Point (1.1, 0.6)**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've got to find 25 good spots for this robot base, all within 4 units of the target (1.1, 0.6) and stuck inside a 5x5 area. The robot's orientation will automatically adjust to face the target, so that's easy.  But there are obstacles, both fixed and that I need to avoid, and I also need a clear line of sight to the target. No giving up, I'm thinking, if one spot fails. I'll learn from it.
           
           Let's break it down:
           
           *   **Environment:** The room is simple, a big square defined by the hard limits of x: [-2.5, 2.5] and y: [-2.5, 2.5]. I need to mentally visualize this. Now, there's a list of fixed obstacles represented as AABBs, those things need my attention.  I've got to ensure the base placement avoids collisions with them and doesn't place itself inside those fixed regions (1-21).
           *   **Obstacles:** This is where the game begins! First, I need to understand that the room itself is an obstacle - the outer walls. But then there are the internal ones. Obstacle 5, a thin wall at x = 0, is the big hurdle - it'll split the room in half. The target's side will be important. I'll use those obstacles to filter out spots.
           *   **Constraints:** To be a valid spot, the base must be:
               *   Within 4 units of the target.
               *   Inside the main 5x5 room (but actually inside [-2.45, 2.45] to avoid walls - a slight buffer helps).
               *   Not inside *any* of the fixed obstacles.
               *   Have a clear line of sight to the target (no obstacles blocking the direct path).
           *   **My Strategy**
               *   **Circular Generation:** I'll start by generating points in circles around the target with radii between 0.7 and 3.9 (a bit closer and a bit further, spacing them out a bit). Those points I'll check.
               *   **Grid Search:** If I'm coming up short, I'll fill in with a grid to catch any missed spots.
               *   **Filters:** I'll apply all those tests I mentioned: distance, collision, and line of sight.
           *   **Line of Sight and the Big Wall (x=0):** My algorithm needs to be solid on the line-of-sight check. I will be looking closely at the central wall.  If the base and target end up on opposite sides of that x = 0 wall, then the spot is *immediately* a reject - a great heuristic.
           *   **Testing and Refinement:** If a position doesn't pass, I'll learn from that. If it's blocked by the central wall, that's an easy one. If it's another wall, I need to refine that test.
           
           The code's ready to roll; it's got the logic for all these checks. I'll see what the algorithm comes up with, and adjust as needed. Let's get those base positions!
