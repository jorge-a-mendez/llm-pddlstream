           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Reachability of `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My initial goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which requires an object `?green` to be both `on v18` and of a specific `type`.  I immediately identified that `?green` could be either `v12` or `v8`. However, achieving either `on(v12, v18)` or `on(v8, v18)` requires the object to be `supported` by `v18` at a specific `pose` and that `atpose` must be true.  Both objects are currently supported by `v18`, with each object currently holding an initial pose and `atpose` predicate value.
           
           I considered moving either `v12` or `v8` to the desired pose `#o2` on `v18`.  This would entail a `pick` and `place` sequence.  I focused on the preconditions of `pick` because a "valid" `place` step is only possible if a pick can be achieved.
           
           Crucially, the `pick` action's precondition includes `atbconf(?q)`. The kin relations within the initial state, however, only relate the arms to `?q` which in turn are linked to `#o3`.  This means the robot's base must be configured to `#o3` for picking/placing `v12` or `v8`.
           
           The current robot base configuration is `atbconf(v3)`.  The only available `move_base` action moves the base *from* `v3` *to* `v3`. It is impossible, within the constraints of the provided actions, to move the base *to* `#o3`. Since I cannot satisfy the robot base configuration needed for `pick` and `place` actions, the goal is unreachable.
