           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom type(v12, v17)
           Atom stackable(v8, v18)

           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable: A Deep Dive into Constraints**
           
           My primary objective is to satisfy the goal `(new-axiom@0)`, which translates to achieving both `(on ?green v18)` and `(type ?green v17)` for some object `?green`. Initially, I've identified potential candidates for `?green`: `v12` and `v8`, both of which satisfy the `type` predicate.
           
           The crucial challenge lies in satisfying `(on ?green v18)`. This requires an object to be *supported* at a specific pose *at* `v18`. Looking at the initial state, I can see that objects *could* be supported by v18.
           
           Here's the problem: To achieve this, I would need to *move* either `v12` or `v8` to be *at* the right pose on `v18`. This is where the permitted actions come into play.  The logic dictates that the only action allowed is `(move_base)`, which moves the robot base. Crucially, I am *not* allowed to use any `pick` or `place` actions, which would be essential to manipulate the objects.
           
           The `move_base` action changes the robot base position (which has no bearing on changing the `atpose` of an object), and also effectively disables all future robot movement by setting `canmove` to false. The allowed `move_base` doesn't affect `atpose` or `supported`.
           
           Since the `move_base` action does not change the necessary predicates to make `(on ?green v18)` true, and `pick` and `place` are explicitly prohibited, the goal is definitively *unachievable* given the current constraints and permitted actions. I'm essentially "stuck".
