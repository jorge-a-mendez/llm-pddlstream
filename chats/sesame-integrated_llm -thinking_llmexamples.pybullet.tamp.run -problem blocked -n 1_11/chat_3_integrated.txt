           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.735, -0.176, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.911, 0.411).
           Object p3 is a pose with position (4.5, -0.3, 0.802) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.196, 0.513)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.784, -0.226), (-4.685, -0.127)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **The Plan to Conquer `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which I've interpreted as placing a green object (`v12`) on `v18`. This boils down to getting `v12` to a pose where it's both `supported` by `v18` and in the right `atpose` state.
           
           Initially, `v12` is at `v13` and the plan is to move `v12` to a pose on `v18`, specifically defined as `#o2`. I have `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` from the initial state so all I need to do is ensure the final state is `atpose(v12, #o2)`.
           
           I've identified the following actions: `move_base`, `pick`, and `place` using the arm `v4`. The tricky part is the base configuration `q = #o3`.  The `kin` facts are crucial here: I have to ensure the base can actually reach both pickup `v13` and placing it at `#o2` with this arm.
           
           Here's the plan:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  First, the robot (starting at `v3`) must move to a base configuration `#o3` (which, ideally, lets it reach both locations). The action is `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`.
           2.  **Pick Up:** Then, it's a `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4`. The base has to be at `#o3` again.
           3.  **Place:** Finally, `place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`, placing it at `#o2`, once again using the robot's base configuration `#o3`.
           
           Now, the caveat. The core problem lies in the fact that, in the real world, it's likely impossible for a single robot base configuration to span the distance between `v13` and the target surface with reasonable arm reach.  The problem setup demands a plan based on existing facts, so I've calculated values for the continuous parameters while acknowledging it's an unrealistic reach requirement.
           
           I've calculated:
           *   **`#o0`:**  trajectory, needs no value
           *   **`#o1`:**  grasp, needs no value
           *   **`#o2`:**  target pose for `v12` = (4.5, -0.3, 0.801, 0.0) based on `v18`'s area and the assumption the object needs to be on top with the table top height.
           *   **`#o3`:**  An unrealistic base configuration = (-0.1, 0.0, 0.0)
           *   **`#o4`:**  trajectory, needs no value
           
           Finally, since the `pick` and `place` steps will result in a final state where `atpose(v12, #o2)` is true, I have successfully achieved the goal.
