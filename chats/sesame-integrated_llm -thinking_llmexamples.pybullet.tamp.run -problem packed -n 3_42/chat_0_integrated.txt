           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.015, -0.259, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, -0.033).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.093, 0.273, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.996, -0.089).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.087, -0.446), (0.182, -0.351)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.053, -0.297), (0.022, -0.222)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.052, 0.233), (0.133, 0.314)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.135, -0.398, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.971, 0.238).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've come up with to solve the problem:**
           
           The overall goal is to place three objects (v8, v12, and v14) onto surface v16, currently, all three objects are resting on surface v11. The plan will follow a classic pick-and-place methodology. The key to the plan hinges on defining a *base configuration* for the robot and unique placement poses for the objects on the target surface.
           
           I'm starting with the initial conditions: The objects are at poses v9, v13, and v15, supported by v11. v16 is described by an AABB box: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           **Here is the strategy:**
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  First, the robot needs to change its base configuration from the starting point *v3* to a new position labeled *#o3*. To achieve this, the *move\_base* action will be implemented, this involves choosing a reasonable configuration to reach all objects and the destination.
           
           2.  **Pick and Place Cycle:** For each object (v8, v12, and v14), perform the following pick-and-place sequence:
           
               *   **Pick:** From the original position (v9, v13, or v15). I will use the *pick* action.
               *   **Place:** Then, place the picked object onto *v16* by placing it at the pose *#o2*. This is the *place* action.
           
           3.  **Specific Poses:** The plan must take collision avoidance into consideration, this will be ensured by ensuring placement poses are unique for each object on v16. These poses must lie within the bounds of the AABB for v16.
               The goal is that all objects are on v16, which means placing them at:
           
               *   v8 at (0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0) relative to v16
               *   v12 at (-0.08, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0) relative to v16
               *   v14 at (0.08, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0) relative to v16
           
               This positioning ensures they are all within the target surface.
           4.  **Assumptions and Limitations:** The plan relies on a few key assumptions:
               *   I'm assuming the *kin* predicates are true.
               *   The continuous values that are associated with the plan actions are collision-free.
               *   The objects are small enough to be placed at the specified poses on v16.
               *   The approach/trajectory is not unsafe.
           
           The total cost is calculated as 6.5 (0.5 for moving the base and 3 each for pick and place).
