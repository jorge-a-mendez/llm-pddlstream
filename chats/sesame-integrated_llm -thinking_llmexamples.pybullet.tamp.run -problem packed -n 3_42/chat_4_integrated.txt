           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q0', '#t3'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v14', 'v15', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q0', '#q5', '#t13'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v14', 'p5', '#g0', '#q5', '#t8'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q5', '#q3', '#t11'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v12', 'v13', '#g1', '#q3', '#t6'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q3', '#q2', '#t12'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v12', 'p4', '#g1', '#q2', '#t2'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q2', '#q1', '#t10'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g2', '#q1', '#t1'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q1', '#q4', '#t9'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', 'p3', '#g2', '#q4', '#t7'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-traj-pose:('#t7', 'v12', 'p4')->()`, which impeded executing the action place('v4', 'v8', 'p3', '#g2', '#q4', '#t7').
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions. If the failure occurs after placing on any pose that does not start with '#', it may be due to using a combination of invalid poses.As the expert, you may decide to choose additional poses, providing their continuous values using any free pose starting with '#'. 

(Thoughts: **The Path to Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. My goal is to get v8, v12, and v14 all *on* surface v16. Simple enough, right?  The initial state shows them resting on v11, supported by it. I also know where they *can* go on v16:  we have p3, p4, and p5 already defined. The robot (v4) needs to pick each object and place it on v16.
           
           The previous plan failed, and the log says it choked on placing v8 *at* p3 with v12 already *at* p4.  Looking closer, I realized the problem wasn't static collisions but *trajectory* collisions. The objects' bounding boxes might overlap a little during movement to their positions, causing the robot's arm to run into the other objects.  p3 and p4 are close, so they might be overlapping with each other during their trajectory.
           
           Okay, let's rethink the strategy. I'm going to leverage the fact that I can define *new* poses using a generic pose named #o2. The goal is to avoid those trajectory collisions. I will use a combination of known poses and new poses to avoid that issue. I have to avoid collisions. I am given:  `pose(v8, #o2)`, `supported(v8, #o2, v16)`, `pose(v12, #o2)`, `supported(v12, #o2, v16)`,  and `pose(v14, #o2)`, `supported(v14, #o2, v16)` in the initial state. 
           
           My plan will be:
           
           1.  *move_base* to a good starting spot (#o3).
           2.  Pick v14 from its current location.
           3.  Place v14 at a NEW pose *on v16* -- let's call it `#o2_v14_on_v16` and make sure there is no collision. The coordinates for the new pose will be (0.02, 0.0, 0.782).
           4.  Pick v12 from its location.
           5.  Place v12 at ANOTHER NEW pose *on v16* -- this will be `#o2_v12_on_v16`. I'll set its coordinates to (-0.02, 0.0, 0.782) for placement.
           6.  Pick v8 from its location.
           7.  Finally, place v8 at the given pose p3.
           
           Hopefully, this avoids the prior failure. I've considered that the placing of #o2, for `v12`, `v14` will create enough distance, and this will solve the trajectory collision.  By creating a separation between objects to avoid those collisions, it should succeed.

User:      Pose #o2 = (0.02 0.0 0.782 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0) for object v14 on surface v16 is not in the correct format. Please provided poses in the format `(<x> <y> <z> <theta>)`.

           Please provide a plan and poses that achieves the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all poses are valid and stable.

(Thoughts: **Correcting the Pose Format and Verifying Placement**
           
           Okay, the issue was with the pose format. The user rightly pointed out that I provided a quaternion when the system expects `(x y z theta)`.  No problem, I can handle that.  The quaternion I was working with, `(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)`, represents no rotation, which corresponds to `theta = 0.0` radians.  I've confirmed this through a solid understanding of quaternion-to-Euler angle conversions (specifically, rotations around the Z-axis).
           
           Now, the plan I've developed seems sound.  I just need to re-submit with the corrected pose format.  Before I do, let me quickly re-verify my object placements.  I have:
           
           *   **v8 (cube)** at `p3: (0.0, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0)` which is simple and centered.
           *   **v12 (rectangle)** at `#o2` instance 1: `(-0.02, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0)`.
           *   **v14 (rectangle)** at `#o2` instance 2: `(0.02, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0)`.
           
           I'm placing these on `v16` which has an AABB of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  I'm making sure these placements don't result in collisions.  Remembering the bounding box representation. `v12` is offset to the negative-x and `v14` to the positive-x axis.  Verifying the actual object's placement with these extents relative to their center I can confirm the placements are within `v16`.
           
           My calculation of object extents using the AABB representation verifies each placement won't overlap another. They are also fully within `v16`'s AABB.  All looks good, I'm now ready to resubmit with the correctly formatted pose data.

           *   **v8 (cube)** at `p3: (0.0, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0)` which is simple and centered.
           *   **v12 (rectangle)** at `#o2` instance 1: `(-0.02, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0)`.
           *   **v14 (rectangle)** at `#o2` instance 2: `(0.02, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0)`.
           
           I'm placing these on `v16` which has an AABB of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  I'm making sure these placements don't result in collisions.  Remembering the bounding box representation. `v12` is offset to the negative-x and `v14` to the positive-x axis.  Verifying the actual object's placement with these extents relative to their center I can confirm the placements are within `v16`.
           
           My calculation of object extents using the AABB representation verifies each placement won't overlap another. They are also fully within `v16`'s AABB.  All looks good, I'm now ready to resubmit with the correctly formatted pose data.
