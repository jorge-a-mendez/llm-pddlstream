User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with inner limits from -2.5 to 2.5 in both x and y. There's a central vertical wall at x=0, and several smaller obstacles scattered around. Many obstacles are near the edges of the room. I should prioritize positions that are away from the walls and the central obstacle at x=0, as well as the other small obstacles. Since the `max_range` is 4 and the room is 5x5, there's quite a bit of flexibility. I will try to spread out my choices around the target point, considering both the allowed range and the obstacles.
