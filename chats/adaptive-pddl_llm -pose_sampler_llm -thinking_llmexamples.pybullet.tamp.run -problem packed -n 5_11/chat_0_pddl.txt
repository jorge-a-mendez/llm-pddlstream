(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My primary goal is to generate 50 stable placements for object ID 4 on surface 0, given the object's dimensions and the surface's bounding box. The object is nearly square, and the surface is a square centered at the origin. Since this is the first request for this object, I don't need to consider potential collisions with other objects yet.
           
           My strategy involves systematically exploring the placement space by varying the object's rotation angle (theta) and its center position (x, y).
           
           First, I calculate the object's effective dimensions for a given rotation angle. For each angle, I determine the valid range for the center (x, y) coordinates, ensuring the object remains fully contained within the surface boundaries.
           
           I will select 10 different rotation angles, evenly spaced from 0 to π radians. This range provides sufficient coverage of orientations for the object's effective AABB. For each selected angle, I then generate 5 unique (x, y) positions within the valid range. This combination ensures 10 angles x 5 positions = 50 placements. This should provide sufficient diversity of placements across the surface.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation for Object ID 5**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback that one placement for Object ID 4 was successful. Now, I need to figure out 50 stable placements for Object ID 5. Object ID 5 is nearly square with dimensions `0.0973100550965089` by `0.09731005509650892`. I'm working with a surface of `0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. My main constraint here is to avoid any collision between Object ID 5 and the now-fixed Object ID 4.
           
           I know Object 4's unrotated AABB dimensions, `w4 = 0.09511254055476778`, `h4 = 0.09511254055476781`, and I know its exact position: `x4=-0.0700877908990666`, `y4=-0.0700877908990666`. This means I can precisely determine its AABB. Object 4's AABB is roughly `[(-0.1176, -0.1176), (-0.0225, -0.0225)]`.
           
           For Object 5, denoted as O5, I need to find the correct `(surf_idx, theta5, x5, y5)` coordinates. I've broken this down into these steps:
           
           1.  **Angle consideration:** I decided to try generating 10 distinct angles, from `0` to `pi`, for Object 5 (O5), to ensure the best placements. The ideal effective shape of object O5 with rotation theta is `(surf_idx=0, 0 <= theta <= pi, x5, y5)`.
           2.  **AABB calculation:** I will calculate the `effective_w5`, `effective_h5` (or the equivalent AABB dimensions of the rotated Object 5).
           3.  **Find valid placement x and y ranges:** Based on the surface bounds (which are static, so easy to track, they remain consistent throughout the problem), I can determine the initial viable ranges for `x5` and `y5`.
           4.  **Collision Avoidance:** Crucially, I have to ensure that the Object 5's AABB *never* overlaps with Object 4's AABB for any of the generated placements. I know that since Object 4 has the same dimensions as Object 5, that if I try to place O5 on top of O4, I'll cause a collision.
           
           **Placement Strategy:** I'm planning to place Object 5 to the top-right of Object 4, to ensure zero collision. I am going to choose placements along a diagonal of the top right quadrant. I will define a safety region where object O5 can reside without any overlap, and then pick a few points within that region for each rotation angle.
           
           I've crafted a Python script to do this and ensure no overlap, it generates the positions and I will present that output as my placements.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for Surface 0 (ID 7)**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a new object (ID: 7) on Surface 0, avoiding collisions with two existing objects, Object 4 and Object 5.  Object 4 is in the bottom-left, Object 5 in the top-right, and their bounding boxes touch, forming a sort of diagonal partition of the surface.  This leaves very limited free space.
           
           I've determined that the best strategy is to place Object 7 at various angles, and for each valid angle, generate a few placement coordinates based on the valid ranges. Because the placement challenge is so constrained, I will concentrate on the 5 angles that give the largest placement space.
           
           *   **Region-Based Placement:**  The key insight is that because of how closely the existing objects are packed, the new object can't fit if its entire bounding box is outside the combined space. The only solution is to insert the object with placement zones that have a small x-span but a large y-span. By checking for the conditions of no overlap, I found that I need to place Object 7's center in two ranges:
               *   **Region A:**  The lower right corner of the surface to the center.
               *   **Region B:** The upper left corner of the surface to the center.
                   For each angle, there are ranges in the space of placement where those regions are valid and non-overlapping.
           
           *   **Angle Selection:**  Because the objects are nearly square, the rotations will not change the AABB dimensions of the new placement object in a notable way. I determined there are only 5 significant angles to place the object due to the previous constraints:
               *   0 degrees
               *   PI/12 (15 degrees)
               *   4PI/9 (80 degrees)
               *   5PI/9 (100 degrees)
               *   PI (180 degrees)
           
               I've computed the ranges of placement based on the effective widths. Now I can calculate the positions of each object.
           
           *   **Placement Generation:** For each selected angle, I'll calculate the bounds for Object 7's bounding box and calculate Region A and Region B ranges. For `theta = 0`, valid cx range is `[0.022995, 0.089473]` and `cy range is [-0.089473, -0.068058]`, and for Region B, the ranges switch. Once I have the ranges, I will create 10 placements. Each region can have the coordinates to ensure that they are diverse enough to fit the new requirements of 50 new placements.
