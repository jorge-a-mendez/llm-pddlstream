           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Revised Plan Summary: A Synthesis of Goals and Actions**
           
           The overarching goal is to satisfy the axiom `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to: both rovers must be in their starting locations, both rovers must be free, receivedimage for v17, v18, and v19, receive analysis from type v2 and type v6 rocks.
           
           I've determined a plan that ensures success. Here's the plan's breakdown.
           
           The plan employs two rovers, v12 and v14, which is the most effective approach I found for meeting all conditions and maximizing parallel activities given the constraints.
           
           Rover v12 moves to a configuration `#o3`, calibrates and takes images of objectives v17, v18, and v19. It then communicates the images by positioning itself in configuration `#o0`, and sending these images to the lander.  After communication is finished, v12 then goes to another config `#o5` in order to collect the necessary sampling and analysis of the rock of type v6. Then it communicates the sample back by returning to communication configuration `#o0` and returning analysis of that rock type, and then returns to its initial configuration.
           Rover v14 starts at it's starting config, and moves to location `#o5`, collects a sample from the rock v1, then moves to configuration `#o0` where it can communicate to the lander the needed analysis of the sampled rock, and after which, then goes back to it's original location.
           
           Importantly, each rover requires to return to their initial locations, and after processing all samples and images, they return. This ensures that the state of the system is the same as the axiom requirement.
           
           For this plan to work, I must specify the continuous parameters with the geometric parameters for the scenario. This results in the following:
           *   Conf `(v12, #o3)` is assigned coordinates, (0.5, 0.0), a configuration where v12 and v17 are within imaging distance and are in view, a requirement of `imagevisible`, and with minimal potential for collisions. The configuration is specified relative to `v17`.
           *   Conf `(v12, #o0)` is assigned the coordinate, (0.0, -1.0) for receiving `comvisible` of v9 and the lander.
           *   Conf `(v14, #o0)` is assigned the coordinate (-1.0, -1.0) for receiving `comvisible` of v9 and the lander.
           
           Therefore, this detailed plan with careful coordinate assignment will successfully meet the stated axiom.

(Thoughts: **Reframing for a Collision-Free Configuration**
           
           My analysis indicates a failure in the initial plan due to a collision. Specifically, the configuration `#o0` assigned to `v12` at `(0.0, -1.0)` was found to be in direct contact with the obstacle `v20`, a vertical barrier located at x=0.0. This is problematic, and therefore I need to find a new collision-free configuration that fulfills the necessary constraints.
           
           I need to re-evaluate the primary elements and constraints: `v12`'s initial position is `v13` at (1.0, -1.75). The lander, `v9`, is approximately centered at (-1.9, -2.0). The obstacle `v20` is a line segment, vertically positioned at x = 0.
           
           My goal is to find an updated configuration `#o0` for `v12` that meets the visibility requirement - `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`. In order to satisfy this, the rover, `v12`, needs to be within a distance of 4 units to `v9`. The previous `#o0` configuration `(0.0, -1.0)` was also found to be within that distance; however, that specific location directly collides with `v20`.
           
           In searching for a revised, acceptable configuration for `#o0`, several key criteria must be met: it must be free of collision with `v20` and any other potential obstacles, must remain within 4 units of `v9`, must be reachable from `v12`'s current location - either from the current configuration `#o3` or `v13`, and the line of sight to `v9` must be unobstructed by any obstacles.
           
           Considering `v12`'s `v13` position (1.0, -1.75) and `v9` approximately at (-1.9, -2.0), the obstacle `v20` presents a critical constraint at x=0. A point like `(0.5, -1.0)` would avoid `v20`. The distance check confirms that the new point meets the 4 unit constraint. I can therefore conclude that it is likely reachable from `#o3` and `v13`.
           
           As a result, `(0.5, -1.0)` meets the required constraints.
           
           As a side note, let's briefly review the other continuous values to ensure that those meet their constraints as well. The target `v17` located at (0.55, 1.90) and `#o3` for `v12` at `(0.5, 0.0)` is at a suitable distance. Furthermore, the distance from `v9` to `(-1.0, -1.0)` also meets the required criteria.
           
           With this analysis complete, it is determined that the plan structure should remain the same, but the specific continuous value for `#o0` for `v12` must change. Therefore, I will use `(0.5, -1.0)` as the new value.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Rethinking Reachability and Communication**
           
           Okay, so I've been given feedback that my previous configurations for rover `v12` were unreachable. I need to re-evaluate what's going on here. It seems like the constraints are tighter than I initially thought. I need to make sure I'm picking configurations that are *actually* reachable from the rover's starting positions while still satisfying visibility and communication requirements.
           
           The key is this: I need to find new coordinates for `#o3` and `#o0` for `v12` that are reachable. `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`, and its goal for `#o3` is to image `v17` (located at x=0.55). I previously tried `(0.5, 0.0)` for `#o3` (imaging) and `(0.5, -1.0)` for `#o0` (communicating). The obstacle, a wall at x=0, is clearly a factor, and my main issue is I was over-complicating.
           
           Since the reachability errors are for `x` values for `v12`, I need to keep x close to `1.0`. For `v12`, I'll use `(0.8, 0.5)` for `#o3` (imaging target) and `(-0.5, -1.5)` for `#o0` (comms) - this is crucial! This gives me better reachability.
           
           I also need to correct the plan for rover `v14`. I'll use `(-1.0, 1.0)` for imaging and `(-1.0, -1.0)` for communicating, these coordinates have been previously validated.
           
           **Revised Plan:**
           
           *   **Rover `v12`:**
               1.  Move to `(0.8, 0.5)` to image `v17`.
               2.  Sample `v5` (soil).
               3.  Move to `(-0.5, -1.5)` for communication.
               4.  Send the image of `v17`.

               6.  Drop the sample `v5`.
               7.  Return to its initial configuration.
           
           *   **Rover `v14`:**
               1.  Image `v18`.
               2.  Image `v19`.
               3.  Send the image for `v18`.
               4.  Send the image for `v19`.
               5.  Sample `v3` (stone).
               6.  Send analysis of `v3`.
               7.  Drop `v3`.
               8.  Return to initial configuration.
           
           This revised plan addresses the reachability constraints and ensures all the goals are met. Both rovers can move to locations for imaging and communication.

User:      Configuration #o3 = (0.8 0.5) for rover v12 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-0.5 -1.5) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base.

(Thoughts: **Plan Refinement Based on Feedback**
           
           Okay, so the initial plan was rejected. The main issue appears to be the reachability of configurations, especially across the `x = 0` obstacle, `v20`. The user's feedback makes it clear that the `motion` predicates are the *keys* to reachability. My goal is to *leverage* these predicates to create collision-free, occlusion-free, and distance-constrained plans.  I'm now assuming that the `motion` predicates imply *possible* paths, even if they appear to "cross" the wall. This lets me focus on *reasonable* coordinate choices.
           
           **Re-evaluating the Obstacle**
           
           The obstacle `v20` is a simple AABB wall along the line `x = 0`.  My previous analysis of this was correct, *in terms of classical obstacle avoidance.* But, I've got to take a different approach. The `motion` predicates let me assume the robots can somehow move *around* the wall and thus, I *don't* have to solve for a specific path *through* the obstacle itself.  My job is to find locations that satisfy all other constraints, and the `motion` predicates will ensure reachability.
           
           **Rover `v12` Plan Revision**
           
           *   **Imaging:** `v17` is still the target at `(0.505, 1.856)`. I need to be on the *right* side of the obstacle to see it.  My new candidate is `#o3: (0.8, 1.5)`. This ensures `v12` is in the correct position for imaging and that `#o3` is reachable via the provided `motion` predicates.
           *   **Sampling:** `v5` remains the soil sample location at `(0.35, -0.905)`. `#o5` I proposed at `(0.4, -0.7)` is good.
           *   **Communication:**  `v9` is at `(-2.405, -2.346)`. My new `#o0: (-1.0, -2.0)` *is to the left of the barrier*. The user's feedback suggests that `#o0` might not be reachable. Since the provided `motion` predicates include `motion(v12, #o5, #o2, #o0)`, I will proceed with this, assuming the low-level motion planning can find the necessary path (perhaps around the obstacle) across x=0. The distance and line-of-sight constraints are met with this choice.

           *   **Sampling:** I need to analyze `v3`, located at `(-0.674, 1.214)`.  My proposed sample location, `#o5: (-0.7, 1.5)` is fine.
           *   **Communication:**  I'm using the same `#o0: (-1.0, -1.0)`. As with Rover `v12`, I'm assuming that the `motion` predicate ensures `v14` can communicate with `v9` despite the implicit obstacle.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Revisiting Rover Configurations for Reachability**
           
           Okay, so the previous plan fell apart because I couldn't find reachable configurations for `v12` for both imaging and communication. I need to rethink these configurations while staying within the collision-free, occlusion-free, and distance constraints.
           
           **The Context:**
           *   `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)` (right side of the wall). It needs to:
               *   Image `v17` at `(0.505, 1.856)` (right side of the wall). Max distance of 2.
               *   Communicate with `v9` at `(-2.405, -2.346)` (left side of the wall). Max distance of 4.
           *   The wall, `v20`, is at `x=0`.
           
           **The Challenge:**
           The previous configurations, `(0.8, 1.5)` and `(-1.0, -2.0)`, were deemed unreachable. I need to deduce what "reachable" *actually* means. It seems to imply the internal planner has some limitations on traversing the environment. This might be related to either a limited movement range around the starting point or some constraints on the planned path. But I have `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o0)`, meaning it *can* cross the wall.
           
           **The Strategy:**
           Keep `v12` on the right side for imaging `v17` and then move to a reachable location on the left side for communication with `v9`.
           
           **New Configurations:**
           *   **For imaging `v17` (using `#o3`):**  Instead of `(0.8, 1.5)`, let's try `(0.7, 0.0)`. This keeps it right of `v20` and closer to the starting y-coordinate, but with line of sight to the target. Distance to v17 is 1.86, which is within the 2.0 max.
           *   **For communicating with `v9` (using `#o0`):** Instead of `(-1.0, -2.0)`, I'll use `(-1.5, -2.0)`. This keeps `v12` left of `v20`, but also closer to the target for communication. Distance to `v9` is 0.96, within the 4.0 max.
           
           **Summary of Changes:**
           *   `#o3` for `v12`: `(0.7, 0.0)`
           *   `#o0` for `v12`: `(-1.5, -2.0)`
           
           The coordinates for `v14` remain the same as the prior stage:
           *   `#o3` for `v14`: `(-1.3, 1.5)`
           *   `#o0` for `v14`: `(-1.0, -1.0)`
           
           **Re-Evaluating Plan Steps:**
           
           **Rover `v12`:**
           1.  Move to `#o3` (0.7, 0.0) to image `v17`.
           2.  Take the image of `v17`.
           3.  Move to `#o5` (sampling `v5`). I can assume `#o5` is reachable if I can travel in the direction of `v5` from the current location. So, it's sampling `v5`.
           4.  Sample `v5`.
           5.  Move to `#o0` (-1.5, -2.0) for communication.
           6.  Send image and analysis to the system.
           7.  Drop the rock.
           8.  Move back to starting point.
           
           **Rover `v14`:**
           1.  Move to `#o3` (-1.3, 1.5) to image.
           2.  Take images of `v18` and `v19`.
           3.  Move to `#o5` for sampling `v3`.
           4.  Sample `v3`.
           5.  Move to `#o0` (-1.0, -1.0) for communication.
           6.  Send data.
           7.  Drop the rock.
           8.  Move back to starting point.
           
           The order of events look appropriate. The key will be if the new coordinates for `v12` are considered "reachable".

Model:     **Revisiting Rover Configurations for Reachability**
           
           Okay, so the previous plan fell apart because I couldn't find reachable configurations for `v12` for both imaging and communication. I need to rethink these configurations while staying within the collision-free, occlusion-free, and distance constraints.
           
           **The Context:**
           *   `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)` (right side of the wall). It needs to:
               *   Image `v17` at `(0.505, 1.856)` (right side of the wall). Max distance of 2.
               *   Communicate with `v9` at `(-2.405, -2.346)` (left side of the wall). Max distance of 4.
           *   The wall, `v20`, is at `x=0`.
           
           **The Challenge:**
           The previous configurations, `(0.8, 1.5)` and `(-1.0, -2.0)`, were deemed unreachable. I need to deduce what "reachable" *actually* means. It seems to imply the internal planner has some limitations on traversing the environment. This might be related to either a limited movement range around the starting point or some constraints on the planned path. But I have `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o0)`, meaning it *can* cross the wall.
           
           **The Strategy:**
           Keep `v12` on the right side for imaging `v17` and then move to a reachable location on the left side for communication with `v9`.
           
           **New Configurations:**
           *   **For imaging `v17` (using `#o3`):**  Instead of `(0.8, 1.5)`, let's try `(0.7, 0.0)`. This keeps it right of `v20` and closer to the starting y-coordinate, but with line of sight to the target. Distance to v17 is 1.86, which is within the 2.0 max.
           *   **For communicating with `v9` (using `#o0`):** Instead of `(-1.0, -2.0)`, I'll use `(-1.5, -2.0)`. This keeps `v12` left of `v20`, but also closer to the target for communication. Distance to `v9` is 0.96, within the 4.0 max.
           
           **Summary of Changes:**
           *   `#o3` for `v12`: `(0.7, 0.0)`
           *   `#o0` for `v12`: `(-1.5, -2.0)`
           
           The coordinates for `v14` remain the same as the prior stage:
           *   `#o3` for `v14`: `(-1.3, 1.5)`
           *   `#o0` for `v14`: `(-1.0, -1.0)`
           
           **Re-Evaluating Plan Steps:**
           
           **Rover `v12`:**
           1.  Move to `#o3` (0.7, 0.0) to image `v17`.
           2.  Take the image of `v17`.
           3.  Move to `#o5` (sampling `v5`). I can assume `#o5` is reachable if I can travel in the direction of `v5` from the current location. So, it's sampling `v5`.
           4.  Sample `v5`.
           5.  Move to `#o0` (-1.5, -2.0) for communication.
           6.  Send image and analysis to the system.
           7.  Drop the rock.
           8.  Move back to starting point.
           
           **Rover `v14`:**
           1.  Move to `#o3` (-1.3, 1.5) to image.
           2.  Take images of `v18` and `v19`.
           3.  Move to `#o5` for sampling `v3`.
           4.  Sample `v3`.
           5.  Move to `#o0` (-1.0, -1.0) for communication.
           6.  Send data.
           7.  Drop the rock.
           8.  Move back to starting point.
           
           The order of events look appropriate. The key will be if the new coordinates for `v12` are considered "reachable".
           

User:      Configuration #o3 = (0.7 0.0) for rover v12 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-1.5 -2.0) for rover v12 at target v9 is in collision with the following fixed obstacles:
           
           ```
           v9: AABB(lower=[-2.4047, -2.3455502384913305, 0.0], upper=[-1.3952999999999998, -1.6544497615086693, 0.40766007847975994])
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Deployment Strategy**
           
           Okay, so the initial configurations for `v12` weren't quite right. I need to make some adjustments to ensure both reachability and collision-free movement. Let's see...
           
           First, for `v12`, the proposed configuration at `#o3` needed tweaking.  The previous `(0.7, 0.0)` for imaging `v17` was unreachable.  Given `v12`'s starting position at `(1.0, -1.75)` and the position of `v17`, I need a point that provides line-of-sight to the imaging target *and* that can be reasonably traversed from my starting location. I'm thinking a point like `(0.9, 0.5)` would work.  It's within a manageable distance, offers a clear line of sight, and is to the right of the wall.  This should be a workable solution.
           
           Secondly, the communication position `#o0` for `v12` with `v9`. The earlier `(-1.5, -2.0)` conflicted with the lander's AABB. I've re-evaluated that and proposed `(-2.0, -1.5)`. This placement should be *above* the lander, providing line-of-sight for communication.  Distance should be within the acceptable range, and, crucially, avoids collision.
           
           For `v14`, I'll keep the `(-1.3, 1.5)` for `#o3` imaging and `(-1.0, -1.0)` for `#o0` communications; these seem optimal.
           
           In brief, my revised plan is:
           
           **For Rover `v12`:** Traverse to `(0.9, 0.5)` for imaging of `v17`, then sample `v5`, move to `(-2.0, -1.5)` for sending data, and then return to starting.
           
           **For Rover `v14`:** Traverse to `(-1.3, 1.5)` for imaging `v18` and `v19`, then sample `v3`, move to `(-1.0, -1.0)` for sending data, and return to starting.
           
           I've ensured both robots can perform their tasks without colliding, all data transfer requirements are accounted for, and both are able to free up their stores at the end, returning to the pre-planned configurations.  The crucial unknown is still the explicit "reachability" rule, but I've ensured a geometrically sound traversal. Now, let's execute!
