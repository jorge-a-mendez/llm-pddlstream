           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Limited Action Instances**
           
           My goal is to achieve the state described by `new-axiom@0()`, which requires receiving images and analyses of certain objects. However, after carefully analyzing the available actions, the goal appears to be unreachable.
           
           The initial state reveals that I need to obtain `receivedimage` predicates for objectives `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`, as well as `receivedanalysis` predicates for specific rocks and soil types. To accomplish this, I must perform actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. Unfortunately, the "list of available action instances" provided exclusively contains `move` (which are no-ops) and `drop_rock` (which cannot be executed due to preconditions).
           
           The crux of the issue is the strict interpretation of the "list of available action instances" statement: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."  This strongly implies I can *only* use the explicitly listed action instances and not instantiate any others. If I were able to freely instantiate actions, then I could plan a strategy to move the rovers, take images and analyses, and send those data. However, the available motion predicates only assert that the rover can stay in their current configuration, which prevents me from reaching the needed configurations for these actions. 
           
           Since the required actions are not available, it is not possible to construct a plan that achieves the goal `new-axiom@0()`. The preconditions for those desired actions are never met, due to the motion restriction. Therefore, I must conclude that the goal is unreachable given the current constraints.
