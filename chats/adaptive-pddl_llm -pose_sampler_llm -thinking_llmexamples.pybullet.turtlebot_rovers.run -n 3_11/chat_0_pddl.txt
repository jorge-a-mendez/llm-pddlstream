User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning for Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, so I need to find three suitable locations for the robot's base near a target point, making sure the robot can "see" the target without running into anything. The target is at (2.1311, -0.0631), and the robot has to be within a distance of 2 from it. The environment's boundaries are defined as [-2.5, 2.5] for both x and y.
           
           First, I looked at the basic constraints: the robot's x coordinate should be roughly the same x-direction as the target (2.1311), and its x coordinate should be greater than the target to avoid being blocked by obstacles. The target point is close to the positive X-axis. After that I considered any static obstacles: a boundary box, a central vertical wall, and several scattered smaller ones.
           
           I considered a few key points: First, I needed to make sure the base wasn't too close to the target, as this would be redundant and limit the view angle, but it also has to be no greater than distance 2. Next, I took the target's coordinates and calculated the x-range and y-range.
           
           I then started thinking about candidate base locations, using some basic intuition and geometry. I started with a point "behind" the target (x-1.0) on the same y-coordinate. I then calculated a base to the side (y-1.0). I also added another base to the top right of the target (x+0.2, y+0.8), to add some diversity to viewing angles.
           
           I then had to check each of these potential base locations to ensure they were line-of-sight and within bounds. Specifically, I calculated the line-of-sight from each base to the target, and then considered the AABB's of all of the obstacles, I had to ensure that line segment does not intersect any of these obstacles.
           I double-checked to make sure that each position met the specified constraints.
           
           Finally, after verifying these positions were acceptable, I decided to go with those positions. Here they are:
           
           *   Base 1: (1.1311, -0.0631)
           *   Base 2: (2.1311, -1.0631)
           *   Base 3: (2.3311, 0.7369)
