           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Analysis of Goal Unreachability**
           
           I am faced with the goal of achieving `new-axiom@0()` within the `rovers` domain. After dissecting the axiom's structure, I determined that the crux of its satisfaction lies in establishing conditions like `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. These conditions hinge upon the actions `send_image` and `send_analysis`. A key roadblock has arisen due to the `blocked` axiom's structure, which introduces significant constraints.
           
           My analysis reveals that the `blocked` axiom, under a strict interpretation of the provided rules, creates a scenario where critical rays for imaging and communication are inherently blocked in the initial state. Because there are no `test-cfree-ray-conf-negative` facts, it is understood that the negation, `~test-cfree-ray-conf-negative`, is true by default. The `blocked` axiom depends on the conditions of a ray, a config, and `atconf`. Both rovers are at known configurations. Any `ray` in the problem is inherently blocked, leading to an impossible condition.
           
           Consequently, actions such as `take_image`, `calibrate`, and `send_image`, which require the negation of the `blocked` condition, cannot be executed. This prevents any realization of the `receivedimage` predicates and therefore, also the `receivedanalysis` goal, as they are dependent upon actions that are now unachievable.
           
           While alternative interpretations could potentially lead to a solution, the stated constraints and axiom definitions strictly imply that the goal is ultimately unreachable due to the initial blocking of necessary rays. Therefore, there is no plan.
