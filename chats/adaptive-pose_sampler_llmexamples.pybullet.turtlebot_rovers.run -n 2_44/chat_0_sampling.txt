           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5. There's a central vertical obstacle at x=0. There are also several smaller, scattered obstacles within the environment. I will try to place the robot in a clear area, avoiding the obstacles as best as I can, and also keeping in mind the max distance of 2 from the target point. I will choose points in different directions from the target to maximize diversity.

Model:     The previous target was (-1.95, 2.08).
           The position (1.5, 2.5) collided with the northern wall (obstacle 1). This is expected if the target is in the top left, a point in the top right will almost certainly collide.
           The positions (1.5, -1.5) and (-0.5, 0.5) had no line of sight. This suggests there are obstacles between these points and the target. Given the target is at (-1.95, 2.08), the central vertical obstacle at x=0 is likely blocking the view for (1.5, -1.5) and (0.5, 0.5), as well as other smaller obstacles. For this new target, I will try to stay on the same side of the x=0 barrier as the target. I will also try to vary the y-coordinate more, and consider positions closer to the target, but not so close as to collide with small nearby obstacles.

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The previous target was (0.62, 1.90).
           The position (-1.95, 0.5) had no line of sight, likely due to the central x=0 obstacle.
           The position (-2.2, 2.08) collided with obstacle 8, which is ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)). This means the position was too far left and close to that obstacle.
           The position (-1.0, 2.08) collided with obstacle 14, which is ((-1.25, 1.95), (-1.12, 2.09)). This also means the position was too far left and close to that obstacle.
           
           It seems I was trying to place the robot on the left side (negative x) for a target that is on the right side (positive x), near the x=0 barrier. The target (0.62, 1.90) is in the upper right quadrant, close to the central barrier at x=0. I will now try to keep positions on the positive x-side of the central barrier and consider positions slightly further away from the obstacles at y=2.5. I will also try to vary the y-coordinate significantly to explore more open spaces and avoid the dense cluster of obstacles in the upper left.
