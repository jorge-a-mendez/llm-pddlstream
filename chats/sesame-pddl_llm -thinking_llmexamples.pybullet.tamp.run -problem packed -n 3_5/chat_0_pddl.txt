           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've devised to achieve the goal of placing objects v8, v12, and v14 onto v16.**
           
           First, I analyzed the initial state and identified the key facts. My starting point is that I need to ensure all three objects end up at a specific pose, which I'll call #o2, on the target surface v16.  The given facts suggest that these objects are currently supported by a different surface (v11) and that I can grasp each object (v8, v12, v14) with a particular grasp (#o1).
           
           I need to move the robot base from its current configuration (v3) to a specific configuration (#o3) to execute pick and place actions, so the first action will be a move_base.  Based on my kinematic knowledge (kin facts), I can pick each object from its current pose (v9, v13, v15, respectively) using the available grasp (#o1). The relevant kinematics for pick and place are available.
           
           Since all three objects can be stacked on v16, and given that the system indicates that I'm targeting poses on that surface, I'll need to develop a sequential plan for the three objects (v8, v12, v14).  Here's the detailed plan I arrived at:
           
           1.  **Move the robot base** from its initial configuration v3 to the specified configuration #o3.
           2.  **Pick v8** from its current pose v9 using grasp #o1.
           3.  **Place v8** at the designated pose #o2, ensuring it's on v16 using grasp #o1.
           4.  **Pick v12** from its initial pose v13 using grasp #o1.
           5.  **Place v12** at the same designated pose #o2, on v16, also using grasp #o1.
           6.  **Pick v14** from its pose v15 using grasp #o1.
           7.  **Place v14** on v16 at the same designated pose #o2 using grasp #o1.
           
           Essentially, I'm performing a standard pick-and-place operation for each object, making sure to position them all on the target surface v16. It's key to interpret #o2 as a target pose on v16, suitable to place an object. No stacking is required by initial assumptions. I have assessed the action set of `move_base`, `pick`, and `place` for this purpose. I have also verified that the preconditions for these actions are all fulfilled. I believe this plan is sound and will achieve the specified goal. I also recognize that there are assumptions regarding safe trajectories, approaches, and poses, but given the provided information, I can proceed with the execution of my plan.
