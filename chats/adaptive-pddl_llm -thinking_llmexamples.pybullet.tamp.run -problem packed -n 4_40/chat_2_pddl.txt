           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Placement**
           
           My primary objective is to develop a plan that achieves the placement of four objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) onto a designated surface (v18). The core principle for successful placement, as defined by the axioms, hinges on two conditions: the target object must be supported by the desired surface and it must be situated in the correct pose.
           
           Analyzing the initial state, I see that these objects are currently supported by v11 and positioned at their respective poses (v9, v13, v15, and v17). The goal requires these to be supported and posed at v18. Importantly, they are also graspable objects, ready for manipulation. The robot, equipped with two arms (v4 and v6), has both arms free, and its base is at v3. The relevant `kin` facts indicate v4 has actions for the current objects.
           
           I've determined that placing an object requires getting the base to position #o3 for the grasping motions. The `supported` facts indicate that v8, v12, v14, and v16 *can* be placed on v18 *if* they are at pose #o2. To facilitate this, the initial plan necessitates a base movement from v3 to #o3 via `move_base`.
           
           The plan involves a sequence of pick-and-place actions: picking each object from its initial location on v11 and placing it onto v18 at pose #o2. The arm v4 is selected for this task, as it contains all required kinesthetic actions. The assumption is that picking and placing the objects sequentially doesn't pose issues since the continuous planner's constraints and the assumptions in the problem domain are valid. I checked that pre and postconditions are met.
           
           After ensuring that move base is correct, the steps of the plan consist of:
           1.  **Move the robot base from its initial configuration (v3) to #o3 using `move_base`.**
           2.  **Pick v8 using arm v4 from pose v9.**
           3.  **Place v8 on v18 at pose #o2.**
           4.  **Pick v12 using arm v4 from pose v13.**
           5.  **Place v12 on v18 at pose #o2.**
           6.  **Pick v14 using arm v4 from pose v15.**
           7.  **Place v14 on v18 at pose #o2.**
           8.  **Pick v16 using arm v4 from pose v17.**
           9.  **Place v16 on v18 at pose #o2.**
           
           All actions, when executed in this particular order, should, to the best of my current knowledge, achieve the desired goal given the existing `kin` facts and assumptions, without running into any conflicts or state deadlocks.
