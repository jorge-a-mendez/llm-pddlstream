               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `on(v8, v18)`, `on(v12, v18)`, `on(v14, v18)`, and `on(v16, v18)`.  Initially, these objects are all on `v11`.  My thought process starts by analyzing the current state.  I can see the locations of all the objects and that the robotic arms, `v4` and `v6`, are both "handempty".  I have base and arm configurations, and all the required objects are graspable and stackable. My understanding is that, I will have to pick up the objects using robot arms and place them on `v18`.
           
           Now, the instructions are crystal clear:  I can only utilize the provided actions.  The *only* action instance I'm given is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This action, essentially, is a null operation.  It consumes `canmove()` and sets it. It does not affect any `atpose` predicates, which are crucial for changing the `on` predicate.
           
           To achieve my goal, I'd need to manipulate the `on` predicate for each object to be `on(?, v18)`. Since `on` is derived from `supported` and `atpose`, I need to change the `atpose` of these objects. This is where the problem lies.
           
           The provided action instance is a `move_base` action, a no-op that does nothing. It does not allow me to use any `pick` or `place` operations that are necessary to manipulate `atpose` and achieve the goal. No `pick` or `place` actions are listed as valid in the given list of available action instances.
           
           Considering the action instances list, the goal is unachievable given the limitations and available actions. It's a non-starter.
