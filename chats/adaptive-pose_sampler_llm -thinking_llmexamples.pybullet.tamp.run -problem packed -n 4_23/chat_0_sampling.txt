(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to provide 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0, which is a square.  I need to ensure the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) is fully contained within the surface's AABB for stability.  The object's dimensions are `(0.08936621188540461, 0.08936621188540461)`, meaning it's a square. The surface is also a square, spanning from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           First, I recognized that since it is a square the effective dimensions do not change with rotation. This means that at any angle the square's AABB will always be (0.08936621188540461, 0.08936621188540461).
           
           To maximize placement diversity, I determined the appropriate stable ranges for X and Y coordinate positions for the square in each rotation. Then, I identified two distinct AABB dimensions that can be achieved. I identified the AABB dimensions by solving for `effective_x` and `effective_y` at any angle of rotation. For rotations of 0, pi/2, pi, and 3pi/2, the square's AABB dimensions remained the original value of `0.08936621188540461`.
           
           I then applied the same method for the rotation values of pi/4, 3pi/4, 5pi/4, and 7pi/4. The dimensions of the square's AABB in these rotations had dimensions of `0.126388`. I then solved for the ranges for stable positions in x and y coordinates.
           
           I created two grids of x,y positions. The first grid used rotations of 0, and the second, pi/4. I created a 5x5 grid and used those coordinates with each of the two rotation values for each of 25 unique positions in total. This process ensured a diverse set of valid, stable placements across two primary rotations, meeting the requirement for 50 placements.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement for Object ID 4**
           
           Alright, let's break down how I'm going to determine a good placement for object ID 4, given its size and the need to avoid collision with object ID 5, which is already situated. Object 5 is located at approximately (-0.135, -0.135) and has dimensions of (0.089, 0.089).
           
           My core strategy revolves around a grid-based approach combined with careful consideration of different object orientations.
           
           First, I precisely calculate the AABB of object 5 to use for collision detection. Object 5 neatly occupies the bottom-left corner of the surface at (0, 0, -0.09) with a size of approximately (0.089, 0.089), resulting in an AABB from roughly (-0.135, -0.135) to (-0.0456, -0.0456). I’ll use these precise bounds to avoid overlap with object 4. The whole surface is from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           Now, object 4 is a square with an edge length of 0.094. I'll consider four main orientations (0, pi/4, pi/2, and pi/8 radians).
           
           For each orientation, I calculate the effective dimensions of the object (including considering its rotation), determine the valid range of the center position, and then figure out the precise boundaries of the collision zone. The collision zone is where the center of object 4 can’t be because it'll overlap with object 5's AABB.
           
           To ensure a diverse set of placements, I'll generate a 5x5 grid of points within the valid space for each angle (but avoiding that collision zone). With the grids calculated, I’ll test each center point for a collision.
           
           I’ll choose 50 points total, with roughly equal points (13) from orientations 0 and pi/4, and smaller amounts from pi/2 and pi/8. This balanced approach will yield a collection of 50 non-colliding points covering various positions and orientations that are likely to be stable and suitable for object 4.

(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Placing Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 6) on surface 0, making sure it doesn't collide with two existing objects: Object 5 and Object 4.  These objects are already placed and I have all their dimensions, positions, and bounding boxes calculated.
           
           First, I define my working parameters. I calculate the half-extents for object 6, based on the `s6` value (0.09471). Since object 6 is a square, I will test placement at 4 different orientations: 0, pi/4, pi/2, and 3*pi/4 radians.
           
           For each orientation, I establish a valid region where the center of object 6 can be. It has to be within the surface boundaries.  Then I compute the collision boxes around objects 4 and 5, using their AABBs and half extents. The collision boxes for object 6's *center* are calculated by expanding the existing bounding boxes for Objects 4 and 5 by the *object 6's* half extents. 
           
           The strategy is simple: generate a grid of points within the valid center region and discard any point inside either of the collision regions around objects 4 and 5, since those are invalid positions. Each center (x,y) coordinates gets translated to a unique placement for the `theta` orientation.  
           
           I can easily generate valid positions, then. I start with the orientation `theta = 0`. The calculations proceed like this:
           
           I determined that 10 good points are possible for the `theta=0` setting, then repeat that same grid and set `theta` = pi/2. Then I moved to `theta = pi/4` setting, where I found 16 unique points, plus an additional 16 points for `theta = 3*pi/4` (These were valid points as well).  These points are detailed below.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable locations for a square object (ID 7) on a square surface (0.27 x 0.27) while avoiding collisions with three previously placed objects (IDs 4, 5, and 6).  I'll place object 7 with the given dimensions (`s7 = 0.0772`), using several different rotations.
           
           **Placement Logic:**
           
           1.  **Define the Surface:** The surface is a square centered at (0,0).
           2.  **Define Object 7:**  I have the size and shape for object 7.
           3.  **Define Obstacles:** I have the locations and shapes of the three existing objects (4, 5, 6), all square.  I've pre-calculated their AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) to simplify collision detection.
           4.  **Rotation Strategy:**  To get a good variety of placements, I'll test object 7 in rotations of 0, pi/8, pi/4, and  pi/2, and 3pi/8 radians (0, 22.5, 45, 67.5, and 90 degrees).
           5.  **Placement Grid:** I'm using a 5x5 grid of potential center points for each of the 5 rotations.
           6.  **Collision Checks:** For each candidate position (x, y) on the grid, I'll calculate the AABB of object 7 and check for overlaps with the AABBs of objects 4, 5, and 6.
           7.  **Calculating Collisions:** To check if AABBs overlap, I use a simple overlapping range check for both X and Y axes. If the ranges overlap, then the two AABBs have collided.
           8.  **Surface Limits:** To generate candidate placements on each axis, I account for the size of object 7 and its rotation to determine the minimum and maximum boundaries for where its center can be on the surface, ensuring the whole object remains inside the surface.

Model:     **Summary of My Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable locations for a square object (ID 7) on a square surface (0.27 x 0.27) while avoiding collisions with three previously placed objects (IDs 4, 5, and 6).  I'll place object 7 with the given dimensions (`s7 = 0.0772`), using several different rotations.
           
           **Placement Logic:**
           
           1.  **Define the Surface:** The surface is a square centered at (0,0).
           2.  **Define Object 7:**  I have the size and shape for object 7.
           3.  **Define Obstacles:** I have the locations and shapes of the three existing objects (4, 5, 6), all square.  I've pre-calculated their AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) to simplify collision detection.
           4.  **Rotation Strategy:**  To get a good variety of placements, I'll test object 7 in rotations of 0, pi/8, pi/4, and  pi/2, and 3pi/8 radians (0, 22.5, 45, 67.5, and 90 degrees).
           5.  **Placement Grid:** I'm using a 5x5 grid of potential center points for each of the 5 rotations.
           6.  **Collision Checks:** For each candidate position (x, y) on the grid, I'll calculate the AABB of object 7 and check for overlaps with the AABBs of objects 4, 5, and 6.
           7.  **Calculating Collisions:** To check if AABBs overlap, I use a simple overlapping range check for both X and Y axes. If the ranges overlap, then the two AABBs have collided.
           8.  **Surface Limits:** To generate candidate placements on each axis, I account for the size of object 7 and its rotation to determine the minimum and maximum boundaries for where its center can be on the surface, ensuring the whole object remains inside the surface.
