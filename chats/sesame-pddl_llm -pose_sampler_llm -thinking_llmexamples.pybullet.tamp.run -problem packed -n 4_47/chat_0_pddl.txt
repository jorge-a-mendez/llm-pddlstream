(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements**
           
           I need to generate 50 stable placements for an object with ID 6 and dimensions approximately 0.095m x 0.095m on a square surface of side 0.27m centered at (0, 0). The primary concern is ensuring the object remains entirely within the surface boundaries, regardless of its rotation.
           
           First, I define the bounding box for the object after it's been rotated. I know that for a rotation `theta`, the rotated half-width `hw_rot` and half-height `hh_rot` can be calculated, taking into consideration the object's dimensions and the trigonometric functions of the angle. Since the object is nearly square, the change in effective dimensions due to rotation is minimal.
           
           The surface boundaries are -0.135 to 0.135 for both x and y. So I need to shift these bounds by `hw_rot` and `hh_rot` for safety. To find the largest shift, I calculate the `hw_rot` and `hh_rot` at pi/4, where they reach their maximum. This yields a half-width of approximately 0.067, or a valid placement range of approximately -0.068 to 0.068.
           
           For diverse placements, I create a range of x and y coordinates from -0.06 to 0.06 to ensure each (x, y) coordinate falls within a safe zone, meaning any placement will be stable regardless of the object's orientation. I also generate a variety of orientations (theta values) that are uniformly distributed between 0 and 2*pi, ensuring diverse angular positioning of the object within each safe placement.
           
           I then combine the (x, y) grid and theta values to generate a sequence of 50 unique surface placements for object ID 6.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Placing Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've got a successful placement for object 6 at (0, 0, -0.06, -0.06), which is useful information. I need to keep that in mind when I place object 5. Object 5 is square, with dimensions 0.0916 x 0.0916, and the surface it's going on has the bounds [(-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)]. That gives me a valid range for the center (x, y) of object 5 as [-0.089, 0.089].
           
           Now, I'm trying to generate 50 stable, collision-free placements for this object. Given that object 6 is already placed and its dimensions, I know it occupies the approximate region [-0.107, -0.0127] x [-0.107, -0.0127]. My primary goal here is to ensure the new placements *don't* overlap this region.
           
           My initial thought is to place object 5 in an area further from (-0.06, -0.06).  I figured, based on object 6's size and half-extent calculations, that object 5's center needs to be greater than 0.0331 on either the x or y axis to avoid collision. So I tried using a 3x3 grid centered in that space.
           
           I considered a safe region where its AABB's minimum x coordinate is greater than object 6's AABB's maximum x coordinate, or similar for y. Object 5 needs to have its center's x coordinate > 0.0331 OR center's y coordinate > 0.0331. With this non-collision strategy, I constructed a grid in the top-right quadrant, generating an array for each axis, using values [0.04, 0.06, 0.08], giving me 9 x,y coordinates and corresponding combinations, but only getting 9 * (angles=3) = 27 total permutations. So, I will be adding pairs to create the required 50.
           
           I'll also keep in mind that I'm also going to assign a rotation theta, ranging from 0 to 2*pi, generating a combination of 16 different rotations (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2...).
           
           To ensure good coverage, I will generate a 9x9 grid, where the axis values are -0.08, -0.06, -0.04, -0.02, 0.0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08.  This gives me 81 possible (x, y) coordinates for object 5. The only issue is collision between the two objects.
           
           I calculated that the pairs must obey x > 0.0331 or y > 0.0331. I will filter the (x, y) pairs: x>= 0.04 or y>=0.04.  By using a simple check, I can generate 45 stable (x, y) coordinates for object 5 that does not collide with object 6.
           
           To generate the full 50, I can use a simple strategy. I will use the first 45 (x,y) pairs with a rotation of 0. Finally, I can use the first 5 (x, y) pairs, and apply a rotation theta of pi/2.

(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for Object 4**
           
           Alright, I need to figure out where to place this new object (ID 4) on Surface 0.  The goal is 50 stable placements, but I can't let it collide with the existing objects, ID 6 and ID 5. 
           
           First, I looked at the surface dimensions.  Surface 0 is a square,  `-0.135` to `0.135` in both X and Y.  Object 4 is almost a square itself (dimensions about 0.081).  I can rotate Object 4, so I need to account for that.
           
           The key is figuring out the maximum extent of Object 4 in any direction, even when rotated. Since it's nearly square, the worst-case scenario is at 45 degrees, which gives me a max extent of about `0.057`.  To stay within the bounds of Surface 0, Object 4's center needs to be within about `[-0.0776, 0.0776]` in both X and Y.
           
           Now for collision avoidance! I have the AABBs for the existing objects.  Object 6 is in the bottom-left, roughly from `[-0.107, -0.012] x [-0.107, -0.012]`.  Object 5 is in the bottom-middle/right, roughly from `[-0.005, 0.085] x [-0.125, -0.034]`. I can use a more precise collision check for each candidate position.
           
           My approach is to create a grid of possible (X, Y) coordinates within the valid surface range for Object 4. I will loop over various angles. For each grid point and angle, I will check whether Object 4 in that location (and with that rotation) would collide with either object 6 or object 5. The basic AABB collision logic will check if their boxes are intersecting. Finally, I make sure the placement is stable by verifying it is within the bounds.
           
           To find more diverse and robust placements, I have decided to increase the angular resolution to use 8 rotations between 0 and pi. Furthermore, to get a denser filling of the usable surface, I will increase the spacing resolution. Then iterate to find 50 valid placements.

(Thoughts: **I've got a challenge: find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 7) on Surface 0, avoiding collisions with three existing objects (ID 6, 5, and 4).**  Surface 0 is a rectangular area of (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  The new object is a perfect square, so its size and therefore its half-extent are constant, regardless of the rotation.
           
           **First, I need to understand the constraints:**  The object's center must be within Surface 0 minus its half-extent (about +/- 0.087). Next, I calculate the Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) of the existing objects. I calculated the precise AABBs for each of the objects, at each object's stated theta, and stored them.  This involves calculating the AABB, or a rectangular box that contains the object at a given theta.
           
           **Now, the collision checks:**  I define a function to check if the new object, given a center (x, y) and an angle, overlaps the AABB of any existing object. For this square object, things simplify because its AABB size doesn't change with rotation.
           
           **I've set up a grid search:**  I generate a dense grid of points within the feasible (stable) area on Surface 0, checking a range of evenly spaced angles (theta) at each point.  The grid will provide various placement options for a stable position. After running through the grid, I'll filter out the ones that overlap with an existing object.
           
           **I improved the search:** I expanded the density of the grid search using NumPy's linspace function to find the valid x, y coordinate pairs for the object's center point.  I have also ensured that the algorithm generates a sufficient number of possible solutions, which will be easily returned to the user.  The algorithm will return the 50 first solutions it generates, or fewer if the search does not yield that many non-colliding results. The valid x/y centers are contained in Surface 0 (minus an offset for object size), and are checked against a range of possible thetas to find valid stable placements for the object. The `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)` tuples will be returned as the final solution.

Model:     **I've got a challenge: find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 7) on Surface 0, avoiding collisions with three existing objects (ID 6, 5, and 4).**  Surface 0 is a rectangular area of (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  The new object is a perfect square, so its size and therefore its half-extent are constant, regardless of the rotation.
           
           **First, I need to understand the constraints:**  The object's center must be within Surface 0 minus its half-extent (about +/- 0.087). Next, I calculate the Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) of the existing objects. I calculated the precise AABBs for each of the objects, at each object's stated theta, and stored them.  This involves calculating the AABB, or a rectangular box that contains the object at a given theta.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement for ID 7**
           
           I'm being asked to find 50 stable placements for Object 7 (a square) on Surface 0, avoiding collisions with *objects of different IDs* (4, 5, and 6), but not necessarily with *previous placements* of Object 7 itself. My analysis of the surface and object properties is as follows:
           
           1.  **Surface and Object Information:** Surface 0 is defined by the range `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. Object 7 is a square with dimensions `(0.0957, 0.0957)`, and its half-extent is `0.0478`.
           
           2.  **Stability Conditions:** For the square object to be stable, the center `(x, y)` must lie within the bounds: `x` between `-0.0871` and `0.0871`, and `y` between `-0.0871` and `0.0871`.
           
           3.  **Obstacle Identification:** I need to avoid three fixed obstacles:
               *   Object 6: Placed at `(0, 0, -0.06, -0.06)` with dimensions `(0.0945, 0.0945)`.
               *   Object 5: Placed at `(0, 0, 0.04, -0.08)` with dimensions `(0.0916, 0.0916)`.
               *   Object 4: Placed at `(0, 0.0, -0.077, -0.077)` with dimensions `(0.0811, 0.0811)`.
           
               I will use AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) for each object as the collision detection tool.
           
           4.  **Placement Logic:** Given my new interpretation of the task, I will now use a grid sampling approach to propose coordinates for placement.
           
           *   To generate diverse placements, I have decided to consider a grid within the valid stable area for Object 7.
           *   I will set x from `-0.087` to `0.087`, with step as 0.01, and similarly for y.
           *   I'll consider the rotation angle `theta` as `0`, `pi/4`, `pi/2`, and `3*pi/4`.
           *   Then, for each candidate, I will check for collision only against obstacles 4, 5, and 6 and propose coordinates with the proper rotation if not in collision.
           *   The final result must contain 50 tuples (surface_id, rotation, x, y) as proposed.
