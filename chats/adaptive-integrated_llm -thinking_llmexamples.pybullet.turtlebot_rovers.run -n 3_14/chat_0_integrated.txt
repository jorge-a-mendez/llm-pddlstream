           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunction of several facts. I see that I'm starting with a few facts already satisfied: `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, and `free(v14, v16)`. However, the other elements of the conjunction - specifically those involving `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` - are not initially satisfied.
           
           My primary approach to these `receivedimage` goals is to leverage the `send_image` action. The preconditions for `send_image` direct me to take images and then ensure those images are sent. I've noted that I have to take pictures of objectives `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` using mode `v11`.
           
           I see that `take_image` is a requirement. However, this is where the constraint kicks in. The actions available to me are limited to `move` actions and `drop_rock`. I have no ability to actually take pictures or analyze rocks using the actions that are provided. This is a fatal flaw.
           
           Further analysis reveals that the available move actions are self-loops; the rovers stay put at their original configurations (`v13` and `v15`). There are no `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicates present to permit the robots to take or send images within these constraints. Also, the `drop_rock` action isn't helpful, because it requires that the rovers are full, which is false in the initial state.
           
           Also, I have to ensure that `receivedanalysis` predicates are satisfied, which means I need to `send_analysis` after I have taken rock samples. But this goes against the constraints of the allowable action instances.
           
           Essentially, there is no way, with the limited set of actions available, to achieve the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` parts of the goal. It's a closed system, and the initial state, combined with the given action set, renders the `new-axiom@0()` goal unattainable. Therefore, there is no valid plan.
