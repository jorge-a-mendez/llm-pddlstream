           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning to Achieve Multiple "On" Goals**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all "on" `v16`. In other words, I need to pick them up from their current locations, and put each of them down onto `v16`.
           
           Initially, all three objects are supported by `v11`, but they aren't on `v16`. We also need to get the robot arm into position. We have our arm and hand at the ready.
           
           Based on the setup, I'm thinking the following:
           1.  Move the robot's base configuration to be able to pick up and place objects.
           2.  Pick up `v12` from its current spot (supported by v11), and place it on `v16`.
           3.  Pick up `v8` from its current location, and place it at the same pose on `v16`.
           4.  Finally, pick up `v14` from where it is and place it at that same pose on `v16`.
           
           Now, the trick here is knowing where to place the objects on `v16`. It looks like the system has identified a specific pose for all three objects.  It seems that `#o2` is a pre-calculated pose on `v16` that satisfies the supporting properties for each object. We need to be able to place the objects in that spot. I need to make sure I take the initial base configuration, then pick up and place each object. The planner should be able to produce the trajectory information and appropriate configurations for my plan to execute.
           
           So, that's the plan. Let's execute and see how it works!
