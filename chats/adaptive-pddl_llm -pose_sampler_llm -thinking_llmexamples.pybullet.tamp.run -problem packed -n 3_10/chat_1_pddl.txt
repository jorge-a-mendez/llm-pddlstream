               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning about Goal Achievability**
           
           My primary objective is to devise a plan to satisfy the goal: objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` must be supported by `v16`. I recognize that achieving this necessitates placing these objects onto `v16`. Initially, I analyze the present state: `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are currently `on` `v11`, supported by `v11`.
           
           The robot has two arms and is 'handempty'. The available `kin` facts suggest that the robot *could* pick and place these objects, provided it has the necessary actions. The actions would be `pick` from the current location and `place` on `v16`.
           
           The constraint is that only the given action instance `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` is allowed.  This severely restricts my available actions.  This action instance does not directly affect the `atpose` of any objects.
           
           My initial thought was a sequence: pick `v8`, place on `v16`, then `v12`, then `v14`, and finally `v16`. However, I have to satisfy the problem requirement that only the given action instance is allowed. I must strictly abide by this.
           
           I verify the preconditions for `place`:  `kin`, `atgrasp`, `atbconf`, and safety checks. For `pick`, it's similar: `kin`, `atpose`, `handempty`, `atbconf`, and safety.  Crucially, these require the use of continuous parameters which are *not* defined in the allowable action instance.  The continuous parameters are *implied* by the `kin` facts, but I have no way to *specify* them.
           
           The crucial point is that I cannot use any `pick` or `place` action instances. The only tool I have is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which does *nothing* towards achieving the goal, which is `on` `v16` for each object.
           
           Therefore, under the given constraints, this goal is *unachievable*.  I am blocked by the action restriction.
