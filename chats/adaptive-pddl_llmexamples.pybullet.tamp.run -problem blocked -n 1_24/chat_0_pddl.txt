           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes several objects, `v8`, `v12`, and `v15` as graspable and stackable. `v6` and `v4` are arms. There are also various poses, grasps, and configurations defined. The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true. Looking at the initial state, we know that `type(v8, v17)`, `type(v12, v17)`. The goal axiom uses `?green`, which means any object that satisfies the `on` and `type` predicates. So if `on(v8, v18)` is true, or `on(v12, v18)` is true, the goal will be satisfied.
           
           From the initial state, we have `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`. This means `v8` is on `v11`. We need to move `v8` to `v18`.
           We have `atpose(v12, v13)` and `supported(v12, v13, v14)`. This means `v12` is on `v14`. We need to move `v12` to `v18`.
           We have `atpose(v15, v16)` and `supported(v15, v16, v11)`. This means `v15` is on `v11`.
           
           The only action available is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not change the `on` predicate. Since none of the `on` predicates can be changed to achieve `on(?green, v18)`, and neither `v8` nor `v12` are initially on `v18`, the goal is not achievable. This is because there are no pick and place actions available in the action instances list.
           
           The goal is not achievable with the given action instances, as there are no actions to move objects to different locations (i.e., no `pick` or `place` actions are available). The only allowed action is `move_base`, which doesn't affect the location of objects.
