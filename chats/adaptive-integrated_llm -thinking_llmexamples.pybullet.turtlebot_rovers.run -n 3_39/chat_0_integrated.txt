           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Thought Process:**
           
           I'm tasked with devising a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`. First, I break down the axiom, recognizing that I need to ensure three `receivedimage` predicates are true, along with `receivedanalysis` for any rocks of types v2 (stone) and v6 (soil).  I confirm that the initial state satisfies several conditions in the goal (like `atconf` and `free`). The immediate challenge lies in achieving `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`.
           
           Looking at the available actions, I only have `move` (no-op) and `drop_rock`. This immediately raises a red flag. These actions cannot achieve `receivedimage` (requiring `send_image` and `take_image`) or `receivedanalysis` (requiring `send_analysis` and `sample_rock`). These essential actions for image and analysis operations aren't available, which suggests the goal is unachievable with the provided actions.
           
           I then carefully re-examine the goal's structure and the initial state. I consider whether the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates might somehow be derivable from existing information or implicitly satisfied. However, after a thorough review, I find no supporting facts or axioms that would lead to these predicates being true without explicit image-taking and analysis-performing actions.
           
           I also address the possibility of misinterpreting the axiom concerning rocks of types v2 and v6. Typically, I'd understand this to mean all rocks of these types.  I examine several possible interpretations, but the conclusion remains unchanged: I need specific actions for image-taking and analysis, which are not in the list of valid actions.
           
           After an exhaustive analysis, I'm forced to conclude the goal is unreachable.  The available actions are insufficient to modify the state to satisfy `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`, which are necessary to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` goal. The lack of crucial image and analysis actions makes the problem unsolvable. I am certain that a plan does not exist to achieve the goal using the available actions.
