           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with the goal of achieving `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunction of several atomic predicates. My initial analysis shows that some predicates are already satisfied in the initial state. The crux of the problem lies in achieving `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates for specific rocks and soil types.
           
           My initial thought was to break this down by figuring out the sequence of steps, which would be: use `take_image` and `send_image` for images and `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` for analyses. I realized that the actions needed aren't present in the available list.
           
           The available actions are just `move` and `drop_rock`. The moves are no-ops since they are moving to the same spot, and `drop_rock` can't even be taken. The really tight constraint here is "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           Given this constraint, the goal becomes unachievable. `receivedimage` requires `send_image`, and `receivedanalysis` requires `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`. None of these are in the list. Without these actions, I cannot modify the state to satisfy the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates, thus making the goal unreachable. The list of allowed actions just does not contain what I need to accomplish the goal. Therefore, with the present constraints, there is no valid plan.
