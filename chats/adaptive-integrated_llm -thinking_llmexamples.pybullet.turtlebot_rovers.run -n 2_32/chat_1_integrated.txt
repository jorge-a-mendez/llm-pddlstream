           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Planning**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, but really, it boils down to getting two rovers to achieve a few things. Rover A (v14) and Rover B (v12) both need to take a picture and send it, and they each need to analyze a rock and send those results too. The challenge is, they all need to be achieved simultaneously.
           
           I see that some initial conditions are true. Namely, `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, and `free(v14, v16)`. The goal asks to satisfy the axiom given the above. The solution is already within the space as provided.  So, I can plan how I will solve it with the rovers.
           
           I can make a plan for each rover that will follow the sequence given. They'll need to move to a configuration, calibrate the camera, take a picture, move to a comms configuration, send the image, move to a sampling configuration, collect a rock sample, move back to the comms config, send the analysis, and then return to their initial config.
           
           **Object Identification and Action Sequence**
           
           Based on the goal and initial state, v12 will process soil and v14 will process stone, and they both need to return to the initial positions, to satisfy the `atconf` predicates.
           
           I'll start with v14:
           1. `(move v14 v15 #o2 #o3)`
           2. `(calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)`
           3. `(take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)`
           4. `(move v14 #o3 #o2 #o0)`
           5. `(send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11)`
           6. `(move v14 #o0 #o2 #o5)`
           7. `(sample_rock v14 #o5 v4 v16)`
           8. `(move v14 #o5 #o2 #o0)`
           9. `(send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v4)`
           10. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`
           11. `(move v14 #o0 #o2 v15)`
           
           For v12, my plan is:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 #o3)`
           2. `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10)`
           3. `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11)`
           4. `(move v12 #o3 #o2 #o0)`
           5. `(send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11)`
           6. `(move v12 #o0 #o2 #o5)`
           7. `(sample_rock v12 #o5 v5 v16)`
           8. `(move v12 #o5 #o2 #o0)`
           9. `(send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v5)`
           10. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`
           11. `(move v12 #o0 #o2 v13)`
           
           **Configuration Details**
           
           Okay, here's where the rubber meets the road. I need to define the positions for the configurations starting with '#'. I will provide values for each rover to satisfy the predicates to have clear paths and line of sight.
           
           **Comm Configuration #o0:**
           
           *   **Rationale:** Comms need to be established with the lander. The lander position is approximately (-1.9, -2.0).
           *   **Rover v12:** I will use coordinates (-0.5, -1.8)
           *   **Rover v14:** To satisfy `atconf(v14, v15)` as a final state, and since the lander is in range of v15, I will use (-1.0, -1.70)
           
           **Image Configuration #o3:**
           
           *   **Rationale:** These need to be close to the objectives for taking images.
           *   **Rover v12, Target v18:** I will use the coordinates (-0.41, 0.0)

           I'll start with v14:
           1. `(move v14 v15 #o2 #o3)`
           2. `(calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)`
           3. `(take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)`
           4. `(move v14 #o3 #o2 #o0)`
           5. `(send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11)`
           6. `(move v14 #o0 #o2 #o5)`
           7. `(sample_rock v14 #o5 v4 v16)`
           8. `(move v14 #o5 #o2 #o0)`
           9. `(send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v4)`
           10. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`
           11. `(move v14 #o0 #o2 v15)`
           
           For v12, my plan is:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 #o3)`
           2. `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10)`
           3. `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11)`
           4. `(move v12 #o3 #o2 #o0)`
           5. `(send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11)`
           6. `(move v12 #o0 #o2 #o5)`
           7. `(sample_rock v12 #o5 v5 v16)`
           8. `(move v12 #o5 #o2 #o0)`
           9. `(send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v5)`
           10. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`
           11. `(move v12 #o0 #o2 v13)`
           
           **Configuration Details**
           
           Okay, here's where the rubber meets the road. I need to define the positions for the configurations starting with '#'. I will provide values for each rover to satisfy the predicates to have clear paths and line of sight.
           
           **Comm Configuration #o0:**
           
           *   **Rationale:** Comms need to be established with the lander. The lander position is approximately (-1.9, -2.0).
           *   **Rover v12:** I will use coordinates (-0.5, -1.8)
           *   **Rover v14:** To satisfy `atconf(v14, v15)` as a final state, and since the lander is in range of v15, I will use (-1.0, -1.70)
           
           **Image Configuration #o3:**
           
           *   **Rationale:** These need to be close to the objectives for taking images.
           *   **Rover v12, Target v18:** I will use the coordinates (-0.41, 0.0)
           

User:      Configuration #o0 = (-0.5 -1.8) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (-0.41 0.0) for rover v12 at target v18 is in collision with the following fixed obstacles:
           
           ```
           v19: AABB(lower=(-0.6266069197266972, 0.02183025244775654, 0.00100000500679015), upper=(-0.5045056558043086, 0.14393151637014506, 0.40100000500679017))
           ```
           
           Configuration #o3 = (1.0 1.0) for rover v14 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Addressing Invalid Continuous Configurations & Refining the Plan**
           
           My initial pass at the configurations hit some snags. The suggested positions for communication and imaging weren't always reachable or caused collisions. Now, I must find new, valid placements.
           
           Specifically, the lander at `v9` needed a new communication point for rovers `v12` and `v14`. Objective `v18` had imaging issues with `v12`, while objective `v17` gave `v14` problems. I've re-examined the coordinates for each object and am now aiming for a revised strategy:
           
           1.  **Reachable Configurations:**  Rovers `v12` and `v14` have starting points at `v13` and `v15` respectively. Movement is restricted, so keeping new configurations relatively close to their start positions is crucial. I'm focusing on "reasonable" distances for a single "move" action.
           
           2.  **`#o0` (Communication) Configuration for `v12` and `v14`:**
               *   The lander's center is approximately `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
               *   The suggested `(-0.5, -1.8)` was unreachable. I will place `v12` and `v14` closer to each other near the lander. The suggested point for `v12` `(-0.5, -1.8)` seems too far. I'm choosing `(-1.0, -1.75)` for `v12`. Distance to the lander is reasonable and the position fits the starting range.
               *   I'll try `(-1.5, -1.75)` for `v14`.
           
           3.  **`#o3` (Imaging) Configuration for `v12`:**
               *   The goal is to image objective `v18` approximately at `(-0.4, 1.88)`.
               *   The earlier `(-0.41, 0.0)` for `v18` collided with obstacle `v19`. I've analyzed that a good location, for reachability and obstacle avoidance, is `(-0.4, 0.5)`. This avoids the obstacle and stays within image range.
               *   Distance from the initial point will be `2.65`. The previous location was `2.79`, so this is likely within range.
               *   This might still be too large a distance for a single `move` action.
           
           4.  **`#o3` (Imaging) Configuration for `v14`:**
               *   Target is objective `v17` at approx `(2.07, 1.89)`.
               *   I'm currently stuck at `(0.0, -0.5)`. The other previous choice `(1.0, 1.0)` was out of reach. The rover needs to go right, which seems out of range and far from the start location. 
               *   I am considering switching the task and letting `v12` image `v17` instead, given the difficulty with `v14`.
           
           5.  **Plan Restructuring:**
               *   `v12` is to image `v17` (using `#o3: (1.5, 0.5)`), sample `v5`, send image, analyze, drop the sample, and return.
               *   `v14` will image `v18` (with new imaging point `(-0.4, 0.5)`) send image, sample `v4`, send analysis, drop the sample, and return.
               *   The new order appears to work better in terms of distance.
           
           **Revised Configurations:**
           
           *   `#o0` for both rovers to lander is near each rover's initial position.
           *   `#o3` location for `v12` is near `v17`.
           *   `#o3` for `v14` will be near `v18` now.
           
           The actions are now re-ordered and tested.
           
           I am more confident in the plan's feasibility with these adjustments.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating Continuous Parameters: A Detailed Look**
           
           Okay, so I need to revisit the configurations for both rovers, *v12* and *v14*, to address the issues of reachability, collision avoidance, and ensuring the targets are within the necessary communication and imaging ranges. The feedback indicates the previous attempts were problematic, so a fresh approach is necessary.
           
           My primary concern is the "reachable" condition.  The distance between the current and proposed configurations needs to be small enough for a single "move" action.  I estimated around 2 to 2.3 units as acceptable, but smaller movements would be better to avoid triggering the "not reachable" error. I'll need to use more direct paths.
           
           For *v12*, its initial position is `(1.0, -1.75)`.  For *v17* imaging, I initially tried a location that was too far away. So, I will focus on a configuration closer, like moving to `(1.5, 0.0)`. Distance from start: ~1.82 units, and distance to `v17`: ~1.97 units. Then, for the communication with *v9*, I'll use a configuration of `(0.0, -1.75)`. The distance from the starting point is reachable, and the proximity to *v9* is within the acceptable range.
           
           For *v14*, starting at `(-1.0, -1.75)`, my configuration for imaging *v18* will be `(-0.7, 0.0)`. This gives a distance of ~1.77 units to reach the new location and ~1.90 units to the target. For the communication with *v9*, I will choose the location `(-1.0, -2.0)`. This position is outside of *v9*'s bounding box and ensures collision avoidance. It is also within the bounds of the "reachable" criteria.
           
           I must also ensure the robots are outside of *v19*, checking the calculated values of `#o3` and ensuring the x-coordinates are not within `v19`'s `x` AABB values. The configurations chosen fulfill the range and collision avoidance requirements.
           
           The sequence of actions, with the revised coordinates for *#o0* and *#o3* appears to be effective and logically consistent.

(Thoughts: **Rethinking the Rover's Trajectory: A New Plan Emerges**
           
           The previous plan fell short due to reachability and collision problems. I need to re-evaluate the four key configurations: two for communication and two for imaging.
           
           **Rover V12's Strategy**
           
           V12, starting at (1.0, -1.75), must both image v17 and communicate with v9. The obstacle, v20, blocked communication to v9 at (0.0, -1.75). I moved V12 left to (-0.5, -1.75) for better communication to v9. Distance: 1.42 units, well within range. Reachability from the start position of v12 (1.0, -1.75) to the communication point (-0.5, -1.75) is easily 1.5. No collision.
           
           Then, the imaging point to reach v17 (2.07, 1.89) was not reachable. I'm exploring new imaging positions. (1.5, 0.5) had reachability of about 2.3, this is the issue. I am now trying (1.7, 0.0), a distance of 1.92 units, which is within range, and will not collide. This seems to work.
           
           **Rover V14's Course**
           
           V14, initially at (-1.0, -1.75), must image v18 and communicate with v9. I attempted a point at (-1.0, -2.0) for communication but this failed due to reachability. My new approach places it closer to v14's origin at (-0.9, -1.75), an even smaller distance of 0.1 for reachability, and will not collide.
           
           Moving on to imaging v18 at approximately (-0.4, 1.88) and avoiding an obstacle, I had to adjust from (-0.7, 0.0).  A new position at (-1.0, 0.0), now within 2 units, is collision-free and works for imaging, with no collision at `v19`.
           
           **Plan Verification**
           
           The proposed plan adheres to the structure. Rovers can complete tasks. The calculations are correct. Let's send it.

           The proposed plan adheres to the structure. Rovers can complete tasks. The calculations are correct. Let's send it.
           

User:      Configuration #o0 = (-0.5 -1.75) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-0.9 -1.75) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (1.7 0.0) for rover v12 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (-1.0 0.0) for rover v14 at target v18 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Obstacles and Constraints**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. We're tasked with achieving a goal that requires rovers to gather images and analyses, then send them to a lander. Sounds straightforward, but there are some critical geometric constraints at play here.
           
           First, we need to consider that the environment has a significant obstacle, a wall at `x=0` (v20), that effectively divides the space.  We have two rovers: v12 starts at `x = 1.0` and v14 starts at `x = -1.0`. The wall prevents the rovers from crossing this divide, so v12 can *only* move to configurations where x > 0, and v14 must stay where x < 0.
           
           Now, let's look at what we're trying to achieve:
           
           *   **Imaging and Analysis:** We need images of two objectives (v17 and v18) and analyses of two rocks (v4 and v5).
           *   **Communication:** All images and analyses need to be sent to a lander (v9).
           
           The challenge is that the lander, the rocks, and one of the objectives are all in the 'negative x' side of the environment. This means the rover v12 cannot communicate with the lander. The rover v14 can accomplish the imaging of `v18` and take samples of `v4` and `v5` because they are on the same side. However, the rover v12 cannot send the image of `v17` because the wall at `x=0` prevents communication with the lander. So the critical element of the communication makes the `receivedimage(v17, v11)` impossible.
           
           Given these constraints, achieving the overall goal (`new-axiom@0()`) is impossible, because `receivedimage(v17, v11)` cannot be done.
