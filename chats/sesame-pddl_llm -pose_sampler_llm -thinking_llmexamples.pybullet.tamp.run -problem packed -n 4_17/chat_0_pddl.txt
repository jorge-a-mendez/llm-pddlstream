(Thoughts: **Stable Object Placement Strategy**
           
           My primary goal is to determine 50 stable placement configurations for an object (ID 4) on a given surface (Surface 0). This object is a square with an axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) of 0.09842... x 0.09842... units. The surface is a 0.27 x 0.27 square centered at (0,0).
           
           Since the object's dimensions are provided as its AABB dimensions, I need to consider how rotation affects the usable area. A square's AABB doesn't change with rotation. The maximum extent of the AABB would be sqrt(2) * the base dimension, which I will not use because the prompt mentions AABB which is the dimension given. So I need to calculate the *available* space on the surface.
           
           The usable area on the surface for the object's center depends on the object's AABB.  By considering all possible rotation angles from 0 to pi/2, I can generate a diverse set of stable placements. The AABB dimensions and surface boundaries will restrict the placement of the center.
           The center can range from `-0.085...` to `0.085...` when theta = 0, and from `-0.065...` to `0.065...` when theta = pi/4. I will pick the range of values for various angles.
           
           I've decided to use a combination of rotation angles and grid-based center positions to create a diverse set of stable placements. The rotation angles are set to `0`, `pi/10`, `pi/5`, `3*pi/10`, `2*pi/5`, `pi/2`. For each angle I'll ensure I can place `8` or `9` placements.  I've selected specific x and y coordinates that will work given these bounds to generate a 3x3 grid centered in the middle of each range. I'm carefully taking only the appropriate amount (8 or 9) placement coordinates per angle.  This results in a total of 50 stable placements, ready for output.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: A Detailed Analysis**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of my thinking to place these objects, given my expertise in this area. My goal is clear: get 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 5) on a defined surface, while avoiding any collisions with the existing object (ID 4).
           
           First, let's establish the scene. I have the surface bounds, which I understand perfectly – it's a square region.  The new object is a square of a given size.  The key here is that the object 4 is already in place. Its dimensions, position, and orientation are known. I need to take these into account to ensure object 5 doesn't overlap it.
           
           My approach is systematic: I'll vary the object's orientation (theta) across a range, and for each rotation, I'll calculate the valid positions (x, y) for the object's center.  Since I'm dealing with a square object, I'll only need to consider theta values from 0 to pi/2, as that covers all unique orientations. I will try to space the points evenly.
           
           The size of the square object changes the allowable center positions. I need to calculate the effective half-extents (half_L_eff) of the new object given its size and rotation. This part is a geometry problem that I can easily solve. Surface boundary defines the region where object center can lie, plus the requirement that object 5 cannot collide with obj4. To prevent this, I need to know the safe region for the object's center relative to existing object's position.
           
           Here's the critical bit: I will compute the region that the object 5 *center* must stay away from to avoid a collision. The general collision principle is I avoid the overlap of the object's AABB.  By considering a padding of the objects and ensuring the centers are a certain distance away, I guarantee this.  For each rotation, this gives me valid (x,y) locations.
           
           The region where this collision might occur is a rectangle centered at Object 4's coordinates. I need to add a padding that accounts for Object 5's dimensions in whatever orientation. The goal will be to pick a number of candidate points, and filter the ones that cause collisions.
           
           Since this method might result in empty regions due to Object 4's location, I'm going to adopt a hybrid approach: I compute a dense grid of points, exclude the points that collide, and for remaining regions (which form an L-shape) I'll adopt a strategy to pick points that cover the space well.  I am trying different approaches. The first will have an upper region and a right side region. Each region will have its corresponding candidate set of x, y.
           
           To ensure I have enough valid points, I've got a contingency plan: if I can't generate the required points, I'll add the necessary "fallback" placement in the upper-right region of the surface.  This fallback strategy is a measure of last resort. I have a guarantee the region is well-placed since both objects are squares, so the code is correct. The goal is the pick a place that's definitely empty.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of a New Object (ID 6)**
           
           My task is to find 50 stable locations for a new, square object (ID 6) on surface 0, avoiding collisions with two existing objects (ID 4 and ID 5) which are fixed.
           
           **Key Constraints and Strategies:**
           
           *   **Surface Geometry:** The placement surface (0) is a square: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           *   **Collision Avoidance:** I need to prevent collisions with Object 4 (centered at approximately `(-0.077, -0.077)` with a side of `0.098`) and Object 5 (centered at approximately `(-0.076, 0.063)` with a side of `0.095`).
           *   **Rotations:** I will test a range of orientations (`theta`) for the new object: 0, π/10, π/5, 3π/10, 2π/5, and π/2. The AABB box must be re-calculated for each theta.
           *   **Safe Region Calculation:**  For each rotation, I'll determine the new object's effective bounding box (AABB) using the formula `s_6/2 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. I'll consider the surface bounds.
           *   **Collision Detection:** I will use a conservative AABB check with a small buffer (`epsilon = 1e-6`) to prevent objects from even touching. A placeement `(x, y, theta)` is valid if its AABB does not overlap with existing obstacles.
           *   **Point Generation:** A grid of points within the valid surface area is created and the points that cause a collision are removed.
           *   **Placement Distribution:** A point is sampled at a regular grid to determine the possible valid points.  I have set the number of points for each `theta`.
           
           **Implementation and Checks:**
           
           1.  I have calculated the bounds of Object 4, approximately x: `[-0.1264, -0.0280]` and y: `[-0.1264, -0.0280]`.
           2.  I have also calculated the bounds of Object 5, approximately x: `[-0.1237, -0.0283]` and y: `[0.0157, 0.1111]`.
           3.  The side of the new square object, s_6 = `0.09891`.
           4.  For theta = 0, the available range for x and y center of the new box is [-0.0855, 0.0855].
           5.  A set of conditions has been created.  To avoid a collision with an existing obstacle, the center position's x or y coordinate must be larger than a calculated position for each object.
           6.  For theta = 0, if the center of new object is x > 0.0211 or y < -0.0337, this would prevent a collision with existing object 5.
           7.  The final step will be to test the generated points to ensure they do not overlap.
