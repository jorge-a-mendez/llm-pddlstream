           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**
           
           Alright, the objective is to satisfy the axiom `new-axiom@0()`, a task that translates to several sub-goals: capturing images from three specific locations (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`) using a mode identified as `v11`, analyzing two distinct rock samples (`v1` and `v5`) and transmitting these results.
           
           Crucially, the initial setup includes two rovers: `v12` and `v14`. Both rovers possess cameras (`v10`) capable of operating in mode `v11`, and each is equipped with a storage container (`v16`). The plan must also adhere to the precondition that rovers can only have one rock sample at a time. The environment is considered static, and all of the preconditions are known.
           
           **Strategic Considerations and Rover Assignments**
           
           Two rovers are available, enabling concurrent actions (parallelization). `v14` will be responsible for image acquisition, and `v12` will conduct the rock analyses.
           
           **Image Acquisition Strategy for `v14`**
           
           The plan must achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)` and has to use the initial `imagevisible` predicates.
           
           1.  Move the rover `v14` to configuration `#o3`.
           2.  Calibrate the camera (`v10`) for each target:
               *   `v17`
               *   `v18`
               *   `v19`
           3.  Execute each `take_image` action after calibration.
           4.  Move to `#o0` for communication, where `comvisible` is already true and a config (#o0) is defined.
           5.  Transmit images from `#o0` to `v9` (the lander).
           
           **Rock Analysis and Transmission for `v12`**
           
           1.  `v12` navigates to configuration `#o5` to sample rocks.
           2.  Sample rock `v1`. This is rock type `v2`.
           3.  Move the rover to `#o0`.
           4.  Transmit the analysis of `v1` to `v9`.
           5.  Return to `#o5`.
           6.  Drop sample `v1`.
           7.  Sample `v5`, a rock of type `v6`.
           8.  Move back to `#o0`.
           9.  Transmit the analysis of `v5`.
           10. Return the rover to its initial configuration.
           
           **Initial Conditions and Continuous Value Assignments**
           
           The plan explicitly states that the rover needs to return to its initial config, and the constraints state that all rovers have to. To satisfy these conditions, the rovers are made to go back to their starting position. The configurations for image visibility and communication have been assigned and are valid.
           
           Therefore:
           
           *   For `imagevisible` and `comvisible`, the configurations `#o3` and `#o0` are given in the initial conditions, so I need to provide values for these locations to satisfy the task. I will assume they are valid locations.
           *   The continuous values that I must assign are to `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`.
           *   All `motion` predicates are provided, so they must have motion for these actions.
           *   For the `#o3` configuration, a single configuration is needed that is in visual range.
           *   Given the problem description and geometric constraints, a single ray *must* exist for each `imagevisible` target for `v14` and `v12`.
           
           **Continuous Values for Configurations**
           
           *   `#o0` (comms config, for both rovers to communicate with `v9`): `(-1.0, -2.0, 3.14159/2)`
           *   `#o3` (imaging config, for `v14` to capture images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19`): `(0.1, 2.0, -1.57)`
           *   `#o5` (sampling config, for `v12` to sample `v1` and `v5`): `(0.45, -0.925, 0.0)`
           
           **Finalized Plan**
           
           The initial conditions need to be satisfied at the end state for the task. The final plan adds return trips for each rover.
           
           **Rover v14 (initial at v15):**
           
           1.  `(move v14 v15 #o2 #o3)`
           2.  
)

Model:     **Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**
           
           Alright, the objective is to satisfy the axiom `new-axiom@0()`, a task that translates to several sub-goals: capturing images from three specific locations (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`) using a mode identified as `v11`, analyzing two distinct rock samples (`v1` and `v5`) and transmitting these results.
           
           Crucially, the initial setup includes two rovers: `v12` and `v14`. Both rovers possess cameras (`v10`) capable of operating in mode `v11`, and each is equipped with a storage container (`v16`). The plan must also adhere to the precondition that rovers can only have one rock sample at a time. The environment is considered static, and all of the preconditions are known.
           
           **Strategic Considerations and Rover Assignments**
           
           Two rovers are available, enabling concurrent actions (parallelization). `v14` will be responsible for image acquisition, and `v12` will conduct the rock analyses.
           
           **Image Acquisition Strategy for `v14`**
           
           The plan must achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)` and has to use the initial `imagevisible` predicates.
           
           1.  Move the rover `v14` to configuration `#o3`.
           2.  Calibrate the camera (`v10`) for each target:
               *   `v17`
               *   `v18`
               *   `v19`
           3.  Execute each `take_image` action after calibration.
           4.  Move to `#o0` for communication, where `comvisible` is already true and a config (#o0) is defined.
           5.  Transmit images from `#o0` to `v9` (the lander).
           
           **Rock Analysis and Transmission for `v12`**
           
           1.  `v12` navigates to configuration `#o5` to sample rocks.
           2.  Sample rock `v1`. This is rock type `v2`.
           3.  Move the rover to `#o0`.
           4.  Transmit the analysis of `v1` to `v9`.
           5.  Return to `#o5`.
           6.  Drop sample `v1`.
           7.  Sample `v5`, a rock of type `v6`.
           8.  Move back to `#o0`.
           9.  Transmit the analysis of `v5`.
           10. Return the rover to its initial configuration.
           
           **Initial Conditions and Continuous Value Assignments**
           
           The plan explicitly states that the rover needs to return to its initial config, and the constraints state that all rovers have to. To satisfy these conditions, the rovers are made to go back to their starting position. The configurations for image visibility and communication have been assigned and are valid.
           
           Therefore:
           
           *   For `imagevisible` and `comvisible`, the configurations `#o3` and `#o0` are given in the initial conditions, so I need to provide values for these locations to satisfy the task. I will assume they are valid locations.
           *   The continuous values that I must assign are to `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`.
           *   All `motion` predicates are provided, so they must have motion for these actions.
           *   For the `#o3` configuration, a single configuration is needed that is in visual range.
           *   Given the problem description and geometric constraints, a single ray *must* exist for each `imagevisible` target for `v14` and `v12`.
           
           **Continuous Values for Configurations**
           
           *   `#o0` (comms config, for both rovers to communicate with `v9`): `(-1.0, -2.0, 3.14159/2)`
           *   `#o3` (imaging config, for `v14` to capture images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19`): `(0.1, 2.0, -1.57)`
           *   `#o5` (sampling config, for `v12` to sample `v1` and `v5`): `(0.45, -0.925, 0.0)`
           
           **Finalized Plan**
           
           The initial conditions need to be satisfied at the end state for the task. The final plan adds return trips for each rover.
           
           **Rover v14 (initial at v15):**
           
           1.  `(move v14 v15 #o2 #o3)`
           2.  

User:      Configuration #o0 = (-1.0 -2.0 1.570795) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (0.1 2.0 -1.57) for rover v14 at target v17 is in collision with the following fixed obstacles:

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Repositioning for Success**
           
           I've hit a roadblock with the initial plan. Unreachable and collision-prone configurations are plaguing the continuous parameters, specifically `#o0` (communication) and `#o3` (imaging). I need to re-evaluate the object locations and obstacles, particularly those troublesome thin-walled obstructions.
           
           I've re-analyzed the obstacles and object locations: v20 is a thin wall or line segment along x=0, and v21 is a rectangular obstacle in the top-right quadrant. Rover v12 starts at (1.0, -1.75, 3.142) and v14 starts at (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0), with the lander v9 located in the bottom-left.
           
           The previous communication configuration, `-1.0, -2.0, 1.570795`, proved problematic for rover v12. The distance from -1.0, -2.0 to (1.0, -1.75)  was too far. A quick evaluation of comvisible (max range 4)  led to a communication spot for v14 near (-1.5, -2.0) reachable from v15, within range of the lander, and within com range of v14. To overcome the com problem with the existing plan, I've re-envisioned the comms and I will have rover v14 handle all image sending and v12 handle all analyses.
           
           The problematic imaging configuration for v14 at (0.1, 2.0, -1.57), was due to the collision with the x=0 wall (v20). Given the constraints, a single imaging configuration for v14 to see the three objectives v17 (2.1, 2.0), v18 (-1.9, 2.0), and v19 (-0.5, 1.87) is impossible as the x=0 obstacle is in the line of sight for imaging. Since it is implied to use `#o3`, as the action instances have #o3, I had to revise my imaging strategy. After carefully rereading the plan, it became clear I could provide different configuration for #o3. Thus, I've defined ` #o3_v14_v17_img`, `#o3_v14_v18_img`, `#o3_v14_v19_img` to overcome the occlusion of obstacles.
           
           The last parameter, #o5, the sampling configuration value was fine. Reaching out with a single 'above' location for sampling was already provided and no collision was present.
           
           The plan structure now shifts the focus of the rovers to these key configurations. Rover v14 will perform a series of moves-image-calibration actions based on ` #o3_v14_v17_img`, `#o3_v14_v18_img`, `#o3_v14_v19_img`.  v12 will move between sampling and communications actions. I must ensure the motion actions are exactly as provided. The plan and object values have been revised and I am ready.
           
           I have included the correct format of the configurations and listed the object names. The resulting plan is detailed in order of rover tasks and the key continuous parameter.

(Thoughts: **My Action Plan for Rover Deployment**
           
           Alright, after reviewing the feedback and the task at hand, I need to devise a new plan to achieve the `new-axiom@0()` goal, taking into consideration the obstacles, the rover's initial positions, and the reachability constraints. I've broken down the problem into these core components:
           
           **Rover `v14` & Imaging:**
           
           *   **Imaging Locations (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`):**  I need to get `v14` (starting at `(-1.0, -1.75)`) to image three areas: `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`. I've calculated potentially suitable configurations for each imaging step, aiming to avoid collisions and ensure that they are reachable and within the rover's camera range. The key here is to keep `v14` far enough away from the obstacle `v22` when imaging `v17`. After initial attempts failed, for imaging `v17`, I've selected `(1.7, 1.7, 0.0)` which I'll test. Then I've targeted `(-1.7, 1.7, 3.14)` for imaging `v18` and `(-0.5, 1.5, 1.57)` for imaging `v19`. After imaging, I need a safe point to communicate with `v9` so I've calculated `(-0.5, -2.0, 3.14)` to communicate with the lander.
           
           **Rover `v12` & Sample Collection:**
           
           *   **Sampling Rocks (`v1`, `v5`):** `v12` (starting at `(1.0, -1.75)`) needs to collect samples from two rocks: `v1` (stone, type `v2`) and `v5` (soil, type `v6`). Since these are separate targets, I must calculate each target `above` location. Based on reachability, I'm setting a location `(-1.0, -0.5, 1.57)` and `(1.8, -1.5, 0.0)` for the configurations needed for collection of the rocks. Then, I set the com location to be `(0.75, -2.0, 3.14)` for v9.
           **Detailed Actions:**
           
           1.  **Rover `v14`:** The rover starts at `v15` and will move to, calibrate, and take an image, send this image, and repeat for all three targets. At the end, I need v14 to return to `v15` which satisfies the required axioms.
           2.  **Rover `v12`:** I need `v12` to move to the sample locations, collect and send samples, and then return.
           
           **Key Considerations:**
           
           *   **Obstacle Avoidance:** I've meticulously checked for collisions with obstacles, especially the wall along the y-axis, the block, and the lander itself.
           *   **Reachability:**  I've ensured that each configuration is reachable from the rover's starting or previous position.
           *   **Communication:** All communication (with the lander, `v9`) must occur from a configuration that allows a clear signal.
           *   **Axioms:** I confirmed that all the initial state axioms, after the plan runs, will still be present and true in the end state.
           
           This plan should provide a solution and satisfy the goals while also adhering to the given initial state. I'm ready to proceed with implementing this plan, and I am confident that it addresses all the identified issues and constraints.

(Thoughts: **Correcting Plan Typos and Ensuring Valid Moves**
           
           Okay, I've got to make sure the plan is kosher, specifically those `move` actions. The previous round flagged some errors: the argument order in `motion` was off, and I had some typos. Now, I need to stick to the pattern `(move <rover> <q1> #o2 <q2>)`, where the `q` configurations either start in the initial state or are these `#` objects defined via `conf` predicates.
           
           I took a peek at the list of allowed `move` actions. For instance, `v12` has moves between different configurations (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`), and so does `v14`. Those invalid actions I mentioned? They were because I used `#o3` or `#o5` in places where I needed `#o2`, which defines the trajectory.
           
           The good news is, the configurations themselves *should* be alright since the earlier error messages were about trajectory, not reachability (I think!). I'll just keep the configs but fix the PDDL syntax for the `move` actions.

           Here's the re-written plan with the corrected `move` action syntax.

           **Rover `v12` (starts at `v13`):**
           1.  `(move v12 v13 #o2 #o5)`
           2.  `(sample_rock v12 #o5 v1 v16)`
           3.  `(move v12 #o5 #o2 #o0)`
           4.  `(send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v1)`
           5.  `(move v12 #o0 #o2 #o5)`
           6.  `(drop_rock v12 v16)`
           7.  `(move v12 #o5 #o2 #o5)`
           8.  `(sample_rock v12 #o5 v5 v16)`
           9.  `(move v12 #o5 #o2 #o0)`
           10. `(send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v5)`
           11. `(move v12 #o0 #o2 #o5)`
           12. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`
           13. `(move v12 #o5 #o2 v13)`
           
           **Configuration Details and Continuous Values**
           
           The trickier part is the configurations.  I have to be careful when using `#o3` and `#o5`. The problem statement says I need to provide continuous values if I have multiple rover-target pairs with the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicates. This means that I can use a name, like `#o3`, multiple times, but the system understands that each usage can have different continuous values if that pair is different. So, when I use `#o3` for `v17`, `#o3` for `v18`, and `#o3` for `v19`, it's not the same configuration even though it

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating Rover Configurations**
           
           Alright, let's dive back in. The feedback is in: those initial configurations were a no-go. Collisions, unreachable spots – the usual suspects. I need to rethink the continuous parameters (#o0, #o3, #o5) for both rovers, especially keeping those pesky obstacles in mind: the wall at x=0 (v20), the rectangle at (0.5, 2.0) (v21), v22, v23, and v24, and of course, the lander v9.

           *   **Imaging `v18` (at (-1.9, 2.0)):** (1.7, 1.7, 3.14) collided! Let's try (-1.5, 1.0, 2.356). Distance of approx. 1.07. Clear.
           *   **Imaging `v19` (at (-0.56, 1.87)):** Previous position was not reachable. Going to try (-0.5, 1.0, 1.57). Distance to this config is approx. 0.87. Clear.
           *   **Comms with `v9`:** The original (-0.5, -2.0, 3.14) was a no-go. I can go for (-1.5, -1.5, 3.14) instead. Good range at approx. 0.64.

           *   **Sampling `v5` (at (2.0, -1.9)):** Last sampling config at (1.8, -1.5, 0.0) seems reasonable and well clear. Let's keep it.
           *   **Comms with `v9`:** Need to be reachable from sampling spots.  (0.5, -1.5, 3.14) should work. Distance of about 1.3 from v5 and 1.8 from v1 samples.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Plan: A New Approach**
           
           I'm revisiting the plan because the initial configurations for imaging and communication were problematic, colliding with obstacles or being unreachable. My goal remains `new-axiom@0()`, but I must adapt to the constraints. I'm focusing on finding valid configurations for both rovers, *v12* and *v14*, while carefully avoiding the known obstacles: walls, a lander, and various other objects at different locations.
           
           For rover *v14* (starting at (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)):
           
           *   **Imaging Target *v17* (near (2.1, 2.0)):** I'm aiming for (0.8, 1.5, 0.36). This puts *v14* to the right of the x=0 wall, clearing the path, and within the 2-unit image range. This looks promising.
           *   **Imaging Target *v18* (near (-1.9, 2.0)):** I'm thinking of (-1.0, 1.5, 2.6). This should be a reachable position near to the target.
           *   **Imaging Target *v19* (near (-0.56, 1.87)):** I'll try (-0.5, 1.5, 1.73). This seems reachable and within the image range.
           *   **Communication with *v9*:** I'm suggesting (-0.8, -1.75, 3.38), very close to the starting position of v14, therefore reachable.
           
           For rover *v12* (starting at (1.0, -1.75, 3.142)):
           
           *   **Target *v1* (Stone):** The previous proposed location, (-1.0, -0.5, 1.57), still seems valid and should be reached from the starting position.
           *   **Target *v5* (Soil):** I'll keep the previously used (1.8, -1.5, 0.0), it should still be okay.

Model:     **Re-evaluating the Plan: A New Approach**
           
           I'm revisiting the plan because the initial configurations for imaging and communication were problematic, colliding with obstacles or being unreachable. My goal remains `new-axiom@0()`, but I must adapt to the constraints. I'm focusing on finding valid configurations for both rovers, *v12* and *v14*, while carefully avoiding the known obstacles: walls, a lander, and various other objects at different locations.
           
           For rover *v14* (starting at (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)):
           
           *   **Imaging Target *v17* (near (2.1, 2.0)):** I'm aiming for (0.8, 1.5, 0.36). This puts *v14* to the right of the x=0 wall, clearing the path, and within the 2-unit image range. This looks promising.
           *   **Imaging Target *v18* (near (-1.9, 2.0)):** I'm thinking of (-1.0, 1.5, 2.6). This should be a reachable position near to the target.
           *   **Imaging Target *v19* (near (-0.56, 1.87)):** I'll try (-0.5, 1.5, 1.73). This seems reachable and within the image range.
           *   **Communication with *v9*:** I'm suggesting (-0.8, -1.75, 3.38), very close to the starting position of v14, therefore reachable.
           
           For rover *v12* (starting at (1.0, -1.75, 3.142)):
           
           *   **Target *v1* (Stone):** The previous proposed location, (-1.0, -0.5, 1.57), still seems valid and should be reached from the starting position.
           *   **Target *v5* (Soil):** I'll keep the previously used (1.8, -1.5, 0.0), it should still be okay.
           *   **Communication with *v9*:**  For this purpose, I plan to move *v12* to (0.8, -1.75, 3.23), a position close to the start.
           
           All chosen configurations seem plausible, and I'll use unique names for each (*#o0\_v14\_v9*, etc.) to avoid any confusion and facilitate the plan execution. The PDDL actions will still use the generic `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`, but the specific continuous values will be clearly defined and linked to the corresponding actions.
