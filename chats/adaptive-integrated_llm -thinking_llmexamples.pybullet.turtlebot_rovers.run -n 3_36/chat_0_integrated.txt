           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a goal dependent on satisfying several conditions: `atconf`, `free`, `receivedimage`, `type`, and `receivedanalysis`. Examining the initial state, I see that the `atconf` and `free` conditions are already met. The real hurdles are achieving `receivedimage` for three objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`) and `receivedanalysis` for at least one stone and one soil sample.
           
           **The Action Plan & Its Limitations**
           
           To get those images, I need to take images, and to take images, I need the rovers to be at a specific configuration with line of sight. Likewise, to get the analysis, the rovers have to sample the rock. This requires the rovers to be at a specific location to sample, and then another location to send the analysis. This plan relies heavily on the `move`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions.
           
           However, here's the critical snag: the problem *specifically* limits the actions I can use. I'm given a list of *valid action instances*, and I'm told explicitly that "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           **The Conundrum of Limited Actions**
           
           The "list of valid action instances" primarily concerns the `move` action. The only instances given are `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))` and `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`. This means the rovers are stuck in their initial configurations, with no ability to reach the required configurations defined as `#o3`, `#o0` or `#o5` for either the image capture, communication with the lander, or rock sampling. Moreover, only `drop_rock` instances are given. `send_image` and `send_analysis` are *not* provided.
           
           **The Inescapable Conclusion**
           
           Since I cannot move the rovers to the necessary configurations (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`) to satisfy the conditions for taking images and sampling rock (all of which are reliant on *not*-provided action instances), and I can't even send the required data, the `new-axiom@0()` goal is ultimately **unachievable**. The provided action instance list constraints and missing action instances, essentially render the problem unsolvable.
