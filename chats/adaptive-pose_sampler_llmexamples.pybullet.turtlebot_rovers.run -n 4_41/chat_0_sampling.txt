           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is essentially a large square room defined by bounding boxes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Box 5 is a long, thin obstacle in the middle of the room, running along the y-axis, creating two halves of the room. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the room, some of which are likely to cause occlusions or collisions.
           
           My strategy is to try to find positions around the target point at a reasonable distance. I will try to space them out to increase the chances of finding valid ones. I'll generally favor positions further away from the central divider (box 5) if the target is close to it. For this first request, I will try to get a good spread around the target point, keeping in mind the 2-unit distance constraint.

Model:     My previous attempts for the target point (0.7607786439564177, -0.6276239105417258) were not successful. The first one collided with obstacle 17 ((0.628506611615718, -1.656077254980504), (0.7540225279030198, -1.530561338693202)). This means I placed it too far south and into a small obstacle. The second position had no line of sight, likely due to a larger obstacle or the central divider. The third position collided with the central divider (box 5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))). This confirms my reasoning about the central divider being a major obstacle.
           
           The new target point is (0.5600294470787048, 2.090172529220581). This point is in the upper right quadrant of the map, and very close to the top edge and also somewhat close to the central divider (box 5). Given the previous failures, I will focus on staying away from known obstacles and specifically the central divider. I need to be careful with the smaller obstacles near the top, such as 9, 10, 19, 20, 21, and 22.
           
           I will try to place the robot to the right of the target point, and also slightly below it, to avoid the top wall and the central divider. I will also try a position further right, closer to the right wall, but still within range. A third position could be slightly to the left, but still clear of the central divider.

Model:     The previous requests were for two different target points. Let's re-evaluate.
           
           First target: (0.7607786439564177, -0.6276239105417258)
           - (0.7607786439564177, -1.6276239105417258) collided with box 17: ((0.628506611615718, -1.656077254980504), (0.7540225279030198, -1.530561338693202)). This means I need to be careful with the smaller obstacles, especially when moving perpendicular to the target.
           - (1.7607786439564177, -0.6276239105417258) had no line of sight. This could be due to several obstacles between the proposed position and the target point, or even the central divider if the target was on the other side.
           - (0.0, -0.6276239105417258) collided with box 5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)). This confirms that I should avoid positions with x values close to 0 when the target is on one side of the divider.
           
           Second target: (0.5600294470787048, 2.090172529220581)
           - (1.5600294470787048, 2.090172529220581) had no line of sight. This target is at y=2.09, which is very high. Several obstacles are in that region (9, 10, 19, 20, 21, 22), so moving straight to the right might have caused an occlusion. I previously suggested this position and it seems like it failed. The current feedback is for target point (-0.39802563190460205, 1.9509905576705933) and the *proposed position* from *that* request was (1.5600294470787048, 2.090172529220581). This is quite confusing as the proposed position belongs to the *previous* request for a *different* target. I will assume the *new* request is for (-0.39802563190460205, 1.9509905576705933) and the feedback about (1.5600294470787048, 2.090172529220581) is for this new target. This means that a position far to the right of the target will not work.
           
           The new target point is (-0.39802563190460205, 1.9509905576705933). This point is in the upper-left quadrant, near the top wall and also near the central divider (box 5). It is slightly to the *left* of the central divider.
           
           Given the failures, I will prioritize positions that are clearly to the left of the central divider and not too far to the right, to avoid occlusions. I will also try to keep a safe distance from the top wall and the small obstacles in that area (9, 10, 19, 20, 21, 22).
           
           Positions:
           (-0.39802563190460205 0.9509905576705933)
           (-1.398025631904602 1.9509905576705933)

Model:     This feedback is for the third target point (2.0918524265289307, 2.1556248664855957). It's in the top-right corner of the room. My previous suggestions for the target point (-0.39802563190460205, 1.9509905576705933) were:
           - (-0.39802563190460205, 0.9509905576705933) - no line of sight to target (2.0918524265289307, 2.1556248664855957)
           - (-1.398025631904602, 1.9509905576705933) - no line of sight to target (2.0918524265289307, 2.1556248664855957)
           - (-0.8, 1.5) - collided with box 13: ((-1.0077780726250216, 1.2333454844657379), (-0.8825443741980986, 1.3585791828926606)). This again highlights the need to be aware of the smaller, irregularly placed obstacles.
           
           It appears the evaluation system used the same proposed positions for a different target point. I need to be careful to propose positions relative to the *current* target point.
           
           The *current* target point is (2.0918524265289307, 2.1556248664855957). This point is in the top-right corner of the room, quite close to the walls and near obstacles 7, 14, and 20. The previous proposals for a target far to the left failed, which is expected since they were on the other side of the central divider.
           
           For this target, I should definitely stay on the right side of the central divider. I need to avoid box 20 ((2.0431365211981944, 2.1069089611548595), (2.140568331859667, 2.204340771816332)) as it's very close to the target, as well as boxes 7 ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) and 14 ((2.2176025983838357, 1.3587953922299663), (2.345863950535842, 1.4870567443819722)). I should also consider the main walls (1, 3).
           
           I will try positions further down from the target and slightly to the left or right to avoid the obstacles clustered near the top right.
