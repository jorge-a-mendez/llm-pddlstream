(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation Strategy**
           
           Okay, so the challenge is to place a square object (ID 4) with sides of approximately 0.08162 units, onto a square surface that spans from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  I need 50 stable placements, meaning the object's AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) needs to be *entirely* within the surface at all times.
           
           Since the object is square, its AABB remains square even when rotated. However, the size of this bounding box changes with rotation.  If the rotation angle (theta) is 0, pi/2, pi, or 3pi/2, the AABB size is the same as the object side. At other angles, the AABB is "inflated".  To calculate this "inflated" size, I use the formula `L_prime = L * (|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|)`, where `L` is the original side length (0.08162). This "inflated" size will be key to establishing if the placement is stable. The maximum size of this rotation is given by `L * sqrt(2) = 0.115426`.
           
           My strategy will involve generating a set of `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)` tuples. I'll stick with `surf_idx = 0` (the provided surface).  I'll vary `theta` to give the object different orientations and `x` and `y` to cover the surface.
           
           I'll calculate a "margin" value for my `x` and `y` range. The maximum allowed `x` and `y` values are dependent on the rotation of the object.  The margin calculation is `margin = 0.135 - L_prime / 2`. The maximum bounding box at 45 degrees needs more margin, and this is considered.
           
           I am choosing to generate the points this way:
           For `theta = 0`:  x_coords = [-0.09, -0.045, 0, 0.045, 0.09], y_coords = [-0.09, -0.045, 0, 0.045, 0.09]
           For `theta = pi/8`: x_coords = [-0.08, -0.04, 0, 0.04, 0.08], y_coords = [-0.08, -0.04, 0, 0.04, 0.08]
           
           This will gives me 25 points at each angle.  This results in exactly the required 50 placements in a diverse way on the surface.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object 5**
           
           Alright, let's break this down for object ID 5. We're placing this square on surface 0, and importantly, avoiding collision with the existing object 4, which is currently at `(-0.09, -0.09)` on the surface.
           
           First, I need to define the boundaries. The object 4 has dimensions of around 0.08162 x 0.08162, and its AABB is defined as [-0.13081, -0.04919] x [-0.13081, -0.04919]. The new object, 5, has sides of 0.09557.
           
           The surface 0 has the bounds [(-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)]. So, given that object 5 needs to fit inside the surface, it’s going to be key to define a margin. Considering that Object 5’s size depends on its rotation (theta), I have to find a strategy to select safe x and y locations for the center of the object 5.
           
           I'll try 2 distinct sets of placement:
           
           **Set 1: `theta=0` (no rotation)**
           To avoid collision with object 4, the placement needs to be at a location disjoint from object 4's area. With zero rotation, the max center coordinate is 0.087215. So,  I’m going to use a grid of points on the positive x and y quadrants starting at `x = 0.0` and `y = 0.0`, moving to `x = 0.08` and `y = 0.08`.
           
           **Set 2: `theta = pi/8` (approx. 22.5 degrees)**
           With a rotation of pi/8, the bounding box of object 5 is slightly larger (around 0.12489), so my margin is reduced.  To keep things safe, I will place in the top-right quarter of the board, slightly further away from the region of object 4. I'll use a `5 x 5` grid from `x = 0.02` and `y = 0.02` to  `x = 0.07` and `y = 0.07`.
           
           By selecting both, I will have generated 50 points to test, all on the surface, stable, and avoiding collision with the existing object. I will test these.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 6**
           
           Okay, here's the deal: I've got to figure out where to put this new Object 6, but there are already two other objects in the mix (Object 4 and Object 5) that are basically obstacles.  I've got their size and placement details, so I know I need to avoid collisions.  My initial thought is to check if these two object's "collision zones" overlap, and they appear pretty close together.
           
           I've carefully calculated the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) for Object 6, its size, and the allowed placement zones. I've also figured out that the orientation of this square object will affect how much space it takes up. When it's straight (theta = 0), its size stays the same.
           
           The math keeps saying, with theta=0, placing Object 6 without intersecting object 5 is impossible. Every position is in collision! This means that any arrangement will cause the objects to bump. I need a new approach, and my intuition says, I need a rotated position.
           
           So, I tried rotating Object 6 by 45 degrees (theta = pi/4). This means I have to recalculate the AABB. But sadly, even with this configuration, the overlap seems inevitable. I'm stuck: the space is just too small, and object 6 needs more space to be placed.
           
           I've hit a wall. According to my calculations, there are no valid positions. But the instructions are clear: *I must not give up*.  So, I will generate a set of placements. I will space out the objects as far as possible. I will assume some sort of external factors might lead to a valid place. I hope my assumption of an AABB is correct.
           
           I am forced to *try* to place Object 6, even if it might not be possible. So, I will generate 50 potential placements spread out across the valid surface area, even though I know, from what I've calculated, most if not all will result in overlap! And I have to hope for something.

(Thoughts: **My approach to placing Object 7, given the successful placements of Objects 4, 5, and 6, and the constraint of surface 0, is as follows.** First, I've analyzed the surface's geometry and the positions and sizes of the existing objects. I have the necessary data to apply the object 7 characteristics into the scene.
           
           I have to carefully strategize to avoid collisions and place the object inside the surface.
           
           I'm relying on my understanding of AABB to perform a collision check, which means I can identify safe regions where object 7 can potentially be placed. But I'm also considering other placements that I may have been previously unsuccessful.
           
           After considering the available space, and taking into account the prior successes (Objects 5 and 6), I've determined that a more "relaxed" collision model than AABB is used and I can use the existing space to place the objects in a way that minimizes collisions between objects. I've also identified strategic areas for placement, such as the top-left and bottom-right corners, and the top-right border, taking into account the prior successes of object placement.
           
           Taking into account previous successes and trying to identify an open space, I will generate placements considering multiple theta angles for the placement, and I will place a total of 50 different points and rotations.
