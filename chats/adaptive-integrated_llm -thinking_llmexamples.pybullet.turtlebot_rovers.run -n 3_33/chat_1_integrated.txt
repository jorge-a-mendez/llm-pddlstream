(Thoughts: **A Detailed Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to accomplish the goal `new-axiom@0()`, breaking down the requirements into actionable steps. My strategy involves utilizing the available rovers, their onboard camera, and communication capabilities.
           
           First, I need to ensure the core initial conditions are met: the rovers are at their starting configurations (`atconf`), and their stores are free (`free`). Since these are already true in the initial state, I can focus on acquiring the necessary image and analysis data.
           
           The key is to obtain images of objectives `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` and receive analyses for a stone and a soil sample. After reviewing the provided facts, I will focus on acquiring analysis data for a stone `v4` and soil sample `v8`.
           
           The strategy involves two rovers. Rover `v12` will handle the image capture and the stone sample analysis, while rover `v14` will acquire the soil sample analysis. To get the image data, I'll need to use these available actions: `take_image` and `send_image`. The precondition for the `take_image` is that the camera has been calibrated, and the `imagevisible` predicates are satisfied, the camera is operational, and the rover is at the appropriate configuration.
           
           **Rover v12 Plan:**
           
           1.  **Move to Image Config:** First, I'll move rover `v12` from its starting position (`v13`) to the image-taking configuration, `#o3`.
           2.  **Calibrate, Take Images, Repeat:** I'll `calibrate` the camera (`v10`) and take pictures of each objective (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`) from configuration `#o3`. However, the camera becomes "uncalibrated" after each image, so I must recalibrate between images. (I'd like a more efficient method if possible, but the problem's specifications force me to calibrate each time).
           3.  **Move to Comm Config:** Then, I'll move rover `v12` from the imaging configuration (`#o3`) to the communication configuration (`#o0`).
           4.  **Send Images:** From there, `send_image` to the lander (`v9`) for all the three pictures.
           5.  **Sample and Send Analysis (Stone):** Next, rover `v12` will move to the sample configuration (`#o5`) and sample the designated stone (`v4`). Subsequently, it moves back to the comm config `#o0` and `send_analysis`.
           6.  **Free the Store:** Finally, since `v12` has a full store after sampling, the store has to be free by dropping the rock.
           7.  **Return to start:** Rover v12 will return to initial position.
           
           **Rover v14 Plan:**
           
           1.  **Move to Sample (Soil):** Rover `v14` will move from its initial position (`v15`) to the sampling location (`#o5`).
           2.  **Sample (Soil):** Rover `v14` will then `sample_rock` the soil sample (`v8`).
           3.  **Move to Comm Config & Send Analysis:** Rover `v14` returns to the communication configuration (`#o0`), and then sends the soil analysis.
           4.  **Free the Store:** `drop_rock` on v14 to make the store free.
           5.  **Return to start:** Rover v14 will return to initial position.
           
           Regarding the continuous configuration locations, the specific problem statement instructs me to only provide values for configurations linked to `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicates, such as #o0 (used by both rovers) and #o3 (used only by v12).
           
           Here's my rationale for assigning specific coordinates to those configurations:
           
           *   **#o0**: This configuration is used for communication. Therefore, it has to be reachable by both rovers. Also, it needs to allow `comvisible` predicates to hold true, so it must be close enough to the lander (`v9`). My choice, `(-1.5, -2.0, 0.0)`, places this configuration near the target, accessible to both rovers.
           *   **#o3**: This configuration is needed for taking pictures of the three objectives, so I need to pick a spot from which the `imagevisible` predicates will be satisfied. Since the objectives are distributed, my initial attempts for this configuration were geometrically flawed, resulting in a series of contradictions. After evaluating, the coordinates `(0.0, 1.9, 0.0)` provide the right perspective for images.

           The key is to obtain images of objectives `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` and receive analyses for a stone and a soil sample. After reviewing the provided facts, I will focus on acquiring analysis data for a stone `v4` and soil sample `v8`.
           
           The strategy involves two rovers. Rover `v12` will handle the image capture and the stone sample analysis, while rover `v14` will acquire the soil sample analysis. To get the image data, I'll need to use these available actions: `take_image` and `send_image`. The precondition for the `take_image` is that the camera has been calibrated, and the `imagevisible` predicates are satisfied, the camera is operational, and the rover is at the appropriate configuration.
           
           **Rover v12 Plan:**
           
           1.  **Move to Image Config:** First, I'll move rover `v12` from its starting position (`v13`) to the image-taking configuration, `#o3`.
           2.  **Calibrate, Take Images, Repeat:** I'll `calibrate` the camera (`v10`) and take pictures of each objective (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`) from configuration `#o3`. However, the camera becomes "uncalibrated" after each image, so I must recalibrate between images. (I'd like a more efficient method if possible, but the problem's specifications force me to calibrate each time).
           3.  **Move to Comm Config:** Then, I'll move rover `v12` from the imaging configuration (`#o3`) to the communication configuration (`#o0`).
           4.  **Send Images:** From there, `send_image` to the lander (`v9`) for all the three pictures.
           5.  **Sample and Send Analysis (Stone):** Next, rover `v12` will move to the sample configuration (`#o5`) and sample the designated stone (`v4`). Subsequently, it moves back to the comm config `#o0` and `send_analysis`.
           6.  **Free the Store:** Finally, since `v12` has a full store after sampling, the store has to be free by dropping the rock.
           7.  **Return to start:** Rover v12 will return to initial position.
           
           **Rover v14 Plan:**
           
           1.  **Move to Sample (Soil):** Rover `v14` will move from its initial position (`v15`) to the sampling location (`#o5`).
           2.  **Sample (Soil):** Rover `v14` will then `sample_rock` the soil sample (`v8`).
           3.  **Move to Comm Config & Send Analysis:** Rover `v14` returns to the communication configuration (`#o0`), and then sends the soil analysis.
           4.  **Free the Store:** `drop_rock` on v14 to make the store free.
           5.  **Return to start:** Rover v14 will return to initial position.
           
           Regarding the continuous configuration locations, the specific problem statement instructs me to only provide values for configurations linked to `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicates, such as #o0 (used by both rovers) and #o3 (used only by v12).
           
           Here's my rationale for assigning specific coordinates to those configurations:
           
           *   **#o0**: This configuration is used for communication. Therefore, it has to be reachable by both rovers. Also, it needs to allow `comvisible` predicates to hold true, so it must be close enough to the lander (`v9`). My choice, `(-1.5, -2.0, 0.0)`, places this configuration near the target, accessible to both rovers.
           *   **#o3**: This configuration is needed for taking pictures of the three objectives, so I need to pick a spot from which the `imagevisible` predicates will be satisfied. Since the objectives are distributed, my initial attempts for this configuration were geometrically flawed, resulting in a series of contradictions. After evaluating, the coordinates `(0.0, 1.9, 0.0)` provide the right perspective for images.

(Thoughts: **Plan Refinement: Avoiding Collisions and Maintaining Mission Objectives**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The previous attempt failed because my chosen configurations for communication and imaging bumped into things. Not ideal. Specifically, the communication setup (#o0) was *inside* the lander, and the imaging setup (#o3) was right on top of this thin wall. That's a no-go.
           
           So, I need to find new spots for these functions. They still need to work, though, right? They need to be within reach of the rovers and have a clear line of sight to their targets.
           
           **Communication Configuration (#o0)**
           
           *   The lander's AABB is easy enough to spot. My old spot was *in* that AABB! No wonder it failed.
           *   I need to find a point *just outside* the lander, close enough for communication.  A quick distance check shows I can comfortably work at either (-1.0,-2.0) or (-2.8,-2.0), both of which are close to my rovers.
           *   The math checks out. (-1.0, -2.0) works, it's easily reachable, and it clears line of sight.
           
           **Imaging Configuration (#o3)**
           
           *   The tricky part: I need to get pictures of three objects, but avoid that darn wall at x=0.
           *   My old point was directly on the wall. D'oh!
           *   The targets are all roughly at y=1.9. So, let's try just moving off the wall slightly. I chose (0.1, 1.9, 0.0) as the x-coordinate shift, I think this will work.
           *   Distance checks show that (0.1, 1.9, 0.0) is within my imaging range, and it's outside the x-range of the wall. Nice! It's outside of the wall too.
           *   The new configuration at (0.1, 1.9) is a little farther away for rover travel, but the motion primitives are flexible so this seems like the best choice, given the constraint of the environment.
           
           **The Updated Plan Remains Robust**
           
           Now that I have these new collision-free configurations, the overall plan flow is solid. I can still:
           
           1.  Move Rover 1 to (0.1, 1.9, 0.0). Take the pictures, send them, move to (-1.0, -2.0, 0.0), send them, then sample then back to (-1.0, -2.0, 0.0) to send the sample analysis.
           2.  Move Rover 2 to -1.0, -2.0 and sample (v8), analyze and report.
           
           The fundamental structure of imaging, sending, sampling, and then reporting is good. All preconditions are met and this plan should work.

(Thoughts: **Refined Plan for Continuous Configurations**
           
           Based on the new set of errors provided, I’ve re-evaluated the configurations. The key goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, involving imaging, analysis of rocks, and delivery of those images/analyses.
           
           My initial approach of imaging from a single point for all targets proved impossible. The problem stated that multiple values for configuration objects are allowed, even if they are represented using the same object name. Based on this, I have updated the plan.
           
           - **Communication Configuration (`#o0`):** I’m now using the configuration `(-1.3, -2.0, 0.0)` for all communication steps. This is reachable by both rovers, and lies outside of the lander’s ( `v9` ) AABB.
           
           - **Imaging Configurations (`#o3`):** I've decided to use a separate imaging location for each rover, simplifying the plan:
               - **Rover `v12` will image `v17`**. The configuration, `#o3` for this rover will be `(1.0, 1.9, 0.0)`. This point is collision-free and, within range.
               - **Rover `v14` will image `v18` and `v19`**. The configuration, `#o3` for `v14` at `(-1.0, 1.9, 0.0)`.
           
           This approach ensures a collision-free and reachable plan, achieving the imaging objectives within the necessary range. 
           
           Here's a breakdown of the planned steps:
           1. `v12` moves to and images `v17`. After successful imaging, the images are sent and analyses.
           2. `v14` then moves to capture images of `v18` and `v19` and transmit them. 
           3. Both rovers then continue with their analysis and the dropping of the rocks.
