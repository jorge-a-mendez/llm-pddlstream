           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable Due to Action Restrictions**
           
           I'm facing a problem where I need to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which requires me to send images and analyses of stone and soil samples. However, the initial state only states what is true and does not contain any images or analyses. The key to solving this is to analyze the initial state and then to analyze which actions can be executed to achieve the goal.
           
           The key components of my goal are: capturing images related to specific objectives, analyzing samples of both stone and soil, and transmitting these results. This requires actions like `send_image` and `send_analysis`. To complete those actions, I need additional actions such as `take_image`, `calibrate`, and `sample_rock`.
           
           However, my permissible action set is restricted. I am limited to using `move` actions that only keep the rovers in their initial configurations, and `drop_rock`. Unfortunately, the available actions are not enough to complete the goal. Since I cannot execute actions such as `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock` or `send_analysis` the key goal will never be achievable. Based on the restriction of only the stated actions, the objective of gathering and transmitting data to complete the initial goal, can never be achieved, and the overall objective to send images and analyses of stone and soil samples, is impossible to meet within this specified set of actions. Therefore, this goal is *unreachable*.
