           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning for Achieving the Goal `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking, as an expert in my field. My ultimate goal is to figure out a plan to make `new-axiom@0()` happen. I'm breaking this down step by step.
           
           **Understanding the Goal:**
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` boils down to achieving several conditions simultaneously: getting images of some specific objectives, getting the analysis of rock samples, and ensuring that the rover is in the right location and that the store is freed after the samples are analyzed.
           
           **Initial Situation:**
           
           I've got the initial state conditions. Crucially, I know I've got two rovers, and a lander. Also, I see I already have some stuff in my "initial state." I have to use that information wisely. I can work with the rocks, images, and communications I already have in order to reach the goal.
           
           **The Main Tasks:**
           
           To meet the goal, I need to make some stuff happen:
           
           *   **Take images:** I need to receive images for several targets with a specific mode (v11).
           *   **Analyze samples:** I also need to receive the analyses for one rock of a certain type, and one of a different rock type.
           *   **Rover & Store Configuration**: I need to take into account the store and ensure it's free.
           
           **How to Achieve those Tasks:**
           
           To get those images and analyses, I'll need to figure out the right actions:
           
           *   **Receiving images (using the 'send_image' action):** I'll be using actions such as 'send\_image', 'take\_image', and 'calibrate'. All rovers have to do these things, in the correct order. I need to be in a position where I can see the target (communication-wise or image-wise) and the target. I need to get the "haveimage" condition for my target, I can do this by taking the image, and then sending it.
           
           *   **Receiving the analyses (using the 'send_analysis' action):** To receive analysis, I have to first ensure the rock is sampled and analyzed. I must know the locations of the rovers and the locations of the rocks. Then, I sample with 'sample\_rock'. Finally, I need to send the analyses using 'send_analysis'. Before I can do this, I have to ensure the rover is at the appropriate configuration. The store has to be free to get this to happen.
           
           **Selecting the Rover & Objects**:
           
           It looks like rover `v14` is a good choice for this task. It's close to where I need to start, and there are free and store variables available. I am using both `v1` and `v5` (different rock types) to analyze.
           
           I'm thinking about two configurations. First, there's a configuration where I can take images, and a configuration where I can communicate. I need to make sure the rover is at the *right* place to do those tasks.
           
           **Planning the Steps:**
           
           **1.  Initial Rover Position:** The rover, `v14`, starts at a specific configuration.
           
           **2.  Image Taking & Communication Plan:**
           
           *   I'll move the rover to a spot where I can take the pictures I need.
           *   Then I calibrate, take images of the targets.
           *   Then I move the rover again to where I can communicate with the lander.
           *   I'll send all those pictures.
           
           **3.  Rock Sampling Plan:**
           
           *   Next, I move `v14` to a sampling location near one of each rock type.
           *   I use the rock samples to get those two analyses that I need, one for rock `v1` and one for rock `v5`.
           *   I'll send the analysis to the lander to finish the plan.
           
           I have to carefully analyze each of the steps to fulfill all goals in the right order.
           
           **Key Considerations**:
           
           *   **Continuous Configuration Values:** I need to define the continuous (x, y) coordinates for the rover's position. I must make sure that it's collision-free and that the rover has a good line-of-sight to what it needs to image or communicate. The plan requires different, continuous values for image visible and communication. I provide coordinates.
           
           **Final Plan and Verification:**
           
           I have to verify that my plan completes each step, and that all initial conditions are in order, before finishing. The last step has to be a safe configuration for the rover.
           I'll also recheck those configurations that I used, and the values I picked.

Model:     **Summary of my Reasoning for Achieving the Goal `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking, as an expert in my field. My ultimate goal is to figure out a plan to make `new-axiom@0()` happen. I'm breaking this down step by step.
           
           **Understanding the Goal:**
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` boils down to achieving several conditions simultaneously: getting images of some specific objectives, getting the analysis of rock samples, and ensuring that the rover is in the right location and that the store is freed after the samples are analyzed.
           
           **Initial Situation:**
           
           I've got the initial state conditions. Crucially, I know I've got two rovers, and a lander. Also, I see I already have some stuff in my "initial state." I have to use that information wisely. I can work with the rocks, images, and communications I already have in order to reach the goal.
           
           **The Main Tasks:**
           
           To meet the goal, I need to make some stuff happen:
           
           *   **Take images:** I need to receive images for several targets with a specific mode (v11).
           *   **Analyze samples:** I also need to receive the analyses for one rock of a certain type, and one of a different rock type.
           *   **Rover & Store Configuration**: I need to take into account the store and ensure it's free.
           
           **How to Achieve those Tasks:**
           
           To get those images and analyses, I'll need to figure out the right actions:
           
           *   **Receiving images (using the 'send_image' action):** I'll be using actions such as 'send\_image', 'take\_image', and 'calibrate'. All rovers have to do these things, in the correct order. I need to be in a position where I can see the target (communication-wise or image-wise) and the target. I need to get the "haveimage" condition for my target, I can do this by taking the image, and then sending it.
           
           *   **Receiving the analyses (using the 'send_analysis' action):** To receive analysis, I have to first ensure the rock is sampled and analyzed. I must know the locations of the rovers and the locations of the rocks. Then, I sample with 'sample\_rock'. Finally, I need to send the analyses using 'send_analysis'. Before I can do this, I have to ensure the rover is at the appropriate configuration. The store has to be free to get this to happen.
           
           **Selecting the Rover & Objects**:
           
           It looks like rover `v14` is a good choice for this task. It's close to where I need to start, and there are free and store variables available. I am using both `v1` and `v5` (different rock types) to analyze.
           
           I'm thinking about two configurations. First, there's a configuration where I can take images, and a configuration where I can communicate. I need to make sure the rover is at the *right* place to do those tasks.
           
           **Planning the Steps:**
           
           **1.  Initial Rover Position:** The rover, `v14`, starts at a specific configuration.
           
           **2.  Image Taking & Communication Plan:**
           
           *   I'll move the rover to a spot where I can take the pictures I need.
           *   Then I calibrate, take images of the targets.
           *   Then I move the rover again to where I can communicate with the lander.
           *   I'll send all those pictures.
           
           **3.  Rock Sampling Plan:**
           
           *   Next, I move `v14` to a sampling location near one of each rock type.
           *   I use the rock samples to get those two analyses that I need, one for rock `v1` and one for rock `v5`.
           *   I'll send the analysis to the lander to finish the plan.
           
           I have to carefully analyze each of the steps to fulfill all goals in the right order.
           
           **Key Considerations**:
           
           *   **Continuous Configuration Values:** I need to define the continuous (x, y) coordinates for the rover's position. I must make sure that it's collision-free and that the rover has a good line-of-sight to what it needs to image or communicate. The plan requires different, continuous values for image visible and communication. I provide coordinates.
           
           **Final Plan and Verification:**
           
           I have to verify that my plan completes each step, and that all initial conditions are in order, before finishing. The last step has to be a safe configuration for the rover.
           I'll also recheck those configurations that I used, and the values I picked.
           
           The final PDDL plan will look like:
           
           1.  Move rover to

User:      Configuration #o3 = (1.0 1.5) for rover v14 at target v18 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (-0.4 0.5) for rover v14 at target v19 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (0.5 0.5) for rover v14 at target v20 is not valid because the target is not visible from the rover's camera due to occlusion.
           Configuration #o0 = (-1.5 -2.0) for rover v14 at target v9 is in collision with the following fixed obstacles:
           
           ```

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Revising Rover Configurations for Imaging and Communication**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback on the previous plan, and it's time to refine those continuous values, particularly for the imaging (#o3) and communication (#o0) configurations. The goal is to ensure reachability, collision-freeness, and that all the necessary objects are visible.
           
           First, let's address the imaging configurations for `v14`. I need to re-evaluate the proposed configurations to make sure the rover can actually reach them and that the targets are visible.
           
           *   **v17:** The initial suggestion of `(-1.0, 1.5)` is fine; it seems reachable, and the target is visible.
           *   **v18:** I need to find a new point since `(1.0, 1.5)` isn't reachable. I need to make sure I am close enough to ensure `imagevisible` constraint, so I am going to try `(1.5, 0.5)`
           *   **v19:** A new point to try is `(-0.5, 0.5)`. This puts the rover and v19 closer, so hopefully this will avoid occlusion.
           *   **v20:** Let's also find a new point to try, and let's go with `(0.0, 0.5)`. The previous feedback suggested that `(0.5, 0.5)` might have been blocked.
           
           It seems I *can* use multiple `#o3` instances for the imaging actions, so I will associate a distinct value for each target.
           
           Now, on to the communication configuration.
           
           *   For `v9` the previous plan was to use `(-1.5, -2.0)`, but this was inside the object. A new point should be selected, so it will be `(-0.5, -2.0)`, which looks reasonable.
           
           With that, I'll revise my plan, accounting for these configuration changes. I'll need to use distinct `#o3` configuration values per target to make things work. The plan steps are re-organized as follows:
           
           1.  Move to `#o3_v17`, take image.
           2.  Move to `#o3_v18`, take image.
           3.  Move to `#o3_v19`, take image.
           4.  Move to `#o3_v20`, take image.
           5.  Move to `#o0_v9`, send images.
           6.  Move to `#o5`, sample, drop `v1`, sample `v5`.
           7.  Move back to `#o0_v9`, send analysis and drop `v5`.
           8.  Move back to `v15`.
           
           The configurations are thus:
           
           *   `(#o3 v14 #o4 v17): (-1.0 1.5)`
           *   `(#o3 v14 #o4 v18): (1.5 0.5)`
           *   `(#o3 v14 #o4 v19): (-0.5 0.5)`
           *   `(#o3 v14 #o4 v20): (0.0 0.5)`
           *   `(#o0 v14 #o1 v9): (-0.5 -2.0)`
           *   `(#o5 v14 #o0 ?v1): (0.6, 0.3)`
           
           With this revised plan, I'm confident that the rover will successfully complete its mission, taking the necessary images, communicating, and sampling the rocks.

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my understanding of the best approach, given the constraints and feedback I've received. It's a bit complicated, but I've broken it down step by step.**
           
           The main issue is the `x=0` wall, which means I can't just pick convenient configurations without thinking. I need to get the images and send data to the Lander, and I can't be at a location that crashes into the wall while doing so. I have to be careful about not going through the barrier at `x=0` in my movements.
           
           Here's the plan I've come up with, and all the configurations:
           
           *   **Initial:** Rover starts at `v15` = (-1.0, -1.75).
           
           *   **Image Targets:** I need to image four objectives: `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`. Since the 'o3' parameter is shared between all of these for a set of `imagevisible` predicates, I have to assume a sequence of movements is needed to image all of these. I cannot use any of the old suggested values:
           
               *   `v17`:  needs a new '#o3' configuration; I chose  `#o3_v17`: `(-1.5, 0.5)`.
               *   `v18`: needs a new '#o3' configuration; I chose `#o3_v18`: `(1.5, 0.5)`.
               *   `v19`: needs a new '#o3' configuration; I chose `#o3_v19`: `(-0.5, 0.5)`.
               *   `v20`: needs a new '#o3' configuration; I chose `#o3_v20`: `(0.5, 0.5)`.
               These were selected because each new `#o3` configuration keeps the rover's location from colliding with `v21: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1))`. The proposed coordinates must also be within range of sight of their corresponding target.
           
           *   **Communicate:** Send images and other data to the lander `v9`. I also need a new '#o0' config that works for this. I've chosen `#o0_v9`: `(-1.0, -1.0)`.
           
           *   **Sampling:** Sample two rock locations, so I must locate new '#o5' configuration. The proposed coordinates are `#o5_sampling` `(0.6, 0.3)`.
           
           *   **Movements and Path Planning**: Now the movements need to happen. This means I will be "moving to" and then "from" each set of proposed coordinates, and the path planner can fill in the appropriate action. Here's what I want to happen:
           
               1.  Move the rover from `v15 (-1.0, -1.75)` to `#o3_v17 (-1.5, 0.5)`. Image `v17`.
               2.  Move the rover from `#o3_v17 (-1.5, 0.5)` to `#o3_v19 (-0.5, 0.5)`. Image `v19`.
               3.  Move the rover from `#o3_v19 (-0.5, 0.5)` to `#o0_v9 (-1.0, -1.0)`. Send the images for `v17` and `v19`.
               4.  Move the rover from `#o0_v9 (-1.0, -1.0)` to `#o3_v20 (0.5, 0.5)`. Image `v20`.
               5.  Move the rover from `#o3_v20 (0.5, 0.5)` to `#o3_v18 (1.5, 0.5)`. Image `v18`.
               6.  Move the rover from `#o3_v18 (1.5, 0.5)` to `#o5_sampling (0.6, 0.3)`. Pick up and drop rocks.
               7.  Move the rover from `#o5_sampling (0.6, 0.3)` to `#o0_v9 (-1.0, -1.0)`. Send rock analysis information.
               8.  Move the rover from `#o0_v9 (-1.0,

User:      Configuration #o3 = (-1.5 0.5) for rover v14 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (-0.5 0.5) for rover v14 at target v19 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-1.0 -1.0) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (0.5 0.5) for rover v14 at target v20 is not valid because the target is not visible from the rover's camera due to occlusion.
           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **My Thinking on Automating Rover Operations**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan: I'm tasked with devising a sequence of actions for a rover, named 'v14', to achieve the `Atom new-axiom@0()` goal in the `rovers` domain. The primary challenge is ensuring the rover's movements are reachable (within its capabilities), collision-free (avoiding obstacles), and provide a clear line of sight for imaging and communication. I've been wrestling with this because I've encountered failures, so I need to be extra meticulous.
           
           First, I need to get a handle on the key requirements. 'v14' starts at its start configuration, which I'll denote as `v15`. My goal involves taking and sending images of specific objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`) and sampling and analyzing rocks (`v1` and `v5`). The core tasks involve using the rover, and all actions hinge on clear visibility and reachability constraints. The domain includes a wall at x=0, which poses the greatest challenge for movement and visibility, which is designated as `v21`.
           
           I've laid out the plan in the following structure to meet the requirements of my domain:
           1.  **Objective Evaluation**: I need to get photos of the relevant obstacles and send them back to the lander, designated as `v9` with the configurations already set. The domain is also set to analyze the relevant types of rock.
           2.  **Navigation and Obstacles**: I have to navigate around the wall `v21` that extends vertically at x=0. The rover must have a clear line of sight, denoted `imagevisible` and `comvisible`. Obstacle and objective locations will be key for planning.
           3.  **Pathing and Imaging**: I need to arrange the rover's movements to be efficient. The rover will move to take the images from the locations of the objectives. The image locations will be carefully selected with reachability and visibility in mind.
           4.  **Sampling**: `v1` will sample `v1` at configuration `v16` and sample `v5` to complete the sampling requirements.
           5.  **Sending Analysis**: I have to return to send the analysis. This takes place after sampling is complete and the rover has returned.
           
           My strategy involves a series of moves to get all the data and analyses back to base. Here is a more simplified breakdown:
           
           1.  **Imaging the Left Side**: I'll move the rover to positions to capture images of objectives `v17` and `v19` on the left side of the wall.
           2.  **Move to Comms (Left)**: Moving the rover to communications at lander `v9`.
           3.  **Cross to the Right Side**: I need to move from the left side to the right to acquire data.
           4.  **Image the Right Side**: Capture images of objectives `v20` and `v18`.
           5.  **Sampling on the Right Side**: I'll move to sample the rocks `v1` and `v5`.
           6.  **Return to the Left Side**: Moving back to `v9` so the analyses can be transmitted.
           7.  **Final Return**: Finally, the rover returns to the start configuration, `v15`.
           
           **Addressing the Previous Issues**: I'll be really careful in selecting configurations. Previous issues resulted from the configuration's lack of reachability. To ensure reachability, I'll put my chosen configurations far enough from `v21` to make the path findable, with all those factors in mind.
           
           To achieve this plan, I'll need to use these actions:
           
           ```
           (move v14 v15 #o2 #o3) ; move to #o3 for v17
           (calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)
           (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)
           
           (move v14 #o3 #o2 #o3) ; move to #o3 for v19
           (calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v19 v10)
           (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v19 v10 v11)
           
           (move v14 #o3 #o2 #o0) ; move to #o0 for v9
           (send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11)
           (send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v19 v11)
           
           (move v14 #o0 #o2 #o3) ;
)
