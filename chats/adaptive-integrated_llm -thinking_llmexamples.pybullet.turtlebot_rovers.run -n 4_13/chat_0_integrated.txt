(Thoughts: **A Plan to Satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` Goal**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of how I'm going to achieve this `new-axiom@0()` goal, thinking through it step-by-step:
           
           First, let's decipher the goal itself. It's an `Axiom` composed of several `Atoms`, basically conditions that all need to be true.  I see that there's a conjunction, meaning *all* the atoms must be true to satisfy the goal. I've broken down all the conditions in the goal:
           
           *   **Initial Conditions (Already True):**
               *   `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover `v12` is at its base configuration `v13`.
               *   `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover `v14` is at its base configuration `v15`.
               *   `free(v12, v16)`: Rover `v12` has a free store `v16`.
               *   `free(v14, v16)`: Rover `v14` has a free store `v16`.
           *   **Conditions to Achieve (Currently False):**
               *   `receivedimage(v17, v11)`:  An image of objective `v17` is received in mode `v11`.  Same for `v18, v19, v20`.
               *   `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: At least one "stone" has had its analysis received.
               *   `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: At least one "soil" has had its analysis received.
           
           Given this, it's clear I need to receive images from all objectives and analyze both soil and stone samples.
           
           **The Strategy: Imaging and Analysis**
           
           To solve this, I will break the plan into two main parts:
           
           **Part A: Image Acquisition and Transmission**
           
           1.  **Imaging:** I'll leverage the camera (`v10`) on either rover (`v12` or `v14`). The actions needed include `take_image` (to capture the image, which requires being `imagevisible` to the objective, and being in a calibrated state of the camera). This requires the `calibrate` action. Then, I need to make the images available via the `send_image` action (with the `comvisible` precondition to the lander), using the specified mode (`v11`).
           2.  **Obstacles:** This is where things become tricky. I am *required* to make use of continuous configurations (using `#` to define each config), and, based on the problem statement, I *must* set these based on a few rules:
           
               1.  I have to ensure `imagevisible` and `comvisible` constraints are satisfied.
               2.  For any action using these '#' configurations, the configuration must be collision-free and, for `imagevisible`, have an occlusion-free line-of-sight with its targets. Also, the configuration must be *reachable* from the base config.
           
               So, I will have to define several 'configs':
               `#o0` (v12, v14): used to satisfy `comvisible` to `v9`
               `#o3` (v12, v14): used to satisfy `imagevisible` to `v17, v18, v19, v20`
               `#o5` (v12, v14): used to sample various soils
           
           **Part B: Soil and Stone Analysis**
           
           1.  **Sampling:** Both rovers `v12` and `v14` have `above` relationships with various objects. For the goal, I need to analyze a stone and a soil.
           2.  **Analysis:** The `sample_rock` action is required.  For any rock I choose, this action will require the `above` precondition with the associated rover, object, and configuration. The store for each rover (v16) needs to be `free`. To transmit this for analysis, I'll need `send_analysis` that requires `analyzed` samples and the necessary `comvisible` constraints. The initial goal states `free`, so the samples cannot persist in their stores. We'll use the `drop_rock` action at the end to satisfy.
           
           **The Plan**
           
           Here's the detailed plan I've constructed, leveraging what I know to satisfy the rules, including explicit coordinates (coordinates below are for reference; these would be passed to a motion planner to confirm those locations are viable).
           All coordinates will be listed in each action's pre-condition.

               *   `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover `v14` is at its base configuration `v15`.
               *   `free(v12, v16)`: Rover `v12` has a free store `v16`.
               *   `free(v14, v16)`: Rover `v14` has a free store `v16`.
           *   **Conditions to Achieve (Currently False):**
               *   `receivedimage(v17, v11)`:  An image of objective `v17` is received in mode `v11`.  Same for `v18, v19, v20`.
               *   `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: At least one "stone" has had its analysis received.
               *   `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: At least one "soil" has had its analysis received.
           
           Given this, it's clear I need to receive images from all objectives and analyze both soil and stone samples.

               So, I will have to define several 'configs':
               `#o0` (v12, v14): used to satisfy `comvisible` to `v9`
               `#o3` (v12, v14): used to satisfy `imagevisible` to `v17, v18, v19, v20`
               `#o5` (v12, v14): used to sample various soils
           
           **Part B: Soil and Stone Analysis**
           
           1.  **Sampling:** Both rovers `v12` and `v14` have `above` relationships with various objects. For the goal, I need to analyze a stone and a soil.
           2.  **Analysis:** The `sample_rock` action is required.  For any rock I choose, this action will require the `above` precondition with the associated rover, object, and configuration. The store for each rover (v16) needs to be `free`. To transmit this for analysis, I'll need `send_analysis` that requires `analyzed` samples and the necessary `comvisible` constraints. The initial goal states `free`, so the samples cannot persist in their stores. We'll use the `drop_rock` action at the end to satisfy.
           
           **The Plan**
           
           Here's the detailed plan I've constructed, leveraging what I know to satisfy the rules, including explicit coordinates (coordinates below are for reference; these would be passed to a motion planner to confirm those locations are viable).
           All coordinates will be listed in each action's pre-condition.

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of Achieving the Goal**
           
           I've been given a crucial constraint: my plan must be built solely from a very restrictive set of actions. The user pointed out the prior plan contained invalid actions, so I need to re-evaluate. I'm limited to `move` and `drop_rock`. This forces a fundamental re-think of how to achieve the given goal, `new-axiom@0()`.
           
           Analyzing the goal, it demands achieving `receivedimage` predicates for four instances, as well as `receivedanalysis` predicates for both a stone and soil. These are crucial elements. The initial state, as provided, satisfies some simpler requirements, but utterly lacks the necessary `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` facts.
           
           Scrutinizing the permissible actions, I find they are woefully inadequate. The `move` actions are essentially no-ops; they shift a rover to the *same* configuration. The `drop_rock` actions, while theoretically capable of altering `free` predicates, are, in actuality, inapplicable initially because the `full` preconditions are unmet. Even if applicable, they *only* adjust the `free` state, which is already true. They provide zero progress towards the crucial `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` goals.
           
           The explicit statement that any unstated fact is false seals the deal.  The initial state *does not* include the required `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` facts. Furthermore, the provided actions have absolutely *no* capacity to generate these facts. They cannot produce the image and analysis data needed to fulfill the goal.
           
           Therefore, given the restrictive action set, `new-axiom@0()` is *unachievable*.  I cannot devise a valid plan because I lack the necessary operators to generate the required goal states.  My only recourse is to explain this inherent limitation. I cannot progress any further with this restricted task.

The initial state, as provided, satisfies some simpler requirements, but utterly lacks the necessary `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` facts.
           
           Scrutinizing the permissible actions, I find they are woefully inadequate. The `move` actions are essentially no-ops; they shift a rover to the *same* configuration. The `drop_rock` actions, while theoretically capable of altering `free` predicates, are, in actuality, inapplicable initially because the `full` preconditions are unmet. Even if applicable, they *only* adjust the `free` state, which is already true. They provide zero progress towards the crucial `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` goals.
           
           The explicit statement that any unstated fact is false seals the deal.  The initial state *does not* include the required `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` facts. Furthermore, the provided actions have absolutely *no* capacity to generate these facts. They cannot produce the image and analysis data needed to fulfill the goal.
           
           Therefore, given the restrictive action set, `new-axiom@0()` is *unachievable*.  I cannot devise a valid plan because I lack the necessary operators to generate the required goal states.  My only recourse is to explain this inherent limitation. I cannot progress any further with this restricted task.
