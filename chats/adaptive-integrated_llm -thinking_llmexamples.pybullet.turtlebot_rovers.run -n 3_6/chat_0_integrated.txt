           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Assessment: Unreachability of Goal new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, let's break this down systematically. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. Examining the axiom, it boils down to several key facts needing to be true: acquiring images of objects (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`) with mode `v11` and getting analyses of rocks of types `v2` and `v6`.
           
           Initially, two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, are at configurations `v13` and `v15` respectively. They both have a camera (`v10`) supporting mode `v11` and an empty store (`v16`). The plan hinges on these rovers performing several actions: calibrating the camera, capturing and sending images, taking rock samples, and transmitting the analysis.
           
           To capture images (`receivedimage`), the rovers need to be at configurations where the objects are visible (`imagevisible`) and where they can communicate (`comvisible`). This is where the challenge arises.  The initial state defines `imagevisible` and `comvisible` using *different* configurations (#o0 and #o3) than their starting locations. This necessitates the use of the `move` action.
           
           However, the provided `move` action instances are suspicious. They essentially move the rover *to itself*, meaning the `atconf` predicate remains unchanged.  For instance, `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)` moves `v14` *from* `v15` *to* `v15`. Since we are forced to stick to these, there is *no way* for the rovers to move to configurations `#o0` or `#o3`.
           
           The initial state uses `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` for the configurations. These are *possible* configurations because they are used in predicates like `imagevisible` and `comvisible`. Because of the way the question is worded, it means that even if a *possible* state is not true initially, it is always false. The action specifications demand that the `atconf` predicate must equal the configuration for some continuous value when image, communication, or rock actions are performed. There are *no other* `move` actions, the existing action instances can not change `atconf` in any meaningful way.
           
           Without the ability to move rovers to these key configurations (#o0, #o3, #o5), the necessary preconditions for actions like `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` remain unmet.
           
           Since the rovers cannot reach the configurations required for imaging and analysis, the subgoals are unreachable. Therefore, `new-axiom@0()` can not be achieved given the restricted `move` actions. The goal is unachievable given these constraints.
