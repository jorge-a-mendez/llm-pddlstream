           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal: Achieve new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The task is to satisfy a specific axiom, `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to: "Get images of three objects (v17, v18, v19), and get analyses of a stone and soil." I'm seeing the initial state has the first four conditions of the axiom already satisfied. That means I need to focus on getting those images and analyses.
           
           I can achieve this with a carefully orchestrated series of actions. The plan is straightforward: use rover `v14`. I see that `atconf(v14, v15)` so I'll be starting from there.
           
           **Image Acquisition:**
           
           1.  **Move Rover:** First, I'll maneuver rover `v14` from its current location `v15` to a more strategic point, labeled as `#o3`. This will allow me to take images. It seems that this location, `#o3`,  is ideal for the images of the three targets, based on pre-defined facts (`imagevisible`). It's a bit of a gamble, because I don't know the exact coordinates yet. I'll need to define it later.
           2.  **Image, Image, Image:** Then, I'll use the camera (`v10`) on the rover to take an image of each of the three objects, labeled as `v17, v18, and v19`, using the `take_image` action with `calibrated` as prerequisite. `take_image` negates `calibrated(c, v)`, so I'll need to recalibrate, which I'll handle.
           3.  **Communication Configuration:** Afterwards, the rover will need to move to  `#o0` to upload the images.
           4.  **Upload Images:** Finally, I'll use `send_image` to send the three images. I have to make sure `v9` is configured for communication.
           
           **Sampling and Analysis:**
           
           Now for getting analyses of those rock and soil samples. I need to sample, and send the results:
           
           1.  **Move to Sample:** I'll move the rover from `#o0` to `#o5` which puts it `above` the rocks, for rock sampling.
           2.  **Analysis:** I'll then sample the stone (`v1`) and soil (`v5`) with `sample_rock`.
           3.  **Drop to get FREE:** I'm going to drop a sample, since the sample containers are one-use. This sample, `v16`, gets the `free(v14,v16)` which will be important.
           4.  **Upload Analyses:** Finally, I'll send the analyses to  `#o0`, with the lander `v9`.
           
           To satisfy the goals, rover needs to return to its original position at  `v15`.
           
           **The Continuous Values:**
           
           Now, to make this work, I'll need to define the continuous values for the configurations. These coordinates are required for locations or targets.
           The format provided gives me locations to specify for rover with locations used by communications and imaging and the rock for sampling.
           
           My plan has three critical configurations:
           
           *   **#o0: Comms:** Rover `v14` needs to be near the lander (`v9`) for image and analysis uploads. I'll set `#o0` to `(-1.5, -1.9)`.
           *   **#o3: Imaging:** `#o3` is the ideal position for the rover `v14` to see all three image targets (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`). Though there seems a possible slight issue here based on some distance calculations, PDDL relies on facts given as true in the initial state so I have to assume its fine. I'll need a position close to `y=2` on y-axis, but not so distant. So, I'll set `#o3` to `(0.0, 1.0)`.
           *   **#o5: Sampling:** `#o5` is the configuration where the rover is 'above' the rocks to sample them. This requires rover close by, but not in contact. I pick the rock centroids and make `#o5` to be `(0.26, -0.965)`.
           
           **Final Plan:**
           
           1.  `move(v14, v15, #o2, #o3)`
           2.  `calibrate(v14, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)`
           3.  `take_image(v14, #
)

           I can achieve this with a carefully orchestrated series of actions. The plan is straightforward: use rover `v14`. I see that `atconf(v14, v15)` so I'll be starting from there.
           
           **Image Acquisition:**
           
           1.  **Move Rover:** First, I'll maneuver rover `v14` from its current location `v15` to a more strategic point, labeled as `#o3`. This will allow me to take images. It seems that this location, `#o3`,  is ideal for the images of the three targets, based on pre-defined facts (`imagevisible`). It's a bit of a gamble, because I don't know the exact coordinates yet. I'll need to define it later.
           2.  **Image, Image, Image:** Then, I'll use the camera (`v10`) on the rover to take an image of each of the three objects, labeled as `v17, v18, and v19`, using the `take_image` action with `calibrated` as prerequisite. `take_image` negates `calibrated(c, v)`, so I'll need to recalibrate, which I'll handle.
           3.  **Communication Configuration:** Afterwards, the rover will need to move to  `#o0` to upload the images.
           4.  **Upload Images:** Finally, I'll use `send_image` to send the three images. I have to make sure `v9` is configured for communication.
           
           **Sampling and Analysis:**
           
           Now for getting analyses of those rock and soil samples. I need to sample, and send the results:
           
           1.  **Move to Sample:** I'll move the rover from `#o0` to `#o5` which puts it `above` the rocks, for rock sampling.
           2.  **Analysis:** I'll then sample the stone (`v1`) and soil (`v5`) with `sample_rock`.
           3.  **Drop to get FREE:** I'm going to drop a sample, since the sample containers are one-use. This sample, `v16`, gets the `free(v14,v16)` which will be important.
           4.  **Upload Analyses:** Finally, I'll send the analyses to  `#o0`, with the lander `v9`.
           
           To satisfy the goals, rover needs to return to its original position at  `v15`.
           
           **The Continuous Values:**
           
           Now, to make this work, I'll need to define the continuous values for the configurations. These coordinates are required for locations or targets.
           The format provided gives me locations to specify for rover with locations used by communications and imaging and the rock for sampling.
           
           My plan has three critical configurations:
           
           *   **#o0: Comms:** Rover `v14` needs to be near the lander (`v9`) for image and analysis uploads. I'll set `#o0` to `(-1.5, -1.9)`.
           *   **#o3: Imaging:** `#o3` is the ideal position for the rover `v14` to see all three image targets (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`). Though there seems a possible slight issue here based on some distance calculations, PDDL relies on facts given as true in the initial state so I have to assume its fine. I'll need a position close to `y=2` on y-axis, but not so distant. So, I'll set `#o3` to `(0.0, 1.0)`.
           *   **#o5: Sampling:** `#o5` is the configuration where the rover is 'above' the rocks to sample them. This requires rover close by, but not in contact. I pick the rock centroids and make `#o5` to be `(0.26, -0.965)`.
           
           **Final Plan:**
           
           1.  `move(v14, v15, #o2, #o3)`
           2.  `calibrate(v14, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)`
           3.  `take_image(v14, #

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **My Re-Evaluation of the Rover's Configurations**
           
           The original plan had some collision issues with the `#o0` and `#o3` configurations, and I need to resolve them while ensuring I still meet the *comvisible* and *imagevisible* predicates.
           
           **1. `#o0` (Communication):** The initial plan had this point colliding with the lander. The idea is to find a configuration that provides line-of-sight communication with the lander *without* collision. I started by looking at the lander's position and bounding box, noting the previous configuration was *inside* the lander's box. The lander is roughly at `(-1.9, -2.0)`. I chose `(-0.9, -1.8)` for `#o0`, because it provides both a clear view and lies on a path that does not collide. The distance to the lander's centroid is around 1.02 units, well within the 4-unit communication range. Plus, the provided `motion` predicates in the initial state make this transition possible.
           
           **2. `#o3` (Imaging):**  This configuration was colliding with a wall. My goal here is to establish the position of the rover so that it has line of sight to all three imaging targets: `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`. I noticed they were spread across the x-axis, with a wall (`v20`) at x=0. The previous plan position was on the wall. To achieve all the `imagevisible` predicates, I had to ensure the rover can view the imaging targets while not colliding with the wall.  I moved `#o3` to `(0.1, 1.0)`, which is close enough to be in range of the sensors, but clearly *not* inside the wall, so the collision is gone.
           
           **3. `#o5` (Above Rocks):** The original point was a centroid. My goal is to position the rover above the rocks for analysis.  Since the initial state predicates *`above`* are given using the `"#o5"` configuration, the plan requires using this point. Based on the position of the rocks, I stuck with the previous central position `(0.26, -0.965)`. It's reachable and the plan doesn't mention any obstacles.
           
           I've re-evaluated all required configurations and adjusted the coordinates. The motion predicates in the initial state support these movements. All requirements should be satisfied. I believe the updated plan is now collision-free and still valid.

(Thoughts: **Refining Configuration Strategies Based on Feedback and Constraints**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback that my initial choices for continuous configurations aren't quite cutting it. I need to revisit my approach, paying close attention to both reachability and collision avoidance. The challenge here is to find a set of values that satisfy the problem's constraints while navigating the specific geometry of this environment. Let's dig in.
           
           For communication, the goal is to establish contact between rover *v14* and lander *v9*.  My initial point, `(-0.9, -1.8)`, was deemed unreachable.  Considering the rover's starting position at `(-1.0, -1.75)` and the lander's general location (around `(-1.9, -2.0)`), I need something within the rover's `motion` capabilities, while also avoiding collisions and staying within the comms range. I now believe, considering both reachability and obstacle avoidance, that a move to `(-1.1, -1.4)` will ensure both.
           
           For the imaging task, my initial configuration `(0.1, 1.0)` was colliding with a wall. Now I need to see objectives at several points in the map while also avoiding an obstacle at `x=0`. To ensure both is possible I will choose `(0.25, 1.0)`.
           
           Finally, for the crucial `above` condition, I had previously tried `(0.26, -0.965)`, but it was flagged as unreachable.  The `above` requirement for two rocks, `v1` and `v5`, located at different parts of the scene, poses a unique challenge. Since the initial state already implies that such a configuration *is* achievable, I need to try a new point. Taking advantage of the fact that a straight line from rover initial location could make `above` condition harder to maintain, while respecting obstacle avoidance rules. Therefore, I will try a position very close to `v1`'s center: `(-0.3, -1.9)`.
           
           With these adjustments, I'm confident that these coordinates will allow me to navigate this mission's constraints. I have ensured these points are collision-free and, importantly, reachable from the rover's initial position and other reachable waypoints.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Rover Configuration and Task Planning**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with devising a plan for a rover, specifically `v14`, to achieve the `new-axiom@0()` goal in the `rovers` domain. The task breaks down into multiple objectives, centered around image acquisition and analysis: `atconf`, `free`, `receivedimage`, and `receivedanalysis`.  My primary focus is on `v14` as the workhorse of this mission.
           
           Initially, `v14` is located at `(-1.0, -1.75)`, denoted as `v15`, and is equipped with a store (`v16`) that starts free. The challenge lies in determining collision-free, reachable, and occlusion-free configurations for `v14`. This involves navigating around obstacles, particularly a lander (`v9`) with an AABB `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`, and a wall (`v20`) with an AABB `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`, which I must use my knowledge of.
           
           My goal is to carefully evaluate each required configuration, paying close attention to reachability and collision avoidance. The available "motion" predicates are generic trajectories.  The problem revolves around the configurations:
              - `#o0`: Communication with the lander.
              - `#o3`: Imaging of objectives `v17, v18, v19`.
              - `#o5`: Sampling rocks (`v1` and `v5`).
           
           My initial coordinates were met with reachability issues, suggesting a pathing conflict. This prompted a complete re-evaluation with different values:
           
           1.  **Communication Configuration (`#o0`):** I settled on `(-1.1, -1.5)`. This should be reachable from my starting point `v15`  `(-1.0, -1.75)`, it's within communication range of the lander (`v9`), and it is also collision-free. I am very confident with this solution.
           
           2.  **Imaging Configuration (`#o3`):** This is the tricky one. The goal is to obtain images of `v17` `(0.51, 2.05)`, `v18` `(-0.68, 2.14)`, and `v19` `(1.82, 2.15)`.  Collision with the wall at x=0 must be avoided. My reasoning lead me to try and then reconsider the coordinate for `(0.5, 1.0)`.
           
           *   Collision Check: AABB `((0.317, 0.821), (0.683, 1.179))`, Collision-free
           *   Reachability from `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)`: `sqrt(9.8125) ~ 3.13`. This could be problematic and is the most contentious part of this problem.
           
           I finally settle on `#o3` = `(0.5, 1.0)`, because of the `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o3)` initial predicate given in the problem statement.
           
           3.  **Sampling Configuration (`#o5`):** My target is the stone at `(-0.337, -2.0)`, designated as `v1`, and soil at `(0.854, 0.075)`, designated as `v5`. `(-0.4, -1.8)` looks like a suitable point for sampling because this is:
               - Close to v1
               - Within the `above` predicate, but the reachability is unclear.
           
           If no constraints exists, I believe the plan should work.
           
           My plan has the following steps:
           1. `v14` will move to `#o3 (imaging config)`, calibrates, and then takes images.
           2. `v14` will move to `#o0` (comms config), where it will send the images.
           3. `v14` will move to `#o5` (sampling config), it samples.
           4. `v14` will send analysis.
