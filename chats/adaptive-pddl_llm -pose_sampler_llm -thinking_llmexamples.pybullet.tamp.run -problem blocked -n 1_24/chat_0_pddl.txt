           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, I've got the task: find 50 stable placements for a 0.07 x 0.07 object (ID 5) on surface 0, defined by the coordinates ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  Since this is a square-ish object, and I'm looking for a quick solution, I'll stick to a theta of 0 degrees; rotation isn't going to significantly change its AABB.  I'm dealing with the first request for this object, so I don't have any prior collisions to worry about.  My goal is to place the object's AABB fully within the surface's AABB.
           
           First, I define the valid area for placement. I calculated the half-extents of the object (hx = hy = 0.035) and then determined the valid X and Y ranges for the object's center: 4.235 <= x <= 4.765 and -0.565 <= y <= -0.035. This gives me a rectangular area of 0.53 x 0.53. I'll make sure each placement is within these bounds.
           
           To ensure sufficient diversity, I'll generate a grid of placements.  I figured an 8x7 grid (56 points) would provide a good spread while exceeding the 50 placements needed. The spacing should be reasonably uniform to avoid excessive clustering.
           
           I'll calculate `dx` and `dy` based on the grid dimensions. `dx` is approximately 0.0757 and `dy` is approximately 0.0883, giving us 7 steps in the x direction and 6 steps in the y direction.
           
           Now, I'll iterate through the grid: `surf_idx = 0`, `theta = 0` for all placements. Then, I calculate X and Y coordinates with my dx and dy spacing, going up to 8x7 to get 56 placements. After the coordinates are calculated, I'll grab the first 50 results. I'll make sure to round the coordinates to 10 decimal places. That should give me the 50 stable placements I need!
