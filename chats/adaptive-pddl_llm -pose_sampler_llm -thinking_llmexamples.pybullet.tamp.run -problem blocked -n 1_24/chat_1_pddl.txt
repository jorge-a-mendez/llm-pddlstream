           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning for Reaching the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with the goal of `new-axiom@0()`, which I've determined means getting a green object *on* something. I see that there are two objects in the initial state that could be green, `v8` and `v12`. To get an object *on* something, I need the `on` predicate to be true, which is defined by `supported` and `atpose`.
           
           I start by looking at `v8` and the poses it can be at. I notice that `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is true. This means, if I can get `v8` to be `atpose(#o2)`, it will be on `v18`. Similarly for `v12`. I decide to focus on `v8`.
           
           The plan is simple: to make `on(v8, v18)` true, I'll need to use `pick` and `place` actions to move `v8` from its current pose (`v9`) to `#o2`. To use these actions, I need to check their preconditions.
           
           Here's where it gets complicated. The `kin` predicates, which dictate how the robot's arm works, all involve the base configuration `#o3`. The `pick` and `place` actions both require `atbconf(?q)` where `?q` is the base configuration. My initial state says I'm at `atbconf(v3)`. The provided `move_base` action is a no-op, meaning it doesn't change my base configuration.
           
           My primary focus shifts to this. The provided action has strange conflicting effects - claiming the initial state and negated initial state will be true together, so is likely invalid. I'm faced with this situation: to pick and place I *need* base configuration `#o3` (according to the kin predicates), but I'm currently at base configuration `v3`, and there's no way to reach `#o3`. All arm actions seem to require `#o3`.
           
           I conclude that, *with the given actions*, the goal is unreachable. The only actions that can change object poses are `pick` and `place`, and their preconditions are impossible to satisfy. I can't achieve the final goal.
