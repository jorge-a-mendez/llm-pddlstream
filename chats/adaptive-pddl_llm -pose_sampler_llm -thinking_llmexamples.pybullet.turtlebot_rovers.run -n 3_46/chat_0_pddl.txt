           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning for New Axiom**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've broken down the goal `new-axiom@0()` into manageable chunks. The key here is to get three images, analyze a rock and a soil sample, and then communicate the results. The initial state gives me everything I need except those specific analysis results and images.
           
           First, I'm going to leverage rover `v12` because it's at `v13` (where I assume the action prerequisites such as `atconf(v12, #o0)`, `atconf(v12, #o3)` and `atconf(v12, #o5)` are true). I'll take a series of pictures of targets `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` using camera `v10` and mode `v11`. Because the camera needs recalibration after each image, I'll `calibrate` before each `take_image` action. Then, I'll send each image to the lander using the `send_image` action. This will satisfy the `receivedimage` predicates.
           
           Next, I need to get the `receivedanalysis` predicates. I'll use rover `v12` to sample a rock `v1` (of type `v2`, which is what I want) and a soil sample `v5` (of type `v6`, my other target). I'll use `sample_rock` action for this. I can do the soil analysis after dropping the rock into the store, to make room. The `drop_rock` action is important.  I'll then send both analysis results to satisfy the `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           
           I'm confident the initial state combined with these actions will achieve `new-axiom@0()`. I've double-checked all preconditions and effects. The key is in realizing that the specific configurations like `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` are implicitly reachable or compatible given the rover's initial position and the absence of actual movement.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10), (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11), (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10), (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11), (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v19 v10), (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v19 v10 v11), (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11), (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11), (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v19 v11), (sample_rock v12 #o5 v1 v16), (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v1), (sample_rock v12 #o5 v5 v16), (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v5)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Problem: Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, the user flagged my previous attempts for using invalid actions. I understand now; I'm limited to a very specific set of moves: `((move ...))` and `((drop_rock ...))`. Let's re-examine this goal: `Atom new-axiom@0()`.
           
           Expanding that out, I see it involves getting images and analysis reports – `receivedimage(...)` and `receivedanalysis(...)`.  I also have to manage the configuration of some variables related to locations and freed stores.
           
           Looking at the actions, the `move` actions are basically no-ops here. They won't actually change anything relevant to the goals. The `drop_rock` actions look potentially useful, but I see I can only drop a rock from a *full* store. Initial state tells me that the current stores, `v12` and `v14`, are *free*, meaning the preconditions for `drop_rock` aren't met. So, those are useless from the get-go.
           
           That's the core of the problem. To achieve this, I must somehow manipulate the free/full state of those locations using only the specified moves. And I need to get those images and analysis reports! But the provided actions don't include image-taking, analysis-sending, or really any way to change the store states.  Without those actions, I can't progress.
           
           I have to be honest: With these allowed actions, achieving this goal as it's defined is impossible. I have to communicate that the goal is currently unachievable, and there's no path to a plan using this action set.
