           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Problem: An Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: `new-axiom@0()`. Breaking it down, I see it's a conjunction of several conditions.  Some are already true in the initial state – like the rovers being at certain configurations and being "free." But the critical parts, the ones I need to *make* true, are about receiving images (`receivedimage`) and analyses (`receivedanalysis`).  To get those, I need actions that aren't provided. Specifically, I would need actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. However, the only actions I'm *allowed* to use are very limited: essentially moving the rovers (but not effectively moving them) and dropping rocks (but I can't even drop any since they are free).
           
           The problem *explicitly* states I can only use the provided actions, and I cannot *instantiate* any of the required actions that the goal needs since they aren't provided. Therefore, I can confidently conclude that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is *not* achievable with the given constraints. I've re-examined the preconditions for the actions I'd need, even considering if there was a subtle workaround with the given 'move' and 'drop' commands. But there isn't. The given actions don't allow for the necessary image taking, image sending, sample extraction, or analysis sending. The state of the rovers is, for all intents and purposes, locked in place.
