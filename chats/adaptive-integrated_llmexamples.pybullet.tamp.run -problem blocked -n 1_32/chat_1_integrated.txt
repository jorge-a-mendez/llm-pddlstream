User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.479, -0.415, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.233, 0.973).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.526, -0.462), (-4.432, -0.368)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The initial state describes a scene with several objects, some of which are stackable and graspable. There are two arms, v4 and v6, both currently empty. Objects v12, v8, and v15 are at specific poses on various surfaces. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which, according to the axioms, is true if `on(green, v18)` and `type(green, v17)` are true. The "green" object is not explicitly defined, but from the initial state, we know that `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`. Therefore, we can achieve the goal if either `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)` becomes true.
           
           Let's focus on `v8`. The initial state has `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`. To achieve `on(v8, v18)`, we need to place `v8` on `v18`. From the initial state, we have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`, which implies that `#o2` is a valid pose for `v8` on `v18`.
           
           The current actions available only include `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. This action just moves the base from `v3` to `v3`, effectively doing nothing useful for manipulating objects. Since there are no `pick` or `place` actions available in the `action instances` list, and the goal requires moving an object, the goal is unreachable with the given set of allowed actions. The `new-axiom@0()` can only be achieved by changing the location of object `v8` or `v12`, which requires `pick` and `place` actions.
           
           --Plan--:

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires `on(green, v18)` and `type(green, v17)`. From the initial state, `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`. Therefore, we need to place either `v8` or `v12` on `v18`. This would require `pick` and `place` actions. However, the only available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which does not allow for picking or placing objects. Therefore, the goal is unreachable with the given allowed actions.
