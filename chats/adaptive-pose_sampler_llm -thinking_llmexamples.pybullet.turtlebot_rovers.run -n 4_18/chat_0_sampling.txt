User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Strategy for Robot Base Placement**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 25 different positions for the robot base. The robot must be within 4 units of a target point, and also within the region defined by `x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5]`.  I'm given the AABB representations of the fixed obstacles.  Essentially, the goal is to make sure the robot's line of sight to the target is clear. If a position isn't valid, I must try a different one.
           
           Let's break this down. First, the environment: I have a rectangular boundary for the environment, defined as `((-2.5, -2.5), (2.5, 2.5))`, but the walls are slightly outside. I also need to consider those. Inside, there's the main challenge: a big vertical wall right at `x=0`.  This is going to significantly affect the possible placements.  Besides this central wall, the other obstacles are small rectangles, scattered around.
           
           My plan: I'll generate some potential locations, checking each location. They all have to be in the valid area and close enough to the target. Then, I need to make sure the robot doesn't collide with the fixed obstacles. Finally, there has to be a clear line of sight to the target - no obstacles in the way.
           
           To get the positions, I'll generate points on concentric circles around the target (with different radii) and then fill with random points.  I have to be very careful to exclude the ones that would cause a collision or have an obstructed line of sight.
           
           To get a diverse set of positions, I should focus on spreading them out from the target.
           
           Finally, I'll need some helper functions. I have to make sure they are very robust.  The key is the line-of-sight check. I will be doing calculations on floating-point values so I'll need to use `epsilon` values to handle small errors. And also add a small `buffer` when checking collisions to ensure the robot doesn't get *too* close. That will make sure the base is safely positioned.
           
           Let's start generating. I should be able to get 25 positions. Here's a set:
           ```
