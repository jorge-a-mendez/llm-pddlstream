           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, both equipped with a camera v10 that supports mode v11. They also both have a storage unit v16 that is currently free. There are several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and two objectives (v17, v18). There is also a lander v9. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` (already satisfied).
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` (already satisfied).
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, the rovers need to take images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 and then send them to the lander v9. For this, the camera needs to be calibrated.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, the rovers need to sample rocks of type 'stone' (v2) and 'soil' (v6), and then send the analysis to the lander v9.
           
           Based on the initial state:
           - `v1, v3, v4` are of type `v2` (stone).
           - `v5, v7, v8` are of type `v6` (soil).
           
           The plan will involve:
           1. Calibrating the camera for one of the rovers.
           2. Taking images of both objectives.
           3. Sending both images.
           4. Sampling one stone rock.
           5. Sampling one soil rock.
           6. Sending the analysis for both sampled rocks.
           
           We can use rover v14 for taking images and rover v12 for sampling and sending analysis. Or use the same rover for all of it. Given that both rovers are at their base configurations, moving one to the relevant configurations will allow us to complete all tasks.
           Rover v12 is at v13, and rover v14 is at v15.
           
           The objects v17 and v18 are far away, so we need to move the rover to a configuration where `imagevisible` is true. We see that `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` are given, so #o3 is a suitable configuration for imaging.
           The lander v9 is also far away, and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` are given, so #o0 is a suitable configuration for communicating.
           For sampling, the `above` predicate indicates configurations where the rover is above a rock. `#o5` is a suitable configuration for sampling any of the rocks.
           
           Let's use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data.
           
           **Imaging with v14:**
           1. Move v14 to #o3.
           2. Calibrate v14's camera v10 for objective v17.
           3. Take image of v17 with v14.
           4. Take image of v18 with v14 (camera is already calibrated from previous step).
           5. Move v14 to #o0.
           6. Send image of v17.
           7. Send image of v18.
           
           **Sampling and sending analysis with v12:**
           1. Move v12 to #o5.
           2. Sample rock v3 (type v2, stone).
           3. Sample rock v5 (type v6, soil).
           4. Move v12 to #o0.
           5. Send analysis of v3.
           6. Send analysis of v5.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, both equipped with a camera v10 that supports mode v11. They also both have a storage unit v16 that is currently free. There are several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and two objectives (v17, v18). There is also a lander v9. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` (already satisfied).
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` (already satisfied).
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, the rovers need to take images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 and then send them to the lander v9. For this, the camera needs to be calibrated.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, the rovers need to sample rocks of type 'stone' (v2) and 'soil' (v6), and then send the analysis to the lander v9.
           
           Based on the initial state:
           - `v1, v3, v4` are of type `v2` (stone).
           - `v5, v7, v8` are of type `v6` (soil).
           
           The plan will involve:
           1. Calibrating the camera for one of the rovers.
           2. Taking images of both objectives.
           3. Sending both images.
           4. Sampling one stone rock.
           5. Sampling one soil rock.
           6. Sending the analysis for both sampled rocks.
           
           We can use rover v14 for taking images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data. Given that both rovers are at their base configurations, moving one to the relevant configurations will allow us to complete all tasks.
           Rover v12 is at v13, and rover v14 is at v15.
           
           The objects v17 and v18 are far away. We see that `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` are given, so #o3 is a suitable configuration for imaging.
           The lander v9 is also far away, and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` are given, so #o0 is a suitable configuration for communicating.
           For sampling, the `above` predicate indicates configurations where the rover is above a rock. `#o5` is a suitable configuration for sampling any of the rocks.
           
           Let's use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data.
           
           **Imaging with v14:**
           1. Move v14 to #o3.
           2. Calibrate v14's camera v10 for objective v17.
           3. Take image of v17 with v14.
           4. Take image of v18 with v14 (camera is already calibrated from previous step).
           5. Move v14 to #o0.
           6. Send image of v17.
           7. Send image of v18.
           
           **Sampling and sending analysis with v12:**
           1. Move v12 to #o5.
           2. Sample rock v3 (type v2, stone).
           3. Sample rock v5 (type v6, soil).
           4. Move v12 to #o0.
           5. Send analysis of v3.
           6. Send analysis of v5.

           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` (already satisfied).
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, the rovers need to take images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 and then send them to the lander v9. For this, the camera needs to be calibrated.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, the rovers need to sample rocks of type 'stone' (v2) and 'soil' (v6), and then send the analysis to the lander v9.
           
           Based on the initial state:
           - `v1, v3, v4` are of type `v2` (stone).
           - `v5, v7, v8` are of type `v6` (soil).
           
           The plan will involve:
           1. Calibrating the camera for one of the rovers.
           2. Taking images of both objectives.
           3. Sending both images.
           4. Sampling one stone rock.
           5. Sampling one soil rock.
           6. Sending the analysis for both sampled rocks.
           
           We can use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data. Given that both rovers are at their base configurations, moving one to the relevant configurations will allow us to complete all tasks.
           Rover v12 is at v13, and rover v14 is at v15.
           
           The objects v17 and v18 are far away. We see that `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` are given, so #o3 is a suitable configuration for imaging.
           The lander v9 is also far away, and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` are given, so #o0 is a suitable configuration for communicating.
           For sampling, the `above` predicate indicates configurations where the rover is above a rock. `#o5` is a suitable configuration for sampling any of the rocks.
           
           Let's use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data.
           
           **Imaging with v14:**
           1. Move v14 to #o3.
           2. Calibrate v14's camera v10 for objective v17.
           3. Take image of v17 with v14.
           4. Take image of v18 with v14 (camera is already calibrated from previous step).
           5. Move v14 to #o0.
           6. Send image of v17.
           7. Send image of v18.
           
           **Sampling and sending analysis with v12:**
           1. Move v12 to #o5.
           2. Sample rock v3 (type v2, stone).
           3. Sample rock v5 (type v6, soil).
           4. Move v12 to #o0.
           5. Send analysis of v3.
           6. Send analysis of v5.

           We can use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data. Given that both rovers are at their base configurations, moving one to the relevant configurations will allow us to complete all tasks.
           Rover v12 is at v13, and rover v14 is at v15.
           
           The objects v17 and v18 are far away. We see that `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` are given, so #o3 is a suitable configuration for imaging.
           The lander v9 is also far away, and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` are given, so #o0 is a suitable configuration for communicating.
           For sampling, the `above` predicate indicates configurations where the rover is above a rock. `#o5` is a suitable configuration for sampling any of the rocks.
           
           Let's use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data.
           
           **Imaging with v14:**
           1. Move v14 to #o3.
           2. Calibrate v14's camera v10 for objective v17.
           3. Take image of v17 with v14.
           4. Take image of v18 with v14 (camera is already calibrated from previous step).
           5. Move v14 to #o0.
           6. Send image of v17.
           7. Send image of v18.

           1. Move v12 to #o5.
           2. Sample rock v3 (type v2, stone).
           3. Sample rock v5 (type v6, soil).
           4. Move v12 to #o0.
           5. Send analysis of v3.
           6. Send analysis of v5.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, both equipped with a camera v10 that supports mode v11. They also both have a storage unit v16 that is currently free. There are several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and two objectives (v17, v18). There is also a lander v9. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` (already satisfied).
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` (already satisfied).
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, the rovers need to take images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 and then send them to the lander v9. For this, the camera needs to be calibrated.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, the rovers need to sample rocks of type 'stone' (v2) and 'soil' (v6), and then send the analysis to the lander v9.
           
           Based on the initial state:
           - `v1, v3, v4` are of type `v2` (stone).
           - `v5, v7, v8` are of type `v6` (soil).
           
           The plan will involve:
           1. Calibrating the camera for one of the rovers.
           2. Taking images of both objectives.
           3. Sending both images.
           4. Sampling one stone rock.
           5. Sampling one soil rock.
           6. Sending the analysis for both sampled rocks.
           
           We can use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data. Given that both rovers are at their base configurations, moving one to the relevant configurations will allow us to complete all tasks.

           The lander v9 is also far away, and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` are given, so #o0 is a suitable configuration for communicating.

           7. Send image of v18.
           
           **Sampling and sending analysis with v12:**
           1. Move v12 to #o5.
           2. Sample rock v3 (type v2, stone).
           3. Sample rock v5 (type v6, soil).

           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, the rovers need to take images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 and then send them to the lander v9. For this, the camera needs to be calibrated.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, the rovers need to sample rocks of type 'stone' (v2) and 'soil' (v6), and then send the analysis to the lander v9.
           
           Based on the initial state:
           - `v1, v3, v4` are of type `v2` (stone).
           - `v5, v7, v8` are of type `v6` (soil).

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, both equipped with a camera v10 that supports mode v11. They also both have a storage unit v16 that is currently free. There are several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and two objectives (v17, v18). There is also a lander v9. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` (already satisfied).
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` (already satisfied).
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, the rovers need to take images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 and then send them to the lander v9. For this, the camera needs to be calibrated.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, the rovers need to sample rocks of type 'stone' (v2) and 'soil' (v6), and then send the analysis to the lander v9.
           
           Based on the initial state:
           - `v1, v3, v4` are of type `v2` (stone).
           - `v5, v7, v8` are of type `v6` (soil).
           
           The plan will involve:
           1. Calibrating the camera for one of the rovers.
           2. Taking images of both objectives.
           3. Sending both images.
           4. Sampling one stone rock.
           5. Sampling one soil rock.
           6. Sending the analysis for both sampled rocks.
           
           We can use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data. Given that both rovers are at their base configurations, moving one to the relevant configurations will allow us to complete all tasks.
           Rover v12 is at v13, and rover v14 is at v15.
           
           The objects v17 and v18 are far away. We see that `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` are given, so #o3 is a suitable configuration for imaging.
           The lander v9 is also far away, and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` are given, so #o0 is a suitable configuration for communicating.
           For sampling, the `above` predicate indicates configurations where the rover is above a rock. `#o5` is a suitable configuration for sampling any of the rocks.
           
           Let's use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data.
           
           **Imaging with v14:**

           2. Calibrate v14's camera v10 for objective v17.
           3. Take image of v17 with v14.
           4. Take image of v18 with v14 (camera is already calibrated from previous step).
           5. Move v14 to #o0.
           6. Send image of v17.
           7. Send image of v18.
           
           **Sampling and sending analysis with v12:**
           1. Move v12 to #o5.
           2. Sample rock v3 (type v2, stone).
           3. Sample rock v5 (type v6, soil).
           4. Move v12 to #o0.
           5. Send analysis of v3.

           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, the rovers need to take images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 and then send them to the lander v9. For this, the camera needs to be calibrated.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, the rovers need to sample rocks of type 'stone' (v2) and 'soil' (v6), and then send the analysis to the lander v9.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, both equipped with a camera v10 that supports mode v11. They also both have a storage unit v16 that is currently free. There are several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and two objectives (v17, v18). There is also a lander v9. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` (already satisfied).
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` (already satisfied).
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, the rovers need to take images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 and then send them to the lander v9. For this, the camera needs to be calibrated.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, the rovers need to sample rocks of type 'stone' (v2) and 'soil' (v6), and then send the analysis to the lander v9.
           
           Based on the initial state:
           - `v1, v3, v4` are of type `v2` (stone).
           - `v5, v7, v8` are of type `v6` (soil).
           
           The plan will involve:
           1. Calibrating the camera for one of the rovers.
           2. Taking images of both objectives.
           3. Sending both images.
           4. Sampling one stone rock.
           5. Sampling one soil rock.
           6. Sending the analysis for both sampled rocks.
           
           We can use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data. Given that both rovers are at their base configurations, moving one to the relevant configurations will allow us to complete all tasks.
           Rover v12 is at v13, and rover v14 is at v15.
           
           The objects v17 and v18 are far away. We see that `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` are given, so #o3 is a suitable configuration for imaging.
           The lander v9 is also far away, and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` are given, so #o0 is a suitable configuration for communicating.
           For sampling, the `above` predicate indicates configurations where the rover is above a rock. `#o5` is a suitable configuration for sampling any of the rocks.
           
           Let's use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data.
           
           **Imaging with v14:**
           1. Move v14 to #o3.
           2. Calibrate v14's camera v10 for objective v17.
           3. Take image of v17 with v14.
           4. Take image of v18 with v14 (camera is already calibrated from previous step).
           5. Move v14 to #o0.
           6. Send image of v17.
           7. Send image of v18.
           
           **Sampling and sending analysis with v12:**
           1. Move v12 to #o5.
           2. Sample rock v3 (type v2, stone).
           3. Sample rock v5 (type v6, soil).
           4. Move v12 to #o0.
           5. Send analysis of v3.
           6. Send analysis of v5.

There are several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and two objectives (v17, v18). There is also a lander v9. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` (already satisfied).
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` (already satisfied).
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, the rovers need to take images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 and then send them to the lander v9. For this, the camera needs to be calibrated.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, the rovers need to sample rocks of type 'stone' (v2) and 'soil' (v6), and then send the analysis to the lander v9.
           
           Based on the initial state:
           - `v1, v3, v4` are of type `v2` (stone).
           - `v5, v7, v8` are of type `v6` (soil).
           
           The plan will involve:
           1. Calibrating the camera for one of the rovers.
           2. Taking images of both objectives.
           3. Sending both images.
           4. Sampling one stone rock.
           5. Sampling one soil rock.
           6. Sending the analysis for both sampled rocks.
           
           We can use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data. Given that both rovers are at their base configurations, moving one to the relevant configurations will allow us to complete all tasks.
           Rover v12 is at v13, and rover v14 is at v15.
           
           The objects v17 and v18 are far away. We see that `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` are given, so #o3 is a suitable configuration for imaging.
           The lander v9 is also far away, and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` are given, so #o0 is a suitable configuration for communicating.
           For sampling, the `above` predicate indicates configurations where the rover is above a rock. `#o5` is a suitable configuration for sampling any of the rocks.
           
           Let's use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data.
           
           **Imaging with v14:**
           1. Move v14 to #o3.
           2. Calibrate v14's camera v10 for objective v17.
           3. Take image of v17 with v14.
           4. Take image of v18 with v14 (camera is already calibrated from previous step).
           5. Move v14 to #o0.
           6. Send image of v17.
           7. Send image of v18.
           
           **Sampling and sending analysis with v12:**
           1. Move v12 to #o5.
           2. Sample rock v3 (type v2, stone).
           3. Sample rock v5 (type v6, soil).
           4. Move v12 to #o0.
           5. Send analysis of v3.
           6. Send analysis of v5.

           3. Sending both images.
           4. Sampling one stone rock.
           5. Sampling one soil rock.
           6. Sending the analysis for both sampled rocks.
           
           We can use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data. Given that both rovers are at their base configurations, moving one to the relevant configurations will allow us to complete all tasks.
           Rover v12 is at v13, and rover v14 is at v15.
           
           The objects v17 and v18 are far away. We see that `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` are given, so #o3 is a suitable configuration for imaging.
           The lander v9 is also far away, and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` are given, so #o0 is a suitable configuration for communicating.
           For sampling, the `above` predicate indicates configurations where the rover is above a rock. `#o5` is a suitable configuration for sampling any of the rocks.
           
           Let's use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data.
           
           **Imaging with v14:**
           1. Move v14 to #o3.
           2. Calibrate v14's camera v10 for objective v17.
           3. Take image of v17 with v14.
           4. Take image of v18 with v14 (camera is already calibrated from previous step).
           5. Move v14 to #o0.
           6. Send image of v17.
           7. Send image of v18.

           2. Sample rock v3 (type v2, stone).
           3. Sample rock v5 (type v6, soil).
           4. Move v12 to #o0.
           5. Send analysis of v3.
           6. Send analysis of v5.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, both equipped with a camera v10 that supports mode v11. They also both have a storage unit v16 that is currently free. There are several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and two objectives (v17, v18). There is also a lander v9. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` (already satisfied).
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` (already satisfied).
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, the rovers need to take images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 and then send them to the lander v9. For this, the camera needs to be calibrated.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, the rovers need to sample rocks of type 'stone' (v2) and 'soil' (v6), and then send the analysis to the lander v9.
           
           Based on the initial state:
           - `v1, v3, v4` are of type `v2` (stone).
           - `v5, v7, v8` are of type `v6` (soil).
           
           The plan will involve:
           1. Calibrating the camera for one of the rovers.
           2. Taking images of both objectives.
           3. Sending both images.
           4. Sampling one stone rock.
           5. Sampling one soil rock.
           6. Sending the analysis for both sampled rocks.
           
           We can use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data. Given that both rovers are at their base configurations, moving one to the relevant configurations will allow us to complete all tasks.

           The lander v9 is also far away, and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` are given, so #o0 is a suitable configuration for communicating.

           7. Send image of v18.
           
           **Sampling and sending analysis with v12:**
           1. Move v12 to #o5.
           2. Sample rock v3 (type v2, stone).
           3. Sample rock v5 (type v6, soil).

           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, the rovers need to take images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 and then send them to the lander v9. For this, the camera needs to be calibrated.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, the rovers need to sample rocks of type 'stone' (v2) and 'soil' (v6), and then send the analysis to the lander v9.
           
           Based on the initial state:
           - `v1, v3, v4` are of type `v2` (stone).
           - `v5, v7, v8` are of type `v6` (soil).
           
           The plan will involve:

           The lander v9 is also far away, and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` are given, so #o0 is a suitable configuration for communicating.
           For sampling, the `above` predicate indicates configurations where the rover is above a rock. `#o5` is a suitable configuration for sampling any of the rocks.
           
           Let's use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data.
           
           **Imaging with v14:**
           1. Move v14 to #o3.
           2. Calibrate v14's camera v10 for objective v17.
           3. Take image of v17 with v14.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, both equipped with a camera v10 that supports mode v11. They also both have a storage unit v16 that is currently free. There are several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and two objectives (v17, v18). There is also a lander v9. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` (already satisfied).
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` (already satisfied).
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, the rovers need to take images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 and then send them to the lander v9. For this, the camera needs to be calibrated.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, the rovers need to sample rocks of type 'stone' (v2) and 'soil' (v6), and then send the analysis to the lander v9.
           
           Based on the initial state:
           - `v1, v3, v4` are of type `v2` (stone).
           - `v5, v7, v8` are of type `v6` (soil).
           
           The plan will involve:
           1. Calibrating the camera for one of the rovers.
           2. Taking images of both objectives.
           3. Sending both images.
           4. Sampling one stone rock.
           5. Sampling one soil rock.
           6. Sending the analysis for both sampled rocks.
           
           We can use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data. Given that both rovers are at their base configurations, moving one to the relevant configurations will allow us to complete all tasks.
           Rover v12 is at v13, and rover v14 is at v15.
           
           The objects v17 and v18 are far away. We see that `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` are given, so #o3 is a suitable configuration for imaging.
           The lander v9 is also far away, and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` are given, so #o0 is a suitable configuration for communicating.
           For sampling, the `above` predicate indicates configurations where the rover is above a rock. `#o5` is a suitable configuration for sampling any of the rocks.
           
           Let's use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data.
           
           **Imaging with v14:**

           2. Calibrate v14's camera v10 for objective v17.
           3. Take image of v17 with v14.
           4. Take image of v18 with v14 (camera is already calibrated from previous step).
           5. Move v14 to #o0.
           6. Send image of v17.
           7. Send image of v18.
           
           **Sampling and sending analysis with v12:**
           1. Move v12 to #o5.
           2. Sample rock v3 (type v2, stone).
           3. Sample rock v5 (type v6, soil).
           4. Move v12 to #o0.
           5. Send analysis of v3.

           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, the rovers need to take images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 and then send them to the lander v9. For this, the camera needs to be calibrated.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, the rovers need to sample rocks of type 'stone' (v2) and 'soil' (v6), and then send the analysis to the lander v9.
           
           Based on the initial state:

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, both equipped with a camera v10 that supports mode v11. They also both have a storage unit v16 that is currently free. There are several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and two objectives (v17, v18). There is also a lander v9. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` (already satisfied).
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` (already satisfied).
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, the rovers need to take images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 and then send them to the lander v9. For this, the camera needs to be calibrated.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, the rovers need to sample rocks of type 'stone' (v2) and 'soil' (v6), and then send the analysis to the lander v9.
           
           Based on the initial state:
           - `v1, v3, v4` are of type `v2` (stone).
           - `v5, v7, v8` are of type `v6` (soil).
           
           The plan will involve:
           1. Calibrating the camera for one of the rovers.
           2. Taking images of both objectives.
           3. Sending both images.
           4. Sampling one stone rock.
           5. Sampling one soil rock.
           6. Sending the analysis for both sampled rocks.
           
           We can use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data. Given that both rovers are at their base configurations, moving one to the relevant configurations will allow us to complete all tasks.
           Rover v12 is at v13, and rover v14 is at v15.
           
           The objects v17 and v18 are far away. We see that `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` are given, so #o3 is a suitable configuration for imaging.
           The lander v9 is also far away, and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` are given, so #o0 is a suitable configuration for communicating.
           For sampling, the `above` predicate indicates configurations where the rover is above a rock. `#o5` is a suitable configuration for sampling any of the rocks.
           
           Let's use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data.
           
           **Imaging with v14:**
           1. Move v14 to #o3.
           2. Calibrate v14's camera v10 for objective v17.
           3. Take image of v17 with v14.
           4. Take image of v18 with v14 (camera is already calibrated from previous step).
           5. Move v14 to #o0.
           6. Send image of v17.
           7. Send image of v18.
           
           **Sampling and sending analysis with v12:**
           1. Move v12 to #o5.
           2. Sample rock v3 (type v2, stone).
           3. Sample rock v5 (type v6, soil).
           4. Move v12 to #o0.
           5. Send analysis of v3.
           6. Send analysis of v5.

           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, the rovers need to take images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 and then send them to the lander v9. For this, the camera needs to be calibrated.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, the rovers need to sample rocks of type 'stone' (v2) and 'soil' (v6), and then send the analysis to the lander v9.
           
           Based on the initial state:

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, both equipped with a camera v10 that supports mode v11. They also both have a storage unit v16 that is currently free. There are several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and two objectives (v17, v18). There is also a lander v9. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` (already satisfied).
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` (already satisfied).
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, the rovers need to take images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 and then send them to the lander v9. For this, the camera needs to be calibrated.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, the rovers need to sample rocks of type 'stone' (v2) and 'soil' (v6), and then send the analysis to the lander v9.
           
           Based on the initial state:
           - `v1, v3, v4` are of type `v2` (stone).
           - `v5, v7, v8` are of type `v6` (soil).
           
           The plan will involve:
           1. Calibrating the camera for one of the rovers.
           2. Taking images of both objectives.
           3. Sending both images.
           4. Sampling one stone rock.
           5. Sampling one soil rock.
           6. Sending the analysis for both sampled rocks.
           
           We can use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data. Given that both rovers are at their base configurations, moving one to the relevant configurations will allow us to complete all tasks.
           Rover v12 is at v13, and rover v14 is at v15.
           
           The objects v17 and v18 are far away. We see that `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` are given, so #o3 is a suitable configuration for imaging.
           The lander v9 is also far away, and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` are given, so #o0 is a suitable configuration for communicating.
           For sampling, the `above` predicate indicates configurations where the rover is above a rock. `#o5` is a suitable configuration for sampling any of the rocks.
           
           Let's use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data.
           
           **Imaging with v14:**
           1. Move v14 to #o3.
           2. Calibrate v14's camera v10 for objective v17.
           3. Take image of v17 with v14.
           4. Take image of v18 with v14 (camera is already calibrated from previous step).
           5. Move v14 to #o0.
           6. Send image of v17.
           7. Send image of v18.
           
           **Sampling and sending analysis with v12:**
           1. Move v12 to #o5.
           2. Sample rock v3 (type v2, stone).
           3. Sample rock v5 (type v6, soil).
           4. Move v12 to #o0.
           5. Send analysis of v3.
           6. Send analysis of v5.

           1. Calibrating the camera for one of the rovers.
           2. Taking images of both objectives.
           3. Sending both images.
           4. Sampling one stone rock.
           5. Sampling one soil rock.
           6. Sending the analysis for both sampled rocks.
           
           We can use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data. Given that both rovers are at their base configurations, moving one to the relevant configurations will allow us to complete all tasks.
           Rover v12 is at v13, and rover v14 is at v15.
           
           The objects v17 and v18 are far away. We see that `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` are given, so #o3 is a suitable configuration for imaging.
           The lander v9 is also far away, and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` are given, so #o0 is a suitable configuration for communicating.
           For sampling, the `above` predicate indicates configurations where the rover is above a rock. `#o5` is a suitable configuration for sampling any of the rocks.
           
           Let's use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data.
           
           **Imaging with v14:**
           1. Move v14 to #o3.
           2. Calibrate v14's camera v10 for objective v17.
           3. Take image of v17 with v14.
           4. Take image of v18 with v14 (camera is already calibrated from previous step).
           5. Move v14 to #o0.
           6. Send image of v17.
           7. Send image of v18.
           
           **Sampling and sending analysis with v12:**
           1. Move v12 to #o5.
           2. Sample rock v3 (type v2, stone).
           3. Sample rock v5 (type v6, soil).
           4. Move v12 to #o0.
           5. Send analysis of v3.
           6. Send analysis of v5.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, both equipped with a camera v10 that supports mode v11. They also both have a storage unit v16 that is currently free. There are several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and two objectives (v17, v18). There is also a lander v9. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` (already satisfied).
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` (already satisfied).
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, the rovers need to take images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 and then send them to the lander v9. For this, the camera needs to be calibrated.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, the rovers need to sample rocks of type 'stone' (v2) and 'soil' (v6), and then send the analysis to the lander v9.
           
           Based on the initial state:
           - `v1, v3, v4` are of type `v2` (stone).
           - `v5, v7, v8` are of type `v6` (soil).
           
           The plan will involve:
           1. Calibrating the camera for one of the rovers.
           2. Taking images of both objectives.
           3. Sending both images.
           4. Sampling one stone rock.
           5. Sampling one soil rock.
           6. Sending the analysis for both sampled rocks.
           
           We can use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data. Given that both rovers are at their base configurations, moving one to the relevant configurations will allow us to complete all tasks.

           The lander v9 is also far away, and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` are given, so #o0 is a suitable configuration for communicating.

           3. Sample rock v5 (type v6, soil).

           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, the rovers need to take images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 and then send them to the lander v9. For this, the camera needs to be calibrated.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, the rovers need to sample rocks of type 'stone' (v2) and 'soil' (v6), and then send the analysis to the lander v9.
           
           Based on the initial state:
           - `v1, v3, v4` are of type `v2` (stone).
           - `v5, v7, v8` are of type `v6` (soil).

           3. Sending both images.
           4. Sampling one stone rock.
           5. Sampling one soil rock.

           The lander v9 is also far away, and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` are given, so #o0 is a suitable configuration for communicating.
           For sampling, the `above` predicate indicates configurations where the rover is above a rock. `#o5` is a suitable configuration for sampling any of the rocks.
           
           Let's use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data.
           
           **Imaging with v14:**
           1. Move v14 to #o3.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, both equipped with a camera v10 that supports mode v11. They also both have a storage unit v16 that is currently free. There are several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and two objectives (v17, v18). There is also a lander v9. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` (already satisfied).
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` (already satisfied).
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, the rovers need to take images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 and then send them to the lander v9. For this, the camera needs to be calibrated.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, the rovers need to sample rocks of type 'stone' (v2) and 'soil' (v6), and then send the analysis to the lander v9.
           
           Based on the initial state:
           - `v1, v3, v4` are of type `v2` (stone).
           - `v5, v7, v8` are of type `v6` (soil).
           
           The plan will involve:
           1. Calibrating the camera for one of the rovers.
           2. Taking images of both objectives.
           3. Sending both images.
           4. Sampling one stone rock.
           5. Sampling one soil rock.
           6. Sending the analysis for both sampled rocks.
           
           We can use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data. Given that both rovers are at their base configurations, moving one to the relevant configurations will allow us to complete all tasks.
           Rover v12 is at v13, and rover v14 is at v15.
           
           The objects v17 and v18 are far away. We see that `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` are given, so #o3 is a suitable configuration for imaging.
           The lander v9 is also far away, and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` are given, so #o0 is a suitable configuration for communicating.
           For sampling, the `above` predicate indicates configurations where the rover is above a rock. `#o5` is a suitable configuration for sampling any of the rocks.
           
           Let's use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data.

           3. Take image of v17 with v14.
           4. Take image of v18 with v14 (camera is already calibrated from previous step).
           5. Move v14 to #o0.
           6. Send image of v17.
           7. Send image of v18.
           
           **Sampling and sending analysis with v12:**
           1. Move v12 to #o5.
           2. Sample rock v3 (type v2, stone).
           3. Sample rock v5 (type v6, soil).
           4. Move v12 to #o0.
           5. Send analysis of v3.

           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, the rovers need to take images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 and then send them to the lander v9. For this, the camera needs to be calibrated.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, the rovers need to sample rocks of type 'stone' (v2) and 'soil' (v6), and then send the analysis to the lander v9.
           
           Based on the initial state:
           - `v1, v3, v4` are of type `v2` (stone).
           - `v5, v7, v8` are of type `v6` (soil).

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, both equipped with a camera v10 that supports mode v11. They also both have a storage unit v16 that is currently free. There are several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and two objectives (v17, v18). There is also a lander v9. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` (already satisfied).
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` (already satisfied).
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, the rovers need to take images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 and then send them to the lander v9. For this, the camera needs to be calibrated.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, the rovers need to sample rocks of type 'stone' (v2) and 'soil' (v6), and then send the analysis to the lander v9.
           
           Based on the initial state:
           - `v1, v3, v4` are of type `v2` (stone).
           - `v5, v7, v8` are of type `v6` (soil).
           
           The plan will involve:
           1. Calibrating the camera for one of the rovers.
           2. Taking images of both objectives.
           3. Sending both images.
           4. Sampling one stone rock.
           5. Sampling one soil rock.
           6. Sending the analysis for both sampled rocks.
           
           We can use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data. Given that both rovers are at their base configurations, moving one to the relevant configurations will allow us to complete all tasks.
           Rover v12 is at v13, and rover v14 is at v15.
           
           The objects v17 and v18 are far away. We see that `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` are given, so #o3 is a suitable configuration for imaging.
           The lander v9 is also far away, and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` are given, so #o0 is a suitable configuration for communicating.
           For sampling, the `above` predicate indicates configurations where the rover is above a rock. `#o5` is a suitable configuration for sampling any of the rocks.
           
           Let's use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data.
           
           **Imaging with v14:**
           1. Move v14 to #o3.
           2. Calibrate v14's camera v10 for objective v17.
           3. Take image of v17 with v14.
           4. Take image of v18 with v14 (camera is already calibrated from previous step).
           5. Move v14 to #o0.
           6. Send image of v17.
           7. Send image of v18.
           
           **Sampling and sending analysis with v12:**
           1. Move v12 to #o5.
           2. Sample rock v3 (type v2, stone).
           3. Sample rock v5 (type v6, soil).
           4. Move v12 to #o0.
           5. Send analysis of v3.
           6. Send analysis of v5.

           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, the rovers need to sample rocks of type 'stone' (v2) and 'soil' (v6), and then send the analysis to the lander v9.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, both equipped with a camera v10 that supports mode v11. They also both have a storage unit v16 that is currently free. There are several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and two objectives (v17, v18). There is also a lander v9. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` (already satisfied).
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` (already satisfied).
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, the rovers need to take images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 and then send them to the lander v9. For this, the camera needs to be calibrated.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, the rovers need to sample rocks of type 'stone' (v2) and 'soil' (v6), and then send the analysis to the lander v9.
           
           Based on the initial state:
           - `v1, v3, v4` are of type `v2` (stone).
           - `v5, v7, v8` are of type `v6` (soil).
           
           The plan will involve:
           1. Calibrating the camera for one of the rovers.
           2. Taking images of both objectives.
           3. Sending both images.
           4. Sampling one stone rock.
           5. Sampling one soil rock.
           6. Sending the analysis for both sampled rocks.
           
           We can use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data. Given that both rovers are at their base configurations, moving one to the relevant configurations will allow us to complete all tasks.
           Rover v12 is at v13, and rover v14 is at v15.
           
           The objects v17 and v18 are far away. We see that `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` are given, so #o3 is a suitable configuration for imaging.
           The lander v9 is also far away, and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` are given, so #o0 is a suitable configuration for communicating.
           For sampling, the `above` predicate indicates configurations where the rover is above a rock. `#o5` is a suitable configuration for sampling any of the rocks.
           
           Let's use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data.
           
           **Imaging with v14:**
           1. Move v14 to #o3.
           2. Calibrate v14's camera v10 for objective v17.
           3. Take image of v17 with v14.
           4. Take image of v18 with v14 (camera is already calibrated from previous step).
           5. Move v14 to #o0.
           6. Send image of v17.
           7. Send image of v18.
           
           **Sampling and sending analysis with v12:**
           1. Move v12 to #o5.
           2. Sample rock v3 (type v2, stone).
           3. Sample rock v5 (type v6, soil).
           4. Move v12 to #o0.
           5. Send analysis of v3.
           6. Send analysis of v5.

           - `v1, v3, v4` are of type `v2` (stone).
           - `v5, v7, v8` are of type `v6` (soil).
           
           The plan will involve:
           1. Calibrating the camera for one of the rovers.
           2. Taking images of both objectives.
           3. Sending both images.
           4. Sampling one stone rock.
           5. Sampling one soil rock.
           6. Sending the analysis for both sampled rocks.
           
           We can use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data. Given that both rovers are at their base configurations, moving one to the relevant configurations will allow us to complete all tasks.
           Rover v12 is at v13, and rover v14 is at v15.
           
           The objects v17 and v18 are far away. We see that `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` are given, so #o3 is a suitable configuration for imaging.
           The lander v9 is also far away, and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` are given, so #o0 is a suitable configuration for communicating.
           For sampling, the `above` predicate indicates configurations where the rover is above a rock. `#o5` is a suitable configuration for sampling any of the rocks.
           
           Let's use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data.
           
           **Imaging with v14:**
           1. Move v14 to #o3.
           2. Calibrate v14's camera v10 for objective v17.
           3. Take image of v17 with v14.
           4. Take image of v18 with v14 (camera is already calibrated from previous step).
           5. Move v14 to #o0.
           6. Send image of v17.
           7. Send image of v18.
           
           **Sampling and sending analysis with v12:**
           1. Move v12 to #o5.
           2. Sample rock v3 (type v2, stone).
           3. Sample rock v5 (type v6, soil).
           4. Move v12 to #o0.
           5. Send analysis of v3.
           6. Send analysis of v5.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, both equipped with a camera v10 that supports mode v11. They also both have a storage unit v16 that is currently free. There are several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and two objectives (v17, v18). There is also a lander v9. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` (already satisfied).

           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, the rovers need to take images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 and then send them to the lander v9. For this, the camera needs to be calibrated.

           - `v1, v3, v4` are of type `v2` (stone).
           - `v5, v7, v8` are of type `v6` (soil).

           Let's use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data.
           
           **Imaging with v14:**
           1. Move v14 to #o3.
           2. Calibrate v14's camera v10 for objective v17.
           3. Take image of v17 with v14.
           4. Take image of v18 with v14 (camera is already calibrated from previous step).
           5. Move v14 to #o0.
           6. Send image of v17.
           7. Send image of v18.
           
           **Sampling and sending analysis with v12:**
           1. Move v12 to #o5.
           2. Sample rock v3 (type v2, stone).
           3. Sample rock v5 (type v6, soil).
           4. Move v12 to #o0.
           5. Send analysis of v3.
           6. Send analysis of v5.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, both equipped with a camera v10 that supports mode v11. They also both have a storage unit v16 that is currently free. There are several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and two objectives (v17, v18). There is also a lander v9. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` (already satisfied).
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` (already satisfied).
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, the rovers need to take images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 and then send them to the lander v9. For this, the camera needs to be calibrated.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, the rovers need to sample rocks of type 'stone' (v2) and 'soil' (v6), and then send the analysis to the lander v9.
           
           Based on the initial state:
           - `v1, v3, v4` are of type `v2` (stone).
           - `v5, v7, v8` are of type `v6` (soil).
           
           The plan will involve:
           1. Calibrating the camera for one of the rovers.
           2. Taking images of both objectives.
           3. Sending both images.
           4. Sampling one stone rock.
           5. Sampling one soil rock.
           6. Sending the analysis for both sampled rocks.
           
           We can use rover v14 for images and rover v12 for sampling and sending data. Given that both rovers are at their base configurations, moving one to the relevant configurations will allow us to complete all tasks.
           Rover v12 is at v13, and rover v14 is at v15.
           
           The objects v17 and v18 are far away. We see that `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` are given, so #o3 is a suitable configuration for imaging.
           The lander v9 is also far away, and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` are given, so #o0 is a suitable configuration for communicating.
           For sampling, the `above` predicate indicates configurations where the rover is above a rock. `#o5` is a suitable configuration for sampling any of the rocks.
