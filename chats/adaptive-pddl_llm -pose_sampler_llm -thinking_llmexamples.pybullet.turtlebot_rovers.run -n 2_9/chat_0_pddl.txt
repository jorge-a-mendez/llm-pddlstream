           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning about Goal Achievement in the Rovers Domain**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with the goal `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain, and my first step is to unpack its meaning. Essentially, it's a conjunction of several conditions: being at certain configurations, having certain things free, having received images, and having received analyses of both stone and soil.  Initially, the conditions regarding being `atconf` and having things `free` are already true. However, the conditions regarding `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` are not.
           
           My next step is to examine the allowed actions. The only permitted actions are `move` and `drop_rock`. No actions related to image capture, analysis, or transmission are allowed.  This is a significant constraint, given the goal.  I know that to get a `receivedimage`, I'd need to use a `send_image` action and to get a `receivedanalysis`, I'd need a `send_analysis` action. But these actions are explicitly prohibited.
           
           I've also meticulously reviewed the initial state. I've noted that there are stones and soil available, and I would need to analyze them in order to meet the goal.  I know that to sample or analyze a rock I'd need to use a  `sample_rock` action and to send the analyses to the lander I would need to use a `send_analysis` action. But these actions are explicitly prohibited.
           
           I've carefully examined the `move` actions and the `drop_rock` actions.  Since `drop_rock` has a precondition `full`, and since the initial state indicates that the rovers are not full, this action is also inapplicable.   Essentially, the problem boils down to this: to achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` conditions, I need to *create* these facts using actions that are *not* allowed. I've double-checked my understanding of axioms, but they aren't helping. I'm hitting a wall here.
           
           The key is the "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." That's the crux.  It seems the problem is unsolvable given the action constraints. I cannot *generate* the necessary facts with the available actions.  Therefore, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable. It's a fundamental mismatch between the desired outcome and the allowed actions.
