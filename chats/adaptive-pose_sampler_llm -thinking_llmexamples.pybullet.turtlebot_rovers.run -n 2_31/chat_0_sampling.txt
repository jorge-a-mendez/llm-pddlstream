User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my plan for finding those three robot base positions. I need to make sure they're within two units of the target point, don't bump into anything, and can 'see' the target. I'm given the obstacle positions as bounding boxes, and I need to output the results in a specific format.**
           
           First, I need to understand the obstacles: There's a big environment boundary, four walls just outside the main working space, and a central wall at x=0 that's going to be a real problem.  I'll need to keep those in mind, especially the central wall.
           
           My strategy is to:
           1.  Come up with candidate positions near the target (within the range of 2).
           2.  Kick out any that are inside an obstacle.
           3.  For the ones left, check that the line from the base to the target doesn't run into anything.
           4.  Make sure the positions stay within the boundary of the grid.
           
           To check if a point is in an obstacle, I will use a function to determine if any of the obstacles' min_x <= px <= max_x and min_y <= py <= max_y.
           
           For line-of-sight, I'll check if the line from the base position to the target intersects any obstacle bounding box. For now, I'll simplify the check to check if the obstacle's center is on the line, or if the obstacle is close to the line.
           
           The goal is to provide three positions that are reasonably spaced out.
           
           **The Target:** The target point is at (1.0, 1.0). The central wall is at x=0, and since the target is at x=1.0, I want to make sure my robot base is also on the positive x-side (x > 0.05).
           
           **Now, let's start generating the positions:**
           
           1.  I started with (2.0, 1.0), which is 1 unit to the right of the target.
           2.  Next, I tried (1.0, -0.5), which is 1.5 units below the target.
           3.  Then I added (1.7071, 1.7071), which is 1 unit above and to the right.
           4.  Lastly, I came up with (2.2728, -0.2728) at 1.8 units away, to the bottom right.
           
           I checked for collisions and that the robot could 'see' the target from all of these positions. I then used a more advanced line-of-sight test to confirm the path.
           
           **So, my final chosen positions (in the required format) are:**
           
           *   (2.0 1.0)
           *   (1.0 -0.5)
           *   (2.2728 -0.2728)
           
)
