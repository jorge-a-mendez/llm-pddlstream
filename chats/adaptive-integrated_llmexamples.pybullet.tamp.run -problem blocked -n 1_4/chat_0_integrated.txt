User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.633, 0.254), (-4.542, 0.345)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.588, 0.3, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.191, 0.982).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom pose(v15, v16)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)
           Atom bconf(v3)

           Atom supported(v12, v13, v14)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)

           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom type(v8, v17)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains several objects, `v8`, `v12`, and `v15` which are graspable and stackable. `v17` is a type. `v10` is an object that can support `v8`, `v12`, `v15` at pose `#o2`. `v18` is an object that can support `v8`, `v12` at pose `#o2`. `v11` supports `v8` at `v9` and `v15` at `v16`. `v14` supports `v12` at `v13`. `v4` and `v6` are arms, and `v3` is the initial base configuration. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which means placing an object of type `v17` on `v18`. Since `v8` is of type `v17` and `v18` can support `v8`, the goal can be achieved by placing `v8` on `v18`. Currently, `v8` is at `v9` which is supported by `v11`. There is only one available action instance `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This move action does not change the state of the objects or satisfy the goal. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
