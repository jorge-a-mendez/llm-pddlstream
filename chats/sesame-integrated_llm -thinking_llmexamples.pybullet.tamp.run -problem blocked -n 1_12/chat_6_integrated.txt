           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.667, -0.287), (4.762, -0.192)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.648, 0.104), (-4.553, 0.199)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.6, 0.152, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.25, 0.968).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((3.444, -0.842), (4.798, 0.003)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.
           
           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q0', '#t1'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q0', '#q1', '#t6'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', '#p0', '#g0', '#q1', '#t2'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-traj-pose:('#t0', 'v15', 'v16')->()`, which impeded executing the action pick('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0').
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions. If the failure occurs after placing on any pose that does not start with '#', it may be due to using a combination of invalid poses.As the expert, you may decide to choose additional poses, providing their continuous values using any free pose starting with '#'. 

(Thoughts: **Strategic Analysis for Goal Achievement**
           
           My primary objective is to devise a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to placing an object onto `v18` such that it satisfies the predicate `type(?green, v17)`. Analyzing the initial state, I identify `v8` and `v12` as potential candidates since they are of type `v17`. My analysis centers on the premise of placing either object on `v18`. 
           
           The core challenge arises from a key precondition: `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)`. This axiom, as defined, stipulates that an object `?o` can only be grasped if there are no other graspable objects in the scene. The presence of multiple graspable objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v15`) renders this condition problematic, seemingly blocking any `pick` action. If this is strictly adhered to, the goal becomes unreachable.
           
           The scene details reveal a prior failure where a pick trajectory was in collision.  `v15` blocked the action.  Given that previous issue, I'm now inclined to pick `v12` as the object to place on `v18`. This object is spatially far enough away from `v15`, to avoid any collisions. Therefore, I will select `v12` as the object to be moved.
           
           To achieve my goal, I will proceed with the following four-step plan:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  First, I will relocate the base from its initial configuration (`v3`) to a suitable base configuration (`#q4`) where the arm (`v4`) can grasp `v12`.
           2.  **Pick:**  Subsequently, I will have the arm pick `v12` from its current pose (`v13`) using an appropriate grasp (`#g2`).
           3.  **Move Base:**  After that, I will move the base from configuration `#q4` to a new configuration `#q5` that is appropriate for the `place` action.
           4.  **Place:**  Finally, I will direct the arm to place `v12` onto the surface `v18` at a pre-calculated pose (`#p2`).
           
           The crux of the plan lies in overcoming the `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)` precondition for `pick`. I am making the critical assumption, given the context of a solvable problem, and that the previous failure implies an active plan may work, that this condition is satisfied by collision free motion planning.  I will then assume there is some underlying mechanism or nuance by which the pick action can be successfully executed without any other objects blocking the trajectory. This assumption is necessary to allow the pick and place steps to happen.
           
           I have chosen a target pose for object `v12` on surface `v18`. I will set the pose such that the object is placed at a height of 0.8 and in the center of the surface at `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8)`. Using these calculations, I can place the object and meet the goals.  If successful, I will have achieved the desired state where an object, namely `v12`, is of the correct type and is on `v18`.
