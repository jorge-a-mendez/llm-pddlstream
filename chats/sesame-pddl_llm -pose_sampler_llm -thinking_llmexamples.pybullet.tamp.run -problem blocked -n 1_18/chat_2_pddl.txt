(Thoughts: **The Path to New Axiom**
           
           Okay, here's my line of thinking: My primary objective is to make `new-axiom@0()` true. I see that this is essentially about getting an object, which I'll call `?green`, both "on" another object (`v18`) and of a specific "type" (`v17`). Fortunately, the "type" condition is already satisfied in the initial state. My main challenge, therefore, lies in ensuring `?green` is "on" `v18`.
           
           Since I know about the 'on' axiom, I understand that in order to have an object 'on' another object, I need two sub-conditions: The first is that the green object must be supported on the supporting object. and the second is about the position of the supported object. To satisfy this, I must find an object and place it on v18 in a pose.
           
           Looking at the initial state, I see I have some options: `v8` and `v12` could both be candidates for `?green`.  I have supported facts for both of them in relation to `v18`.  It doesn't make any difference which one I choose! I will just pick `v8` to keep things simple.
           
           Now, my strategy is to pick up `v8` from where it currently is, which is at `v9` and place it at `#p0` on `v18`, to ensure that it has a known pose. I know that `v8` is supported in `#p0` already.
           
           I will start by navigating the robot's base to the configuration. Following that, I need to check the conditions related to moving the robot's base. The action `move_base` needs the base motion as a precondition and the current pose must be the current configuration `atbconf`. In addition, I need to make sure the robot can move.
           
           To pick up the object, I'll execute the `pick` action to move the base and I need to check all the pick preconditions. I must ensure the kinematic conditions are satisfied and it's free. Following that, I'll pick up the object!
           
           Now, the focus will move towards `place`.
           Now I should move the base configuration from one to another for the place action and pick the place action. The `place` action has the exact same preconditions with slightly different variables with the same requirements.
           
           Now I have the robot arm with the object and I need to move it to `#p0` position and now I can execute the `place` action!
           
           By executing `move_base`, then `pick`, then again `move_base`, and then `place`, I believe I've got a plan that will lead to `v8` being "on" `v18`.  This is key to making `new-axiom@0()` a success. I'll make sure everything is in place, and if I execute the sequence, then everything should work.
