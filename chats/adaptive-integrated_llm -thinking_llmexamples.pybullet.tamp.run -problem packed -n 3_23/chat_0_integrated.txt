User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.269, -0.024), (-0.188, 0.058)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.07, -0.329), (0.167, -0.231)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.109, 0.34), (-0.039, 0.41)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.074, 0.375, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.706, 0.708).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.119, -0.28, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.47, 0.883).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.228, 0.017, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.093, 0.996).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Plan for Object Placement**
           
           My goal is to place three objects, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, onto surface `v16` in specific poses.  I've analyzed the initial state and available actions, and I've identified the key challenges:  generating the correct continuous parameters (specifically, poses and grasps) and establishing a safe and efficient order of operations.
           
           Here's my approach:
           
           1.  **Placement Poses:** I'll determine the precise placement poses for each object on `v16`. Since `v16` has limited space, I'll strategically arrange the objects to avoid collisions.  I will take the initial AABBs of `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, which are currently in the range  `((-0.269, -0.024), (-0.188, 0.058))`, `((0.07, -0.329), (0.167, -0.231))`, `((-0.109, 0.34), (-0.039, 0.41))` and calculate their respective widths and heights, considering they may have different sizes. Then I will place the objects in a row along the x-axis, centered on v16, to avoid collisions.
           
           2.  **Action Sequence:** The plan will involve a series of pick-and-place actions. The current poses are: `v9` for `v8`, `v13` for `v12`, and `v15` for `v14`, all with the grasping action: `#o1`. The placement will use a new grasping action. `v3` will be the base configuration.
           
           3.  **Continuous Parameter Generation:** The continuous parameters (like the `kin` and `atraj` facts needed for pick and place) are not explicitly given. I'll need to *generate* those parameters for each `pick` and `place` action. I will assume the `kin` and `atraj` parameters are valid and feasible, and that they will be derived from the object geometry, arm reachability, grasp information `#o1`.
               *   For the `place` actions, I must create *unique* poses on `v16`. I have computed them and they are:
                   *   `#o2` for `v8` = `(-0.09, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)`
                   *   `#o2` for `v12` = `(-0.001, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)`
                   *   `#o2` for `v14` = `(0.0825, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)`
                   I will map those computed values to the shared *parameter* name `#o2`, but provide a different concrete *value* for each object.
           
           4.  **Collision Avoidance:** During pose generation, I'll need to take the initial AABBs and surface AABBs into account for safety checks to ensure the pick and place trajectories and placement poses are collision-free.
           
           I'm making a critical assumption here:  that I'm allowed to *generate* `pick` and `place` actions even if they're not explicitly listed as action instances. If that assumption is incorrect, then this plan cannot succeed and the problem is unsolvable.
           
           **The Plan:**
           
           1.  **Move v8:**
               *   `pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v8`
               *   `place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #t_place_v8`, where *#o2 = (-0.09 0.0 0.781 0.0)*
           
           2.  **Move v12:**
               *   `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v12`
               *   `place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #t_place_v12`, where *#o2 = (-0.001 0.0 0.781 0.0)*
           
           3.  **Move v14:**
               *   `pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v14`
               *   `place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #t_place_v14`,

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v8) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #t_place_v8) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v12) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #t_place_v12) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v14) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #t_place_v14)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, here's the situation. The user gave me a list of valid actions, and my initial plan, which involved `pick` and `place` operations, is a no-go. The only permitted action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This clearly limits my options significantly.
           
           Now, let's look at the goal: I need to get objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto surface `v16`. Simple enough to state, but...
           
           Checking the initial state reveals the problem. Currently, these objects are supported by surface `v11`, not `v16`. Since I can only use `move_base`, this basically means I can move the robot around, but I cannot manipulate the objects themselves. `move_base` changes the robot's pose but doesn't touch the positions of the objects. It's only about the base configuration and the `canmove()` predicate. I'd need to `pick` and `place` those objects, and those actions are off-limits.
           
           So, here's the bottom line:  given the constraints and the limited action space, I *cannot* move these objects from `v11` to `v16`. The goal is unreachable.  I need a different approach entirely.
