(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Achieving `Atom new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, so the task at hand is to satisfy the condition defined by `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a specific type on a designated receptacle.  Let's break this down. The definition stipulates that a green object must be *both* of type `v17` and located "on" receptacle `v18`. I've already determined, through initial state analysis, that we have two contenders for this task: objects `v8` and `v12`, both of type `v17`.
           
           My strategy hinges on understanding the "on" relationship. The `on(?o: object, ?r: object)` axiom gives us the blueprint: it's true when something is both supported and positioned at a specific location.  I've checked the initial state and found that both `v8` is on `v11` and `v12` is on `v14`. Importantly, though, both `v8` and `v12` can be supported on `v18`. To satisfy the main goal, I must set the stage to move either `v8` or `v12` onto `v18`.
           
           Analyzing the available actions, I'll need to use a `pick` and a `place` action. I looked into the current state of both `v8` and `v12`. Because both objects can be placed on `v18` with all the preconditions satisfied, I will choose to move `v8`. The precondition for place is for the base to be at a particular location. This will require an initial action to move the base.
           
           Therefore, the planned solution consists of three key steps:
           
           1. **Base Movement:** First I'll execute a `move_base` action to relocate the robot base, enabling the correct positioning for the `pick` and `place` actions that follow.
           2. **Pick `v8`:** The arm must pick `v8` from its initial pose. This involves finding a valid grasping pose and base conf at which we will pick up the object. This will use a `pick` action to move `v8`.
           3. **Place `v8` on `v18`:** Finally, I'll place the object on the target. This will take the same base position as pick, and placing the object is the action needed to satisfy the goal predicate.
           
           After placing `v8`, I'll confirm I've met the goal condition, by confirming the correct object type predicate, and verifying the `on` predicate.
           
           With this strategic plan, it seems that I can succeed with my final goal.
