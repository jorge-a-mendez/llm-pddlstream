           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable with Available Actions**
           
           My objective is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to placing an object of a certain type (`v17`) onto `v18`. I've analyzed the initial state and determined that either `v8` or `v12` could fulfill this type requirement. Currently, `v8` is on `v11` and `v12` is on `v14`. To get either of them onto `v18`, I would need to manipulate their poses, specifically by using a `pick` and `place` sequence. However, I'm facing a crucial constraint: the problem statement only permits the use of a single action, `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action simply moves the robot's base to the same location and does not affect the positions of any objects.  Since I'm restricted to only using this single action, and I can't reposition `v8` or `v12` onto `v18`, the goal is not achievable under the given constraints.
