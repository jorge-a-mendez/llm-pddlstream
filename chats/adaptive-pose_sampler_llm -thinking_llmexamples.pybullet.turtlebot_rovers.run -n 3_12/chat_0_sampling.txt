User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Strategy for Robot Base Position Generation**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to generate the 25 robot base positions, given the constraints. First, the environment: the robot needs to operate within a rectangular area (x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5]) but can only be up to 4 units away from the target point. This distance, along with the fixed obstacles defined as AABBs, will be the key to our strategy. It's a tricky dance to find diversity while avoiding those nasty collisions and ensuring a clear shot to the target.
           
           The target is at (1.98, -0.66). That’s in the right half of the room. The biggest problem is the vertical wall at x=0. The robot absolutely *cannot* be behind that wall. So, all valid positions must have an x-coordinate greater than 0.05. This single constraint shapes our entire approach. The other obstacles are smaller, rectangular objects scattered around. I'll need to watch out for them during the collision check.
           
           My approach is this: I'll start by focusing on generating points in a circular pattern around the target point, varying the radius and angle, with a strong preference to generate positions to the *left* and *above* the target. This ensures the robot isn't too close to the right wall and can get a view over the surrounding obstacles. I want the angles to sweep from about 60 degrees (top-right) to 300 degrees (bottom-right) to avoid positions to the right of the target.
           
           I'll then implement a collision check: points that land inside any of those fixed obstacles, or violate the region constraint, are discarded. Since I just need the base position, and not the full robot geometry, I’m treating the robot as a point mass. I will use the function `is_point_colliding` to check the point's coordinates against all of the defined AABBs. My target is an efficient method of generating a diverse number of base locations.
           
           I'll iterate and generate candidate positions. With a radius from 1.0 to 3.9 and an angle ranging from 45 to 315 degrees and a denser step size from 0.05 around the original target to create diverse and valid point locations. The code will generate candidates, filter out the collisions, and, if needed, use a grid to fill in any empty slots with valid base locations, within the radius, and using a tighter grid spacing around the target.
