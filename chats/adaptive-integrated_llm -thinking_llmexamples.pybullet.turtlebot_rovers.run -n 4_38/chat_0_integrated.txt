           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **A Plan to Nowhere: The Unreachable Goal**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate goal is `new-axiom@0()`, but it boils down to achieving two things: getting images of some objectives (`receivedimage`) and analyzing some rocks and soil (`receivedanalysis`). Easy enough, right? Not quite.
           
           Initially, I see the conditions that are already true.  The rovers are in place, the camera is online, the mode is set, and the store is free. The problem lies with what's *not* in the initial state. I need to achieve the `receivedimage` predicates for objectives and `receivedanalysis` predicates for rock and soil types.
           
           The action to get an image is a sequence. First calibrate the camera, then take the image, then send the image. For analysis it is send an analysis request, and then sample the rock.
           
           The problem lies with movement. I'm starting with rovers `v12` and `v14` at configurations `v13` and `v15` respectively. They are not at the configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`. The initial state lists `imagevisible` predicates that use config `#o3` and `comvisible` predicates that use config `#o0`.  Also `above` facts use `#o5`. The catch? The *only* moves available are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`. Basically, they can't actually move.
           
           My interpretation of the instructions is that these `#o` variables are continuous parameters, meaning I'd *need* to define a value for them to achieve image and communication. This can be only a configuration `#o0`, or `#o3` and `#o5`. However, since they can't move, they can't get to those configurations. And since none of those configurations are available to them, those actions will never be met.
           
           The initial state says any fact that isn't stated is false. That means the conditions to achieve the goal are impossible to reach.
           With the rovers stuck in place, the plan collapses. I can't calibrate, I can't take images, I can't send them, I can't sample, and I can't analyze. The goal is, unfortunately, unreachable. It seems the environment design limits the rovers to stay put. This means the goal cannot be achieved.
