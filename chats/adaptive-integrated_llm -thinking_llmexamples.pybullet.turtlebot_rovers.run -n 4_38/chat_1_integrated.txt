           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Plan to Achieve new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunction of various conditions, and my job is to create a plan to satisfy them.  I'm starting with a set of established facts in the initial state. The key challenge lies in achieving `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` for specific objects.
           
           My initial assessment of the situation shows that I need to capture images of four objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) using `v14` (a rover equipped with a camera) and a communications mode (v11), then analyze two rock samples. The initial state gives me a head start on some conditions, like the rovers being in place. The main task is managing their movements and actions.
           
           Here's my calculated approach:
           
           1.  **Preparation and Imaging:**  First, I'll move `v14` from its starting point (`v15`) to a configuration `#o3`.  I know `#o3` is a viable position for the initial state because of the existing `imagevisible` predicates. I also need to make sure that the location is free of obstacles, and I will place `o3` at (0.0, 0.0, 0.0), a convenient starting point. Once there, I will use `v10` (the camera) to calibrate and capture images of all the objectives. After taking the images, the calibration state is false. This can easily be fixed through a recalibration before each picture. I'll need to remember to recalibrate.
           
           2.  **Communication:** Next, I'll move `v14` from `#o3` to the communication position, `#o0`. And I'll set its coordinate as (-0.5, -0.5, 0.0). Then I'll transmit those images to the lander (`v9`).
           
           3.  **Sampling and Analysis:** Now, I'll move `v14` from `#o0` to a sampling configuration `#o5`, at (0.0, -0.5, 0.0), and analyze one stone (v1) and one soil sample (v5), because their type conditions are also true in initial state. I will then send the analyses to the lander using the same communication point and finally the rover needs to be set to its intial state (`v15`).
           
           To sum up, here's my plan to accomplish the goal:
           *   Move to capture images.
           *   Calibrate and capture images.
           *   Move to send images.
           *   Move to sample rocks.
           *   Send analysis.
           *   Set robot back to initial state.
           All these steps will be executed in a precise order to ensure that the initial constraints are maintained and the goal condition is met. I am confident that this plan will satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`.

I know `#o3` is a viable position for the initial state because of the existing `imagevisible` predicates. I also need to make sure that the location is free of obstacles, and I will place `o3` at (0.0, 0.0, 0.0), a convenient starting point. Once there, I will use `v10` (the camera) to calibrate and capture images of all the objectives. After taking the images, the calibration state is false. This can easily be fixed through a recalibration before each picture. I'll need to remember to recalibrate.
           
           2.  **Communication:** Next, I'll move `v14` from `#o3` to the communication position, `#o0`. And I'll set its coordinate as (-0.5, -0.5, 0.0). Then I'll transmit those images to the lander (`v9`).
           
           3.  **Sampling and Analysis:** Now, I'll move `v14` from `#o0` to a sampling configuration `#o5`, at (0.0, -0.5, 0.0), and analyze one stone (v1) and one soil sample (v5), because their type conditions are also true in initial state. I will then send the analyses to the lander using the same communication point and finally the rover needs to be set to its intial state (`v15`).
           
           To sum up, here's my plan to accomplish the goal:
           *   Move to capture images.
           *   Calibrate and capture images.
           *   Move to send images.
           *   Move to sample rocks.
           *   Send analysis.
           *   Set robot back to initial state.
           All these steps will be executed in a precise order to ensure that the initial constraints are maintained and the goal condition is met. I am confident that this plan will satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`.
           

User:      Configuration #o3 = (0.0 0.0) for rover v14 at target v17 is in collision with the following fixed obstacles:

(Thoughts: **Refined Plan for a Complex Scenario**
           
           Okay, here's the deal: I've got to revise this plan based on some feedback I received. Basically, the initial idea of using a single configuration for the rover for everything just isn't going to cut it, at least not in the way I originally thought.
           
           The big issue is this: I need to avoid a collision with this annoying vertical obstacle, 'v21', which sits right in the path. The rover can't occupy that space (x between -0.05 and 0.05). Plus, I've got to make sure I can reach my destination (lander) at the beginning, the starting location (v15), the image and sampling targets, and lander for all comvisible actions. So, it's a tight squeeze, making planning and motion an important challenge.
           
           Here's the new strategy: instead of assuming one specific spot will work for all images, I'm now interpreting the feedback as meaning I need different 'configurations' (defined by their x and y coordinates) for the rover for *each* object it's interacting with. So, even though the PDDL code might say `#o3` over and over, that same symbol means different things depending on the context.
           
           For my 'take_image' actions, I'm going to define four different '#o3' configurations: `#o3_17`, `#o3_18`, `#o3_19`, and `#o3_20`, each one for a specific object (v17, v18, v19, v20). This means the rover will move to these individual spots to image them. I'm going to need to make these moves sequential in the plan to get all the data. I'll need to double check the reachability of each target to make sure each step in the plan can work.
           
           In a similar way, I have a single `#o0` symbol. However, it looks like I need a different '#o0' to enable the communication with the Lander v9. Also, since I didn't need any coordinate value for sampling location `#o5`, I'll use it in my code as an implicit state, which I will not define any values for.
           
           This revised approach will get the job done by allowing more precise and collision-avoidant motion of the rover. It seems it requires a bit more effort in terms of individual 'move' actions, but this helps guarantee the plan's feasibility. The main challenge then is to construct a plan that minimizes the amount of travel.

(Thoughts: **Rover V14 Configuration and Task Analysis**
           
           Okay, here's the deal. I've been given some new feedback, and it's making me re-evaluate everything. Turns out the previous configurations I picked for this rover, `v14`, and its communication tasks weren't cutting it. Specifically, those `#o3` imaging setups? Not reachable, apparently. And that `#o0` communication setup? Colliding with the lander itself – weird!
           
           So, I'm going back to the drawing board. Let's look at `v14` and its starting point, `v15` which is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. I've got a wall-like obstacle, `v21`, positioned right down the middle, separating the world at `x = 0`. This is important, as any coordinate with an `x` value of `-0.05` to `0.05` will collide with `v21`.
           
           **Reachability Conundrum:**
           
           The problem states that any setup must be "reachable from the rover's current configuration". That "not reachable for robot base" warning keeps popping up. Is there an issue with the rover's trajectory, the rover's overall movement range or is the objective's position on the map simply inaccessible? Initially, it was believed that `v14` could move to `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` from `v15` based on some initial state, but that must be re-analyzed now. 
           
           **Re-evaluating Objectives:**
           
           Now, I'm re-evaluating the objectives of these rover configurations. We are looking at taking images of some high up targets as well as communicating and rock sampling. The key is now to split tasks where `v14` can access and reach these objectives, since the previous configurations are incorrect. 
           
           I see the map as divided into regions: `x < 0` and `x > 0`. `v14` is located at `x = -1`, so it is on the left side, and `v12` starts at `x = 1`, and it's on the right side.
           
           Based on the targets and rover's location, I'm making sure that the coordinates picked for each setup are reachable and avoiding that `x=0` wall.
           
           To summarize, for each objective, I will be setting up configurations where a camera with type `v10` can achieve the image and objective requirements for `v14`. I believe I can achieve a solution by:
           
           *   **Move to Imaging Locations:**
               I'll ensure `v14` moves to a position for each target (e.g., `v17`, `v19`) where it is in a position to perform a high-quality image. These locations will be near the starting point of the rover (`(-1.0, -1.75)`) as I've found that locations that are too distant in Y are not reachable. 
           
           *   **Communicating with Lander**:
               I must set up a communication point (`#o0_v14_v9`). By placing it `(-1.5, -1.5)`, it is within range of the Lander, but avoids a collision with it.
           
           *   **Sampling**:
               A general point `(-0.8, 0)` is reachable.
           
           *   **Image Transfer**:
               Because it appears to be impossible for a rover to perform tasks across `x=0`, and the initial state implies that the goal is achievable, both the image transfer and rock sampling need to be achieved by the tasks performed by `v14`.

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Plan Refinement: Navigating the Reachability Conundrum**
           
           My initial plan failed due to invalid actions using specific configurations. I understand now that I need to use the generic configurations `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5` in the actions, with the specific values defined in the `--Configurations--` section. The most significant challenge is the "not reachable for robot base" error, particularly with imaging targets located at higher y-coordinates. I am an expert in solving such constraint satisfaction problems, but I must now apply my expertise to reconcile the problem constraints.
           
           The problem states that the rover *must* have a valid configuration `#o3` for all `imagevisible` predicates, meaning that the motion is *possible*. The initial rover y-position is around `-1.75`. My task is to find a set of coordinates for the rover (`#o3`) that satisfies the reachability conditions *and* allows a successful plan execution.
           
           Given the nature of the problem, I must use my knowledge of the constraints to determine feasible paths for the rover. I believe there is a direct correlation with the y coordinates and the 'reachability' constraint. I have spent time testing various values that may be acceptable to the system to overcome these rejections.
           
           I've revised the plan structure for clarity, defining a specific sequence of actions to reach the specified goal, utilizing my understanding of the valid motion actions and predicates. It is likely that the "not reachable" errors are caused by either an incorrectly specified coordinate or a constraint I am not considering. I have accounted for this by attempting to keep `y` values close to the rover's initial starting location and to stay within a 2-unit range.
           
           After further analysis of the initial problem state, I am convinced that the root of the problem is the rover's ability to "look up." My interpretation of the rules should allow a rover to have access to each required node.
           
           I have decided to pursue these coordinates for `#o3`:
           
           *   For `v17`: `(-1.1, 1.2)` (within 2 units)
           *   For `v18`: `(1.1, 1.2)` (within 2 units)
           *   For `v19`: `(-0.6, 1.3)` (within 2 units)
           *   For `v20`: `(0.5, 0.6)` (within 2 units)
           
           I believe this approach will work, and I will now generate the plan based on these coordinates.
           
           I am confident that the current approach with these refined values will provide successful results.
