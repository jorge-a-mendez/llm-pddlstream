User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object

           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v19: object

           v5: object
           v6: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.196, 0.513)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.782, -0.165), (-4.7, -0.083)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.741, -0.124, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.772, 0.635).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Planning for Achieving the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with devising a plan to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to placing `v12` on `v18` and confirming its type.  I can quickly see that `type(v12, v17)` is already true in the initial state, so I need to focus on getting `on(v12, v18)` to be true. From the problem definition, I know that for `on(v12, v18)` to be true, I need two things: `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)`. Fortunately, `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` is given in the initial state. This means all I need to do is arrange for `atpose(v12, #o2)`.
           
           Currently, `v12` is at `v13`. I see two actions that seem promising: `pick` and `place`. The preconditions for `pick` are satisfied as the arm is currently empty and `atpose(v12, v13)` is true. I also have the `kin` facts and, importantly, no explicit collision risks are stated.  This implicitly suggests that `unsafe` predicates are false, allowing a pick. After the pick, I'll need to place. The `place` action requires `atgrasp` (which is the result of the `pick` operation) and `kin` to be true.  I also need to ensure there are no collisions.  I will have to make sure that the `place` action doesn't create any unsafe scenarios. My current belief is `#o3` is the initial and final base configuration. If this is true, I can immediately pick and place.
           
           Looking at the world, I can see that `v12` starts on `v14` on the left of the scene and `v15` is on the right side of the robot on surface `v11`. I also have another object `v20`. The goal surface, `v18`, is also on the right side and partly overlapping `v11`. I need to choose a free position on the right side of the scene, namely `v18` to place the object and keep it as safe as possible.
           I've decided on a pose for `v12` at `#o2`:  (4.5, -0.3, 0.8), as it's within `v18`'s bounds and far from `v15` and `v20` to avoid conflicts.
           
           So the plan: `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4` followed by `place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`. The base does not need to move. This looks like a simple but reliable solution. No collision issues are found. The minimal cost is two. And I believe that will achieve the goal.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', #o3) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Understanding the Planning Failure**
           
           Okay, so the previous plan failed, and the user points out that `atbconf(#o3)` wasn't satisfied.  Let's break this down from a planning perspective.  Initially, I thought `#o3` was the target base configuration, but the initial state doesn't *explicitly* state that `atbconf(#o3)`.  It does mention `bconf(#o3)` which means `#o3` is *a* base configuration, but not necessarily the *current* one.
           
           Looking at the actions, the only way to establish `atbconf` is through `move_base`.  The preconditions for `move_base` are `basemotion(?q1, ?t, ?q2)`, `atbconf(?q1)`, and `canmove()`. We *have* `basemotion(#o3, #o0, #o3)` and `canmove()`.  However, we *don't* have `atbconf(?q1)` for *any* `?q1`.  This is a critical flaw!
           
           Without `atbconf(?q)` being true for any base configuration, `move_base` cannot be executed, and therefore, neither can `pick` or `place` which also require `atbconf(?q)`.  Essentially, the robot is stuck.
           
           Re-examining the entire initial state confirms this.  We have information about the robot's arm, graspable objects, poses, support structures, and the base motion.  We also have `bconf(#o3)` and a whole lot of `kin` facts, but no `atbconf(?)`.  The problem boils down to this: the robot is *not* currently at a known base configuration.
           
           Therefore, given this initial state, the robot is simply unable to perform any actions that require it to be at a base configuration, including moving, picking, or placing.  The plan is fundamentally unreachable.
