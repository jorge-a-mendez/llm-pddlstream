           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **My strategy for finding 50 stable placements of Object 4 on Surface 0 has come together quite neatly.** My field expertise tells me that because the object is a square, its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) remains a square regardless of rotation.  The initial problem is straightforward. I need the object to be entirely within the surface boundaries, meaning the object's AABB cannot extend beyond the AABB of the surface.  Since the object's dimensions are known, the critical thing is rotation.
           
           I know that the object's smallest effective bounding box is its original size, and the largest occurs at a 45-degree angle.  I can express the effective side length of the bounding box as a function of the rotation angle. Using this, I can derive the valid range for the center of the object for any rotation;  the center of the object can move within the surface if its effective bounding box remains within the surface's boundaries.  The equation for this range is: `-(Surface_width/2 - Effective_width/2) <= x <= (Surface_width/2 - Effective_width/2)` for both x and y.
           
           To achieve diversity in placements, I determined to test several rotation angles (`theta`) over the domain [0, pi], as angles over pi are redundant for a square.  For each angle, I calculated the effective bounding box and then the corresponding valid range for the center of the object.  Then, I would populate points from within the given range with a few samples in each direction.
           
           I generated 50 placements. To achieve this, I used ten rotations and five (x, y) coordinates for each: 1 at the center, then four more on the principal axes for that rotation angle.
           
           In a nutshell:
           
           1.  **Calculate Effective Side Length:** Calculate the effective side length of the square's AABB for different angles.
           2.  **Determine Valid Center Range:** Compute the x and y ranges for the object's center based on the effective side length, ensuring the AABB stays within Surface 0.
           3.  **Create Placements:**  Generate placements (surf_idx, theta, x, y) for 50 coordinates, spread across different rotations using a few x,y coordinates per rotation.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Placing Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed object 4, a small square, at the center of surface 0. Now, I need to figure out where to put object 5, another square, on the same surface. The main challenge is avoiding collision with object 4, which is already taking up space.
           
           I'm starting by analyzing the situation. Object 4 is at the origin, and I've calculated its bounding box. Object 5 is almost the same size, but not quite. The surface bounds are also provided. I'm going to follow my usual strategy: I'll iterate through different rotations (theta) for object 5. For each rotation, I'll figure out the *effective* size of the object, which changes with the angle.  Based on the surface boundaries and the effective size, I'll determine the valid range for the center of object 5.
           
           This is a pretty standard approach, but this time I need to incorporate the collision check. I will use the familiar AABB collision detection. If two bounding boxes overlap, it's a collision. I will calculate the AABB of object 5 based on its potential center and rotation. I already calculated the AABB of object 4. I will then use that information.
           
           Here's the problem: Object 4 is *in the center* of the surface. And the two squares are almost the same size. If I'm thinking correctly, it's going to be impossible to place object 5 without at least some *small* overlap and collision. I can start by analyzing the case with theta=0. Since the two objects are very close in size, and Object 4 is at the center, I need to make sure that Object 5 doesn't overlap object 4's bounding box. 
           If Object 4, at the origin, has AABB `[-a, a] x [-a, a]`, then if object 5's center is also at (0,0), then the collision is certain. If the *entire* rectangle for the object is contained in the square (i.e. object 5), the center of object 5 cannot be placed anywhere because it requires some overlap. For placement, the center of the object must be outside some specific area for collision to not happen. This makes sense.
           
           After doing some calculations, it looks like, indeed, *no* stable placement exists for object 5 that fully contained within the surface, and outside Object 4. In other words, because the object sizes are very close. With theta = 0, there is no place to put the center of Object 5 without colliding with Object 4, which is in the center.
           
           It looks like the condition I need is `S4_half + S5_half_eff <= D` Where S4_half is half the size of object 4, D is half the surface side, and S5_half_eff is the half of the effective size. This means the two objects can fit within the total available space.
           
           I'm confident this is the situation, given Object 4's location. Since the prompt states that I must return 50 placements, I must do that, even if I know they will collide. I'm going to generate the placements while showing my work. The most "reasonable" set of placements, given the lack of valid ones, would be to make use of the surface boundaries only, ignoring Object 4. These placements will be clearly invalid. I need to make the point explicit.

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning for Object 8 Placement**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new request for Object ID 8. My initial thought is to analyze the constraints and figure out a valid placement. The surface is straightforward: a simple square. However, I need to account for the two previously "successfully" placed objects, IDs 4 and 5, which are both at (0,0) with theta = 0. This is where things get tricky because the problem states I need to avoid collision with these previously placed objects.
           
           The system's behavior regarding multiple objects "succeeding" at the same location is what I need to understand. If they are overlapping, or if the "last success" should be the only one that counts. Because if I treat the combined occupied space of objects 4 and 5 as *occupied space* (which is the most logical), there's no way to place Object 8 without overlap. Object 8 has dimensions that are bigger than either of the objects at (0,0). I then calculated the minimal boundary where the object's center has to avoid so that it *doesn't* collide, and this zone is outside of the surface's boundary.
           
           The problem specifically says to avoid collision with previously placed objects. This implies that I need to avoid the entire AABB occupied by the previous objects, at the same time I need to fit the new object *into* the provided surface. It's an impossible situation. I am forced to conclude that any attempt to place Object 8 will result in a collision, given the current setup. I'm assuming it's an intentional setup from the system, and that I'm supposed to try even when collisions are bound to occur. Given this, I will try to place Object 8 to comply with the instructions given in the prompt, despite my understanding that the placements will be non-viable and overlap.
           
           As directed, I will generate placements *within the surface boundaries only* and explicitly note that these placements will collide with previously placed objects. I will then use this knowledge and the previous strategies to try to generate the new placements.

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my plan to place Object 7 on Surface 0, avoiding collisions and maintaining stability:**
           
           I've got a new request!  I need to find 50 stable locations for Object ID 7 on Surface 0, while also steering clear of three existing objects: IDs 4, 5, and 8.
           
           **First, the Scene:**
           
           *   Surface 0 is a square, centered at (0,0), with dimensions of 0.270 x 0.270.  My challenge is to keep Object 7 within this space.
           *   Object 7 is a square with side size 0.07212221533797655.
           
           **Pre-Existing Obstacles:**
           
           *   Objects 4, 5, and 8 are already in place, all at (0,0). I need to avoid bumping into them.
           *   These objects form a composite obstacle at the center of the surface, with a combined radius of 0.049466901869920645. Essentially, I need to stay outside a circular zone of this radius.
           
           **The Stability Rule:**
           
           For stable placement, the object must avoid collisions AND remain on the surface.
           
           **Collision Avoidance is Key:**
           
           I've determined a strategy based on rotation, with the goal of finding places to position Object 7 on the surface. For an object with side length `S7`, its effective radius is dependent on its orientation. This makes it impossible to place the object outside the bounds without colliding. Because the other object sizes are the same, my calculations showed that I need to place the object near the "corners" of the available space. I also know that I have to work around previously placed objects, I have calculated these "safe" bounds on the surface to ensure that there are no collisions.
           
           I'll generate placements near the corners to avoid collision or be forced to place with the knowledge that it will collide.
           
           I'll use some coordinate calculations to place 50 objects in total:
           - 25 placed at 0 degrees.
           - 25 placed at 90 degrees.
           
           This placement will maximize object placements.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object 6**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. I've got a square object (Object 6) that needs to find 50 stable placements on a surface, dodging several fixed obstacles already in place. The surface is a square, and the previous objects are squares as well, positioned with no rotation. This makes things easier.
           
           First, I need to understand the "no-go" zones created by the existing obstacles. I'll do this by:
           
           1.  **AABB Calculations:** For each existing object, I calculate its Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) given the successful placement data (position and size).
           2.  **Occupied Region Union:** I'll combine these AABBs into a single, comprehensive "occupied region". This region represents the total area already taken up.
           
           Object 6 has a side of `0.073`.
           
           Then, I'll calculate the AABB of Object 6 for each position to assess collision:
           
           1.  **Constraints**: Object 6's center must be within the square surface bounds. The maximum displacement from the surface center is surface-half_side minus half of Object 6's effective size.
           2.  **Collision Avoidance**:  I must ensure Object 6's AABB doesn't overlap any of the existing obstacle AABBs, and I'll keep testing and re-calculating the AABB (rotation angle).
           
           Since all successful placements have a rotation of 0, I can assume the obstacle bounding boxes are also aligned with the axes. This simplifies collision checking, avoiding the need to perform intersection tests for arbitrarily rotated boxes.
           
           **Finding Safe Zones:**
           I'll begin by analyzing `theta=0`.
           I've calculated the size, and constraints for a placement. I know that since the previous obstacles are roughly centered and in some horizontal bands, the largest area free for Object 6 is around y = -0.09.
           
           I need to come up with `50` placements, and the best way will be to have some with angle zero, some with angle 90 degrees.
           *   **Bottom Strip:** I identified a large free area at the bottom of the surface.
               Object 6 can be anywhere in this strip.
           
           *   **Top-Left and Top-Right Corners:** I identified two corridors in the top corners for the object.
           
           I'll use some placements at `theta=0`, for bottom strip, and a few placements at `theta=90` to round out the 50 total.
