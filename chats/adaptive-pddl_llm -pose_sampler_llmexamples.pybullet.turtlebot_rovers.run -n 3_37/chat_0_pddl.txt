User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is enclosed by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a central vertical wall at x = 0. There are also several smaller rectangular obstacles scattered throughout the environment.
           
           Given the target point, I will try to find positions on a circle of radius 1.5 around the target point, as this allows for some distance from the target while still being well within the max range. I will try to pick points that are not directly aligned with the central vertical wall (x=0) or any obvious small obstacles.
