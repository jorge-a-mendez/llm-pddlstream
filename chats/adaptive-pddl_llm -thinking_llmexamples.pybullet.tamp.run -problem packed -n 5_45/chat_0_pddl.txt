           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Impasse: The Impossibility of the Goal**
           
           Okay, so the objective is clear: get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` onto object `v20`. This necessitates using the `on` predicate, which, as we know, hinges on `supported` and `atpose`.  My mental model is now focused on finding poses `p` for each of these objects such that they are both `supported` by `v20` and `atpose` at that pose.
           
           I quickly scan the initial state.  The objects are currently at poses `v9`, `v13`, `v15`, `v17`, and `v19` respectively, and they're all supported by `v11`.  This sets the stage – they're currently *not* on `v20`.
           
           The only path to achieving this requires manipulating the poses of these objects.  I instinctively reach for my tools: `pick` and `place`. But wait... the provided constraints... any action not explicitly listed is off-limits. I analyze the list and see only one action instance allowed: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This is a robot base movement action, which *cannot* directly influence the `atpose` or `supported` relations. It's a non-starter.
           
           The problem explicitly states that I'm confined to the given actions.  Since `pick` and `place` are the only means to modify `atpose` and thus establish the `on` relation, the goal is, unfortunately, unreachable. I confirm that even if I execute the allowed `move_base` action, it has no meaningful impact on achieving the final state, and it introduces a state change to the robot state. This situation presents a fundamental contradiction: the objective requires actions I am not permitted to use. The current allowed actions simply will not work.
