           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable due to Configuration Constraints**
           
           My task is to devise a plan to satisfy the conditions of `new-axiom@0()`, which necessitates achieving sub-goals related to image reception and analysis.  After careful examination of the problem and its constraints, I've concluded that the goal is unattainable given the provided action instances.
           
           Specifically, the sub-goals are: receive images from two objectives, `v17` and `v18`; send analysis of a rock of type `v2` and a soil sample of type `v6`.  To fulfill the image goals, I need rovers to *take* images and subsequently *send* them to the lander.  To satisfy the analysis requirements, I need to have the rovers *sample* the identified rock and soil, and then *send* the resulting analyses.  This will require `move`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions.  However, the *specific instances* of those actions that I am allowed to use create a critical impediment.
           
           The key issue hinges on the precondition `atconf(?v, ?q)` required by each action that alters the rovers' states.  This predicate demands that the rover be "at" a specific *configuration* before that action can be taken. The current configurations are defined as `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`.  The problem details state that, to achieve my sub-goals, I must place those configurations where the rovers can see the given objectives and communicate with the lander. But the *only* `move` actions I'm allowed to use are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`.  These do not change the rover's location; they are self-loops.
           
           Because the only `move` actions available do not let the rover move from its starting configuration, and because the actions to achieve our subgoals *require* the rover to be at specific configurations, I am unable to construct a valid plan.  There are no action instances available to modify the current configurations of `v12` or `v14` to enable `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`.  As such, I cannot achieve the stated goal.
