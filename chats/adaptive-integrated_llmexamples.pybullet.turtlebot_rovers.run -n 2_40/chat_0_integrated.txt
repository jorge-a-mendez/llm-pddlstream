           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, two landers, v9, and several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8). There's also a camera, v10, which can support different modes (v11) and is onboard both rovers. Two objectives (v17, v18) are present. Both rovers have a store (v16) which is currently free.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are true (which they are initially).
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true (which they are initially).
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)` are true.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` are true.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` are true.
           
           From the available action instances, we can see that no `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` actions are directly provided, only `move` and `drop_rock`. Since `drop_rock` requires `full(rover, store)` to be true, and both stores are `free`, this action is not immediately useful. The `move` actions simply move the rovers to their current configurations, which doesn't change their state meaningfully.
           
           Given the initial state and the limited set of executable actions, it's impossible to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()` because:
           - We cannot take images (no `take_image` actions).
           - We cannot send images (no `send_image` actions).
           - We cannot sample rocks (no `sample_rock` actions).
           - We cannot send analyses (no `send_analysis` actions).
           
           Therefore, we cannot satisfy the conditions `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           The goal is unreachable with the given set of allowed actions.
