User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point.

           Okay, here's the deal. I've got a target point at `(2.13, 0.5)` and I need to find three suitable locations for a robot base. The robot needs to be within a `max_range = 2` of the target, and its orientation (`theta`) will automatically adjust to face the target. Crucially, I need to avoid any collisions with fixed obstacles and ensure a clear line of sight to the target from each chosen position.  The environment boundaries are defined as [-2.5, 2.5] for both x and y.
           
           I've been given a list of obstacles, defined as AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes). I've analyzed these to get a sense of the layout. The main thing to note is a central wall at `x = 0`, which is going to be a key consideration. Any robot position on the left side of this wall will have its line of sight blocked. So, I need to be at `x > 0.05` to be sure.
           
           The actual valid search space for the robot base is a circle around the target with a radius of 2.  The target is located in the upper-right quadrant of the room. I determined the valid range for `x` as `[0.13, 2.5]` and for `y` as `[-1.5, 2.5]`.
           
           I've got a list of obstacles, some of which are very small and positioned near the target and these are going to be key for checking collision and occlusion.
           
           My strategy is to generate candidate points within the valid search area, filter based on the constraints (room limits, central wall), and then rigorously check for collisions with obstacles and any line-of-sight obstructions.
           
           After a few trials, my first position is `(2.5, 0.5)`: directly right of the target. Then `(1.8, -1.4)`: below and slightly left of the target, and finally `(2.5, 2.0)`: above and right. These three positions all respect the spatial constraints.
