           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment: Impossibility of Achieving the Goal**
           
           Okay, here's the situation as I see it. My primary objective is to get objects v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18 all *on* object v20.  I'm dealing with predicates like `on`, `atpose`, and `supported`.  Based on the initial state, all these target objects are currently *on* v11, supported by it.
           
           My first thought was to assess what actions are at my disposal. Unfortunately, the only action I have available is `move_base`. This action alters the robot's base configuration – essentially its position – but it has zero impact on the `on` predicate, which is precisely what I need to change.
           
           Next, I reviewed the axioms defining the relationships. To establish `on(object, target)`, I need a `supported` predicate and an `atpose` predicate for that object. For instance, to have `on(v8, v20)`, I would need `supported(v8, ?pose, v20)` and `atpose(v8, ?pose)`.
           
           I then analyzed the available poses and supporting objects. I saw that `v8` could be supported by v20, but the current pose (where v8 is supported by v11) is holding me back.  The same is true for all of the other objects I need to move. I can see the possible end state from a support perspective (the `supported` predicate), but I can't *move* the objects into the right pose.
           
           The critical issue is the lack of `pick` and `place` actions.  These are the actions I *need* to manipulate objects and change their positions and poses to meet the 'on' criteria.  Without `pick` and `place`, I can't change any of the `atpose` predicates, and consequently, I can't establish the desired `on` predicates.
           
           Therefore, given the available actions, the goal is unequivocally unattainable. I can't move the necessary objects to v20. It's simply not possible with the constraints I'm facing.
