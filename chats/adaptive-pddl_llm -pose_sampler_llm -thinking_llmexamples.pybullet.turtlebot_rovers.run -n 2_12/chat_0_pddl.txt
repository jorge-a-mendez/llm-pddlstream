User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Robot Base Placement Strategy for Target Point Visibility**
           
           My task is to identify three viable (x, y) positions for a robot's base, given a specific target point.  The robot must be within a maximum range of 2 units from the target and confined to a 5x5 square area (x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5]).  The core challenge lies in avoiding collisions with fixed obstacles while ensuring the robot has a clear line of sight to the target. I am provided with the geometry of the obstacles as Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs).
           
           My approach can be broken down into key steps:
           
           1.  **Scene Understanding:** First, I mentally map the environment by analyzing the AABBs.  This initial analysis includes identifying the outer boundary (AABB 0), inner walls (AABBs 1-4, defining the robot's work space), and various smaller obstacles (AABBs 6-20). The robot cannot physically exist *outside* this space, but cannot be *inside* the wall thickness. The key features are the central vertical wall and several smaller ones scattered around the space.
           
           2.  **Strategic Point Generation:** I'll focus on generating candidate robot positions. The robot's orientation is automatically set to face the target. I only need to determine the (x, y) coordinates. The robot must be within a 2-unit radius of the target and remain within the spatial boundaries. The goal is to avoid collisions with fixed obstacles and to try to identify "open" areas for line-of-sight.
           
           3.  **Collision and Line-of-Sight Evaluation:** Since I do not have a full simulation environment, I must perform educated checks. A simple collision-detection check will determine if the robot's candidate position is inside any of the given AABBs. I'll add a small buffer ( `robot_radius=0.1` ) to ensure a margin of safety.  The main challenge is line-of-sight verification. This involves checking that no obstacle blocks a direct line between the robot and the target. As the geometry is not given, I'll prioritize picking positions in open spaces. For the first request, I'll rely on a basic "open space" assumption and consider line-of-sight if a larger obstacle, such as the central wall, is present.
           
           4.  **Handling Feedback:** While I do not have a simulator to determine why a proposed position fails, repeated failure for the same target will likely be due to a collision or line-of-sight issue. This first request focuses on the static, fixed obstacles.
           
           5.  **Position Generation Logic:** I will generate a range of candidate positions around the target at varying distances (0.5 to 2.0 units) and angles (0 to 2π). I'll start from positions furthest from the target and iterate down. The core filter for each candidate is to verify that the coordinate falls inside the environment bounds, is at most `2` from the target, does not collide with the fixed obstacles, and has a clear line-of-sight to the target. I'll continue generating points until three valid locations are identified.
           
           With a mental model and some constraints, the goal is to define valid, non-colliding robot base points.
