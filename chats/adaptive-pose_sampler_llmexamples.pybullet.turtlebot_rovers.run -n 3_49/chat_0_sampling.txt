           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room defined by bounding boxes 0-4. There's a vertical wall in the middle (5). There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the room, including two larger ones in the upper corners (7, 8) and two in the middle-top (9, 10), and one in the bottom-left quadrant (6). There are also several small obstacles, some of which are very small, which I will need to be careful to avoid.
           
           The target point is (-0.1 -1.4). This is in the bottom-left quadrant, close to the central vertical wall (5). It's also near obstacle 18.
           I need to find 3 positions within a radius of 2 from this point.
           Distance from 0,0: sqrt((-0.1)^2 + (-1.4)^2) = sqrt(0.01 + 1.96) = sqrt(1.97) = 1.403. So the target is close to the center of the room.
           
           Considering the target is at (-0.1, -1.4):
           - I should avoid positions that would place the robot inside the large central wall (5) at x=0.
           - I need to be careful about obstacle 18 ((-0.27, -1.35), (-0.13, -1.21)) which is very close to the target.
           - Obstacle 6 ((-2.4, -2.34), (-1.39, -1.65)) is in the bottom-left, so I should avoid getting too close to that area if I move left.
           - Obstacle 12 ((0.66, -1.97), (0.8, -1.83)) is to the right and slightly below the target.
           
           I will try to place positions around the target.
           1. Directly to the right of the target, avoiding the central wall, and making sure not to hit obstacle 12.
           2. Directly below the target, but not too far left to avoid obstacle 6.
           3. Slightly above and to the left of the target, to avoid obstacle 18.
           
           Let's calculate some possible positions:
           Target: (-0.1, -1.4)
           Max distance: 2
           
           Position 1: To the right.
           If I pick (0.5, -1.4), the distance is sqrt((0.5 - (-0.1))^2 + (-1.4 - (-1.4))^2) = sqrt(0.6^2) = 0.6. This is within max_range and avoids the central wall. It's also to the left of obstacle 12.
           
           Position 2: Below.
           If I pick (-0.1, -2.0), the distance is sqrt((-0.1 - (-0.1))^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.4))^2) = sqrt((-0.6)^2) = 0.6. This is within max_range. It also seems to avoid obstacle 6.
           
           Position 3: Above and to the left.
           If I pick (-0.5, -1.0), the distance is sqrt((-0.5 - (-0.1))^2 + (-1.0 - (-1.4))^2) = sqrt((-0.4)^2 + (0.4)^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 0.16) = sqrt(0.32) = 0.56. This avoids obstacle 18 and seems clear of other obstacles.
           
           Positions:
           (0.5 -1.4)
           (-0.1 -2.0)
           (-0.5 -1.0)
           

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The previous target point was different from the current one. The failures were:
           - (0.5, -1.4) was too far from the previous target and had no line of sight.
           - (-0.1, -2.0) collided with the central wall (obstacle 0: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))). This means any x-coordinate between -0.05 and 0.05 will collide with the wall. My previous proposed position (-0.1, -2.0) had x = -0.1, which is outside the collision range, so this might indicate a slightly wider collision geometry or a rounding error in the collision check. I should be more cautious around x=0.
           - (-0.5, -1.0) also had no line of sight to the previous target.
           
           The new target point is (-0.1 -1.4). This is the *same target point* as in the previous request. This means I need to re-evaluate my previous choices based on the new information about collisions and line-of-sight *for this specific target*.
           
           The failures for the *current target point* (-0.1, -1.4) are:
           - (0.5, -1.4) -- no line of sight to target. This is surprising given it's to the right of the target and clear of the central wall. It might be occluded by a small obstacle.
           - (-0.1, -2.0) -- collided with obstacle 0 (central wall). This confirms my earlier concern about positions close to x=0. Even though -0.1 is slightly outside the stated bounds of obstacle 0, it seems to still cause a collision. I should try to keep x values further away from 0.
           - (-0.5, -1.0) -- no line of sight to target. Similar to (0.5, -1.4), this might be an occlusion by a small obstacle.
           
           Since all three previous positions failed, I need to come up with completely new ones.
           The target is at (-0.1, -1.4). I need to avoid x values too close to 0, and also be wary of possible occlusions.
           The robot needs to be within 2 units of (-0.1, -1.4).
           
           Let's rethink my strategy.
           1. Avoid x-coordinates between -0.05 and 0.05 (due to obstacle 0 collision). I should also probably be more cautious and avoid anything closer to x=0.
           2. The previous line-of-sight issues for (0.5, -1.4) and (-0.5, -1.0) are concerning. I need to be more deliberate about finding clear lines of sight.
           3. Obstacle 18 ((-0.27, -1.35), (-0.13, -1.21)) is very close to the target. My previous attempt (-0.5, -1.0) might have been occluded by this or another small object.
           
           Let's try to place positions further away from the central vertical wall and further away from the immediate vicinity of the target where small obstacles might be hiding.
           
           New strategy:
           - Move further to the left to avoid the central wall and obstacle 18, and also consider the bounding box of obstacle 6.
           - Move further to the right, away from the central wall and obstacle 18, and away from obstacle 12.
           - Move further below, but again, away from x=0 and clear of obstacle 6 and obstacle 12.
           
           Target: (-0.1, -1.4)
           
           Position 1: To the left and slightly below.
           Let's try (-1.0, -1.5).
           Distance: sqrt((-1.0 - (-0.1))^2 + (-1.5 - (-1.4))^2) = sqrt((-0.9)^2 + (-0.1)^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 0.01) = sqrt(0.82) = 0.905. This is well within range.
           This x value is far from 0. It is to the right of obstacle 6.
           
           Position 2: To the right and slightly below.
           Let's try (1.0, -1.5).
           Distance: sqrt((1.0 - (-0.1))^2 + (-1.5 - (-1.4))^2) = sqrt((1.1)^2 + (-0.1)^2) = sqrt(1.21 + 0.01) = sqrt(1.22) = 1.10. This is well within range.
           This x value is far from 0. It is to the left of obstacle 12.
           
           Position 3: Directly below and shifted left to avoid x=0.
           Let's try (-0.5, -2.0).
           Distance: sqrt((-0.5 - (-0.1))^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.4))^2) = sqrt((-0.4)^2 + (-0.6)^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 0.36) = sqrt(0.52) = 0.72. This is well within range.
           This position avoids x=0 and is to the right of obstacle 6.
           
           Positions:
           (-1.0 -1.5)
           (1.0 -1.5)
           (-0.5 -2.0)
