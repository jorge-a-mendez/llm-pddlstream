           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks us to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom representing the successful completion of several tasks:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: Both rovers are at their respective initial configurations. These are true in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: Both rovers' storage is free. These are true in the initial state.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Images of objectives v17 and v18 are received at the lander. This means a rover needs to take an image of v17 and v18 with camera v10 in mode v11, and then send it to lander v9.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: A stone (type v2) has been analyzed and the analysis has been received. This means a rover needs to sample a rock of type v2 and send the analysis to the lander.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: Soil (type v6) has been analyzed and the analysis has been received. This means a rover needs to sample a rock of type v6 and send the analysis to the lander.
           
           Let's break down the required actions:
           
           **For `receivedimage(v17, v11)`:**
           *   A rover (v12 or v14) needs to take an image of v17 using camera v10 in mode v11.
               *   Preconditions for `take_image`: `imagevisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o)`, `onboard(?c, ?v)`, `supports(?c, ?m)`, `atconf(?v, ?q)`, `calibrated(?c, ?v)`, `~blocked(?y)`.
               *   Then, the rover needs to send the image.
               *   Preconditions for `send_image`: `comvisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l)`, `objective(?o)`, `mode(?m)`, `haveimage(?v, ?o, ?m)`, `atconf(?v, ?q)`, `~blocked(?y)`.
           
           **For `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:**
           *   Similar to the above, for objective v18.
           
           **For `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`:**
           *   A rover needs to `sample_rock` of type v2 (stone) and then `send_analysis`.
           *   A rover needs to `sample_rock` of type v6 (soil) and then `send_analysis`.
           
           **Available Actions:** The available action instances are limited to `move` and `drop_rock`. This is a crucial constraint.
           The initial state already has `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`, and `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`.
           The goal requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates to be true. However, none of the allowed actions (`move` or `drop_rock`) can directly achieve these goals. The actions `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis` are *not* provided in the list of valid action instances.
           
           Since the goal relies on actions that are not allowed to be used (e.g., `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`), it is impossible to achieve the goal with the given set of allowed actions. The only actions available are `move` and `drop_rock`, neither of which can satisfy the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable.
