User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Finding Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of the task.  I need to find three suitable (x, y) positions for the robot's base, near a target point, avoiding collisions. The robot's orientation will automatically adjust to face the target. I'm given a target point (0.9, -0.6), and a constraint of a maximum range of 2 from the target. The robot's workspace is a 5x5 area centered at (0,0), with some fixed obstacle boxes defined as AABBs, specifically a vertical wall at x=0. The x,y bounds are also given: [-2.5, 2.5] x [-2.5, 2.5].
           
           The target's location strongly influences my approach. Since the target (0.9, -0.6) is to the right of the vertical wall (at x=0), the robot's base also needs to be on the right side. Any position on the left would be either occluded or collide with the wall.  This means x values need to be strictly above 0 to allow line of sight.
           
           **Determining Search Space**
           
           To meet the 2-unit maximum range constraint, the robot's base must fall within a circle of radius 2 centered at the target (0.9, -0.6).  Given the environment constraints, I need to find the intersected region between the circle, the x>0 boundary, and the -2.5-2.5 bounds. This creates a constrained search space where I'm going to look for base positions.
           
           Since the target is to the right of the wall (x = 0), I can assume that the robot base must reside at x > 0.05.
           
           **Candidate Selection Strategy**
           
           My strategy is to choose locations around the target point. This lets me generate a set of positions based on angles and distances around it. I'll test several points: one on the right, above, and below. It should give me the diversity of solutions.
           Specifically, I chose points at a distance of approximately 1.5, to be within the max 2 distance.
           
           **Candidate Evaluation**
           
           Once a candidate position has been chosen, I will check several things:
           *   **Distance:** The position must be at most 2 units away from the target (0.9, -0.6).
           *   **Collision:** It cannot collide with any fixed obstacles, so I will analyze the line segment between the robot and target point to confirm no obstacles obstruct them.
           
           After detailed calculation and verification, I determined that the following three (x, y) positions met the criteria:
           
           1.  (1.766, -0.1)
           2.  (2.4588, -1.5)
           3.  (2.2, -0.6)
           
           These positions give a range of points that can be used by the robot to reach the target location.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing a Challenging Target Point and Leveraging Previous Feedback**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new target: (0.6336359977722168, 1.9552711248397827), which I'll simplify to (0.63, 1.95), and the instruction tells me to provide a valid placement for the robot within 2 units. I’ve received some “negative feedback” from a previous request, but it seems to be for a different target, or perhaps it was given out of order, and should be evaluated against this new target point. The feedback includes a bunch of positions that apparently failed due to collisions or lack of line of sight. Given the context, this suggests the feedback could provide clues.
           
           I will approach this by considering the following constraints: Keep the robot base within [-2.5, 2.5] for both x and y. Ensure the distance between the robot base and the target is at most 2. Consider obstacles to ensure there is line of sight. Given the target point, I must avoid the central wall at x=0. With this information in mind, my initial steps are to check for obstructions and find ways to avoid occlusions. I will analyze obstacle coordinates, looking for positions that avoid known problematic zones.
           
           Firstly, I will use some logic to pick a valid position for the robot. Based on the target point and constraints, I must avoid a central wall at x=0. Furthermore, the target point is in the upper right quadrant. After this, I need to consider nearby obstacles, and known negative feedback points. Given the prompt, there are several nearby boxes around the target that may prove difficult to navigate. I will need to be careful of collision and occlusion.
           
           I’ll make some calculations to ensure I meet the requirements set forth in the instruction prompt. Additionally, I’ve noted the failure points from the provided feedback and intend to leverage them to better understand the landscape. In this regard, it seems prudent to avoid known failed positions based on past interaction.
           
           Because there is a high likelihood of occlusion by a neighboring obstacle (at or nearby target coordinates), I will aim for positions outside of the immediate vicinity.
           
           Based on the surrounding landscape and constraints, the main strategy I choose to approach the target point at (0.63, 1.95) will be to be located *outside* the target's immediate area of the map in one of these ways:  
           1.  **Directly Above:** Robot placement, (0.1, 2.4).
           2.  **To the Right and Low:** Robot Placement, (1.0, 1.0).
           3.  **To the Left and Low:** Robot Placement, (0.15, 0.5)
           
           These placements and their line-of-sight checks will all ensure the constraints are met and I can provide an accurate answer.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Positioning for Target Acquisition**
           
           Okay, let's analyze the new target: `(2.04, 1.96)`. Based on previous attempts, some crucial learnings have emerged.  Firstly, I need to ensure my X-coordinate is greater than 0.25 (to avoid the central wall) but less than 2.45 (avoiding the right wall). Y-coordinate needs to remain below 2.45 to prevent collision with the upper wall.  I'm also steering clear of the problematic (1.0, 1.0) region, which has been consistently unreachable. I've re-examined the obstacles, and my new target is inside two obstacles. These are obstacle 7: `((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25))` and obstacle 19: `((1.99, 1.91), (2.07, 2.00))`. The target being *within* an obstacle, and the obstacles being fixed and relatively compact, makes establishing line of sight exceedingly difficult.
           
           The general strategy to deal with these obstacles is to position myself outside of the bounding box of the obstacles, so my line of sight will not intersect.
           
           **Position 1: (1.5, 1.9).**  This puts me to the left of both obstacle 7 and the target. Distance: 0.543.  All checks are good (within range, avoids obstructions).
           
           **Position 2: (2.0, 1.5).** Placing me below both obstacle 7 and the target. Distance: 0.461. Also passing all required checks.
           
           **Position 3: (1.0, 0.5).**  Further away, a bottom-left position. Distance: 1.792. This one attempts a diagonal view to the target. It's the furthest away, yet in range. I avoid the problematic (1.0, 1.0).
           
           These three positions prioritize flanking the fixed obstacle with the target, aiming to find any possible angle that could work.  Given the situation, it's the best approach given the information I have. I am hopeful that the "no line of sight" responses are due to the target being *inside* an obstacle, which doesn't guarantee a solution, but is always worth trying, especially given the problem constraints that tell me to never give up. I am hoping for "line of sight" to try these positions.

           The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Analysis and Proposed Strategies for Target Reaching**
           
           My primary goal is to reach the new target point, which is located at (-2.0315, 0.4069) in the upper-left quadrant of the environment. I need to take into account past failures and the fixed obstacles in the map.  This target is particularly challenging due to its proximity to the left wall and the central vertical wall.
           
           Given the constraints, I will test three different strategies to maximize the chances of reaching the target:
           
           1.  **Placement to the right (closer to center):**  I'll position the robot at  (-1.0, 0.5). This location is closer to the center of the environment and provides a clearer line of sight to the target, avoiding the central wall.
           
           2.  **Below and to the right:**  I will propose a position at  (-1.5, -1.0). This location aims to bypass any potential obstructions while providing a clear angle towards the target.
           
           3.  **Above and to the left:**  I plan to test the position (-2.3, 1.0). This point allows me to survey the area, while maintaining a safe distance from the central and left walls.
           
           All three positions meet the necessary constraints: they are less than 2 units from the target, situated away from the central vertical wall (x < -0.1), and within the environment boundaries.
