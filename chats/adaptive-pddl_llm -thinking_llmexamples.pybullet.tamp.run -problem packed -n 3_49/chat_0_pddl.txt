           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning Process: A Goal Unreachable**
           
           Okay, so I'm looking at a problem where I need to get three objects (`v8`, `v12`, and `v14`) onto a specific surface (`v16`).  The initial state shows them all resting on another surface (`v11`), and I have information about their poses and grasps.  I can tell that `#o2` is a valid pose on `v16` for all three objects. The goal, essentially, is to get each of these objects to have `atpose(#o2)`.
           
           Thinking through the steps, I realize I'll need to use the `pick` and `place` actions because the only way to change the `atpose` of an object is through these actions. However, I only have `move_base` available.  `Move_base` just changes the base configuration and doesn't do anything with objects.
           
           So, I need to check the preconditions for `pick` and `place`.  To `pick` an object, I need to satisfy the `kin` relation, ensure the hand is empty, and verify no unsafe trajectories. Similarly, `place` also has `kin` and safety preconditions, along with the object being in a grasp state.
           
           Since I don't have access to pick or place, the goal of changing the pose of the objects is inherently unreachable. I've only got `move_base`. Given the constraint on only using the provided actions, and with `move_base` only changing base configuration, there's no way to manipulate the objects to get them to the desired poses.  I can't pick them up, and I can't put them down.
           
           Thus, given the limitations on action instances, I have to conclude that a plan to achieve the specified goal is not possible.
