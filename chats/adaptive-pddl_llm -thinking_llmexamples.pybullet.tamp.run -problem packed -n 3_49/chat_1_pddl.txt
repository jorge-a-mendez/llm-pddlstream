           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Unreachable Goal: A Plan-Based Dilemma**
           
           Okay, so the challenge is to get objects v8, v12, and v14 all stacked on v16. Simple enough on the surface: pick them up and put them down. But here's the rub: I've got a very limited set of tools (actions) to work with.  The initial analysis confirmed that the "on" relationship relies on the "supported" and "atpose" predicates. To move these objects, I'd need the standard *pick* and *place* actions. I examined the facts about the existing configuration and the target.  All three objects were initially stacked on v11. From here, I need to pick and place all three objects on v16.
           
           The initial plan looked straightforward:
           1.  *Pick* each object from its initial location.
           2.  *Place* each object on v16.
           
           However, the analysis revealed the critical constraint: I'm only allowed to use a single action instance: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This action doesn't actually change anything relevant to the object placement. I noticed that the required `pick` and `place` actions were not provided. These actions are fundamental to manipulating the object states, as they modify the necessary `atpose` predicate. Because only the `move_base` action is provided, I'm stuck. It's mathematically impossible to change an object's location without *pick* and *place*. Since the system prevents these actions from being employed, the goal is, unfortunately, unreachable. It's a classic case of having the goal, the initial state, and the constraints, but not the right tools.
