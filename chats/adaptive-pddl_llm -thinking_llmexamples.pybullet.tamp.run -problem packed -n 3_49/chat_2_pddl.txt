(Thoughts: **Reasoning through the Block Stacking Plan**
           
           Okay, here's how I'm thinking about this problem. The user wants me to achieve `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  That means I need to get each of these blocks, currently resting on `v11`, stacked directly on top of `v16`.
           
           First, I looked at the initial state. I know where the blocks are (`v8` is on `v11`, `v12` is on `v11`, and `v14` is on `v11`), and I know the robot is at base configuration `v3` and its arms are empty.  I also have `kin` information, meaning I have pick and place actions available.  Critically, I observed the `supported` facts: `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` can all be supported by `v16` at the same pose `#o2`.
           
           My initial thought is to make sure the robot base is at the correct location. All the `pick` and `place` actions rely on base configuration `#o3`, so I need to move from `v3` to `#o3`. Then, for each block, the plan is simple:  *pick it up* from its current location, and *place it* on `v16`.
           
           So, here's my outline:
           1.  Move the robot base: `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`.
           2.  *Pick* `v8` from pose `v9`, and *place* `v8` on `v16`.
           3.  *Pick* `v12` from pose `v13`, and *place* `v12` on `v16`.
           4.  *Pick* `v14` from pose `v15`, and *place* `v14` on `v16`.
           
           I then double-checked this plan.  I verified that the preconditions for each action are met by either the initial state or the effects of the preceding actions. The important precondition is `handempty(v4)` and `atbconf(#o3)`. I've made sure that the robot's hand is empty before each pick, and that the base is in the right configuration.
           
           I made sure this satisfies the goal; placing a block on `v16` uses the fact `supported` facts associated with `#o2`.
           
           The order of `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` doesn't matter because there are no collisions based on the simplifications in the `unsafe` facts.  They are all at different initial poses, all picked up, and all placed at the same pose, `v16`, which is where we want them.  This looks like a minimal cost plan. It should be a pretty straightforward solution.
