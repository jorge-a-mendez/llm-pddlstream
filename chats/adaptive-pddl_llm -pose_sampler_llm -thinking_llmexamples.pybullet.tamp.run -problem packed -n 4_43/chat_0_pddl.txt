(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for an object on a given surface.  The object is a square with dimensions approximately 0.097 x 0.097, and the surface is a square of size 0.27 x 0.27, centered at the origin. I know the surface index will be 0. Since the object is a square, its rotation will not affect its bounding box, meaning any rotation value (theta) will work.  I need to calculate the (surf_idx, theta, x, y) values for each placement.
           
           First, I need to define the valid range for the center (x, y) of the object, ensuring its bounding box stays within the surface's bounds.  I calculated that the x and y coordinates can range from -0.086 to 0.086.
           
           To create diverse placements, I will combine grid positions with multiple rotation values (theta). I decided to use two values for `theta`: 0 and pi/4 (0 and approximately 0.785 radians).  A 5x5 grid will cover the valid x and y range, with 5 evenly spaced values from -0.086 to 0.086 for each coordinate.  This grid will be used for both x and y.
           
           The x and y values are: [-0.086, -0.043, 0.0, 0.043, 0.086]
           
           I will use 25 placements with a theta of 0 and 25 placements with a theta of pi/4 for a total of 50.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Generating Placements for Object 4, Avoiding Collision with Object 5**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. I've received feedback on a successful placement for Object 5. Now, I need to place Object 4 on surface 0, ensuring it doesn't collide with Object 5, which is now a fixed obstacle at `(-0.08642, -0.08642)`. I'll be working with a square Object 4 with a side length of approximately `0.087`.
           
           First, I need to define the boundaries of where I can place Object 4 on surface 0, which is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I've calculated that the containment area is from `(-0.091409, -0.091409)` to `(0.091409, 0.091409)`.
           
           Object 5 has an AABB defined by `-0.135` to `-0.0378` for both x and y.
           
           To avoid collision, I need to make sure that Object 4 does not overlap with Object 5. To ensure this, the x and y coordinates of the center point of object 4 need to satisfy: x >= 0.00574 OR y >= 0.00574.
           
           To generate placements, I'll use a 7x7 grid with a step size of 0.0304698 and apply two rotations: 0 and pi/4 radians. This will ensure I generate 66 possible placements (33 positions * 2 rotations = 66 placements).
