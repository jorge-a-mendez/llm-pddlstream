User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):

           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Initial Planning for Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out three good spots for the robot base relative to a target point. Crucially, these positions need to be within a maximum distance of 2 units from the target, and the robot's orientation will automatically face the target. My big challenge is avoiding collisions with fixed obstacles in the environment. I'm going to get feedback if a proposed position is problematic due to collisions or occlusions, which will be super helpful. My goal is to come up with three diverse and valid solutions, and I won't give up easily.
           
           The setup is a square environment with boundaries defined by x: [-2.5, 2.5] and y: [-2.5, 2.5]. I've got a list of AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) representing the fixed obstacles, including walls and some smaller internal structures. My first step is understanding these obstacles in detail.
           
           After looking at the AABBs, it's clear the environment is divided by a central vertical pillar (x=0). The target point in this case is at `(-0.71, 0.44)`. Knowing the position is in the left half, I must avoid candidates to the right of the central pillar to ensure line of sight.
           
           The initial strategy is to generate candidate positions in a circle around the target, varying distance up to my max range (2), and testing at different angles. I'll need to filter these positions based on a few key checks. First, they need to be within the square environment limits ([-2.5, 2.5]). Second, I'll need to check for collision with any of the *fixed* AABBs. My current assumption is to consider the robot's base as a point for the purposes of these collision checks. I also need to account for the line of sight issues, mainly from the central pillar.
           
           I can make a simple check: if the candidate position is to the right of the central pillar (x > 0) and the target is on the left, then it is blocked. For smaller occlusions, I will use the feedback system and adapt from there.
           I'm going to start with a target, and look at candidates: I will choose angles 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees, with intermediate angles, and distances 1.5 and 1.8.
           
           Generating candidates:
           *   I can check bounds, `px` and `py` must be within `[-2.5, 2.5]`.
           *   I can check if I am colliding, i.e., my position `(px, py)` is inside an `AABB`.
           *   I will verify I can see the target from the candidate.
           
           Let's test this with the target, and see how I can use the existing AABB lists.
           *   I can check the angle, I will use `d = 1.5`, and angle `0`.
           *   I create a position.
           *   I check bounds.
           *   I check the AABBs.
           
           Testing a candidate:
           *   Check each AABB in the list.
           *   If the position is inside the AABB, it is invalid.
           
           I'll improve the checks further. To check line of sight, I'll start with the central pillar and assume a candidate that is *not* to the same side of the pillar. This is an initial assumption.
           
           I found, through my early calculations, that the collision check must be systematic, so I will define an `is_colliding` function to do this. I'll do this function for the LOS check, using `is_los_blocked_by_pillar`.
           
           Here are the target points and distances: `target_point = (-0.71, 0.44)` and distances 1.5 and 1.8.
           
           I will iterate:
           *   Angles: 90, 180, 270, 0, 45, 135, 225, 315
           *   Distance `d = 1.5` and `d = 1.8`
           
           *   For `angle=90, d=1.5`: The position will be `(-0.71, 1.94)`. I test this.
               *   It is within bounds.
               *   The central pillar will not be in the way.
               *   Obstacle 10 ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)) will be hit.
           *   For `angle=180, d=1.5`: The position will be `

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Target and Obstacles**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new target point, `(-2.102390766143799, 1.8197174072265625)`, which I'll approximate as `(-2.10, 1.82)`.  Immediately, this is different from the previous target, and my initial analysis of the central pillar's relevance is out the window.  This new point is in the top-left quadrant of the room. I need to be careful with my interpretation.
           
           The key issue here is that this target is *inside* a fixed obstacle, specifically obstacle `8: ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25))` and a smaller fixed obstacle `21`.  My understanding of line-of-sight means that if the target itself is within an obstacle, there's no way to achieve a clear view.  The feedback I received on previous positions, like `(-1.98, -0.83)`, supported this idea with a "no line of sight" error.
           
           Also, the "not reachable" feedback is the challenge. If `(-0.71, 1.44)` and `(-2.21, 0.44)` are "not reachable," that likely means there's an obstacle I'm not explicitly aware of. By the look of the bounds I should try to place my position near the target, in a location where a *non-fixed obstacle* is not present.
           
           Given the constraints, it seems unlikely any proposed position will result in a clear LOS to the target. However, the instructions say to "never give up." So, I must focus on finding positions that are:
           
           1.  Within the `max_range = 2` distance from `(-2.10, 1.82)`.
           2.  Within the room bounds, x, y = [-2.5, 2.5].
           3.  Collision-free with known fixed obstacles.
           4.  Avoiding an *inferred* obstacle roughly in the region `x: [-2.21, -0.71]` and `y: [0.44, 1.44]`.
           
           Here's what I've come up with.  I am suggesting 3 positions:
           
           *   **P1 = (-2.10, 2.26)**: Just above the main obstacle `8`.
           *   **P2 = (-2.40, 2.00)**: To the left and above obstacle `8`.
           *   **P3 = (-2.40, 0.00)**: To the left and below obstacle `8`, avoiding the "not reachable" region.
           
           The problem is the target is already inside an obstacle. I am suggesting the proposed positions while assuming the line of sight problem can be worked around.

(Thoughts: **Navigating a Shifting Target: My Thought Process**
           
           Alright, new request, new target point. But hold on... the feedback from the *last* request seems to be about a different target entirely! I'm seeing failure logs for a point that's not the one I was given. This is a bit confusing, but I need to figure out what's going on.
           
           It's likely either a typo in the feedback, some internal system shift, or a simple mistake. Let's assume the feedback's *target point* is indeed correct and that it's what the system *actually* evaluated my positions against. This implies that my previous responses for a different target were actually evaluated against a *new* one, which is quite odd.
           
           The prompt does say that the second request might be for the same point because of a previous collision and that I need to learn the scene geometry. This time around, I'm focusing on the new, updated target point.
           
           So, I'm going to take the feedback at face value for now. The feedback mentions collisions, specifically with fixed obstacles. I need to be sure to remember them while selecting positions.
           
           Specifically, if the feedback is accurate, the target is (2.09, 2.09). This falls near several fixed obstacles. Given the prompt, I'll need to stay within *max_range = 2* distance.
           
           So here's what I've got:
           
           1.  **New Target:** I am assuming the target point to be used by the system for now is the updated target (2.09, 2.09).
           2.  **Obstacle Inference:** Because the feedback is showing that the system evaluated my previous proposed positions against the target I mentioned, I need to take the feedback's collision information into account.
           3.  **Position Strategy:** I'll be choosing positions that are within the `max_range = 2` to the new target. These positions will be within the global bounds of `x: [-2.5, 2.5]` and `y: [-2.5, 2.5]`. I will need to avoid colliding with known fixed obstacles. I'll need to stay on the same side of the central pillar as the target point to have a shot at a line of sight.
           
           Since it seems like the system's focus has shifted to the new target, let's look at a few possible valid positions:
           *   (2.09, 0.09) - This is directly below, and is well within the acceptable distance. It avoids the central pillar. It does not appear to collide with other fixed obstacles.
           *   (2.4, 2.09) - This is just to the right, and also well within the acceptable distance. It looks to be outside of fixed obstacles.
           *   (0.1, 2.09) - Top-left of the target, and right of the central pillar. This one looks to avoid fixed obstacles.
           
           I've carefully checked all these against the current fixed obstacle list to ensure they don't collide. Now the biggest caveat is: The target itself is *inside* a fixed obstacle. That means line of sight will likely be blocked. However, these positions are still the best within range and in the clear of fixed obstacles.

           Specifically, if the feedback is accurate, the target is (2.09, 2.09). This falls near several fixed obstacles. Given the prompt, I'll need to stay within *max_range = 2* distance.
           
           So here's what I've got:
           
           1.  **New Target:** I am assuming the target point to be used by the system for now is the updated target (2.09, 2.09).
           2.  **Obstacle Inference:** Because the feedback is showing that the system evaluated my previous proposed positions against the target I mentioned, I need to take the feedback's collision information into account.
           3.  **Position Strategy:** I'll be choosing positions that are within the `max_range = 2` to the new target. These positions will be within the global bounds of `x: [-2.5, 2.5]` and `y: [-2.5, 2.5]`. I will need to avoid colliding with known fixed obstacles. I'll need to stay on the same side of the central pillar as the target point to have a shot at a line of sight.
           
           Since it seems like the system's focus has shifted to the new target, let's look at a few possible valid positions:
           *   (2.09, 0.09) - This is directly below, and is well within the acceptable distance. It avoids the central pillar. It does not appear to collide with other fixed obstacles.
           *   (2.4, 2.09) - This is just to the right, and also well within the acceptable distance. It looks to be outside of fixed obstacles.
           *   (0.1, 2.09) - Top-left of the target, and right of the central pillar. This one looks to avoid fixed obstacles.
           
           I've carefully checked all these against the current fixed obstacle list to ensure they don't collide. Now the biggest caveat is: The target itself is *inside* a fixed obstacle. That means line of sight will likely be blocked. However, these positions are still the best within range and in the clear of fixed obstacles.
