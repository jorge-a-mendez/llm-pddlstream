           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've derived to achieve the goal state:**
           
           My objective is to rearrange four objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`) from their initial positions on a support (`v11`) to a new designated region (`v18`). Based on the provided information, the key facts are that these objects are graspable, stackable, and currently supported on `v11`. Moreover, I've observed that all target objects are *supported* at the designated `pose #o2` on `v18`. There's one action provided: `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. However, since no base motion is required, all actions will be relative to the robot's current base configuration, `v3`. The only available actions are `pick` and `place` using the arm `v4`, a hand gripper, and trajectory/grasp parameters which are to be determined by the TAMP solver. I will therefore use `pick` and `place` action instances to manipulate the objects.
           
           The overall approach is straightforward: I will use arm `v4` to sequentially pick each object from its initial location and place it at the designated pose `#o2` on `v18`. Since all targets are supported at pose `#o2`, once the object is in that state, the goal is achieved (`on(?o, v18)`). I must assume `#o3` (base conf. used in the `kin` facts) corresponds to the current base configuration `v3`.
           
           **Plan Details:**
           
           1.  **Pick `v8`**: Arm `v4` picks `v8` at pose `v9` using the grasping parameters `#o1`, `#o3`, and `#o4`.
           2.  **Place `v8`**: Arm `v4` places `v8` at pose `#o2` on `v18` using the same grasping parameters.
           3.  **Pick `v12`**: Arm `v4` picks `v12` from `v13`.
           4.  **Place `v12`**: Arm `v4` places `v12` at pose `#o2` using the same grasping parameters.
           5.  **Pick `v14`**: Arm `v4` picks `v14` from `v15`.
           6.  **Place `v14`**: Arm `v4` places `v14` at pose `#o2` using the same grasping parameters.
           7.  **Pick `v16`**: Arm `v4` picks `v16` from `v17`.
           8.  **Place `v16`**: Arm `v4` places `v16` at pose `#o2` using the same grasping parameters.
           
           This sequence of pick and place actions ensures that each object is moved to the target location. The assumption is that the continuous parameters (#o1, #o2, #o3, #o4) exist, satisfy the precondition and will be instantiated by the TAMP solver. Also, since there are no unsafe pose/approach negative conditions provided, I can proceed with the plan. It's also important to note that the robot's mobility state is handled with `canmove()` and it must be true to start the action. The `move_base` action available can be ignored since the solution does not require base movement.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Inherent Impossibility of the Task**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a bit of a pickle. The user rightly pointed out that my previous attempt was a non-starter because I used actions that aren't in the allowed set.  I was explicitly told I'm only allowed to use `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  That's my only tool, and that presents a problem, as this will prevent me from generating a valid plan.
           
           The goal is to get several objects – `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` – all onto `v18`.  That means, in terms of my internal representation, I need to achieve `on(v8, v18)`, `on(v12, v18)`, `on(v14, v18)`, and `on(v16, v18)`.
           
           Now, according to the definition of `on`, for an object `o` to be `on` a container `r`, I need two things:  `supported(o, p, r)` and `atpose(o, p)`.  Where `p` is a pose. Looking at the initial state, I can see that `v8` is initially supported by two poses, `v9` and `#o2`, and that `v8` is at `v9`.  The initial state also has that `v8` is supported by `#o2`.
           
           Therefore, for `v8` to be on `v18`, I need it to be `atpose(v8, #o2)`. The same logic applies to `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`; they each need to be moved to `#o2`. They are currently at other poses, `v13`, `v15`, and `v17` respectively.
           
           This is where the problem becomes glaringly obvious. To change those poses, I would need `pick` and `place` actions. However, my *only* allowed action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This action, as I understand it, is for navigating the robot's base. It will change the `atbconf` and `canmove` predicates, but it simply *cannot* manipulate the objects directly. It can not perform a pick and a place, which is required to change the state.
           
           So, here's the bottom line:  given the current state and the allowed action, the goal of getting those objects onto `v18` is simply *unachievable*.  My expertise tells me a plan is not possible. I have to explain why the goal is not achievable, I can't return a plan. The problem is fundamentally flawed based on what I have available to work with.
