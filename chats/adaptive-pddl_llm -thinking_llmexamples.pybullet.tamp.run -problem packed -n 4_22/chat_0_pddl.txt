           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Unachievable Goal: A Constraint-Based Analysis**
           
           Okay, so the task is to get `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` all `on v18`. I understand that `on` is defined by `supported` and `atpose`, so I need to maneuver these objects from their current supported state on `v11` to being supported on `v18` at a specific pose.
           
           Initially, these four objects are on `v11`.  My thought process naturally heads towards a pick-and-place strategy. I'd need to pick each object from its current pose (`v9`, `v13`, `v15`, `v17` respectively) and place it at the correct pose on `v18`. I confirmed that `v18` *is* a valid receptacle based on the `supported` facts.
           
           However, the critical constraint is the allowed action instances. The only allowed action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. The problem description is very clear: *only* this specific instance is permitted.  No other actions, including the essential `pick` and `place` actions required to manipulate objects, are provided.
           
           This is where the plan breaks down.  The provided `move_base` action seems like a no-op given its preconditions and effects within this context. It essentially consumes and reproduces the `canmove()` predicate, which is not essential to solving the underlying problem. It's not a useful action for picking up or placing objects.
           
           Since I can't use `pick` or `place`, I can't change the `atpose` facts, and therefore, I can't modify the `on` state of the objects. It's a dead end. I've re-read the problem statement and the allowed action list to make sure I'm not missing anything. I've confirmed I can only use `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.
           
           Therefore, with the given constraints, this goal is *unachievable*.  No plan can be devised with the available actions. It's a fundamental limitation due to the absence of object manipulation primitives. It's unfortunate, because the problem is clear, but I am unable to come up with a valid plan with the specified parameters.
