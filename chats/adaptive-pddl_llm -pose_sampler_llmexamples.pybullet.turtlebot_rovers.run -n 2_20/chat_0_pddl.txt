User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is mostly open, with the main obstacle being a central wall along the y-axis (object 5). There are also outer walls (objects 0-4) forming a square boundary, and several smaller rectangular obstacles (objects 6-10, 11-20). The target is at (0.916 0.174). I need to find a position within a circle of radius 2 centered at (0.916 0.174).
           
           I will try to place the robot in open areas, specifically avoiding the central wall and the smaller obstacles. I will prioritize locations with good line of sight to the target and a diverse set of positions to cover different angles.
           
           Positions:
           (0.916 2.174)
           (2.916 0.174)
           (-1.084 0.174)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point has changed to (-0.3977498710155487, 2.04186749458313). This point is located in the upper-left quadrant of the scene. The previous suggestions were based on a different target, so I need to re-evaluate. The previous failures provide valuable information about obstacles:
           - (0.916, 2.174) for the old target (0.916, 0.174) collided with obstacle 9: ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)). This is relevant since the new target is also in the upper part of the scene.
           - (2.916, 0.174) was out of bounds. The x-limit is [-2.5, 2.5]. This means I cannot suggest an x-coordinate greater than 2.5.
           - (-1.084, 0.174) for the old target (0.916, 0.174) had no line of sight. This is also important to consider to avoid occlusions. The central wall (object 5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))) is a major occluder.
           
           For the new target point (-0.3977, 2.0419), I need to find positions within a circle of radius 2. The valid x-range is [-2.5, 2.5] and y-range is [-2.5, 2.5].
           
           I will avoid the area around object 9. Since the target is near object 9 and 10, I should be careful with placing the robot too close to these obstacles or behind them. The target is between objects 9 and 10.
           Object 9: ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))
           Object 10: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))
           
           I will try to place the robot to the left of object 10, or below objects 9 and 10, or to the right of object 9. I also need to make sure the robot has line-of-sight and does not collide with the central wall or the outer walls.
           
           Positions:
           (-0.3977 0.0419)
           (-2.3977 2.0419)
           (1.6023 2.0419)
