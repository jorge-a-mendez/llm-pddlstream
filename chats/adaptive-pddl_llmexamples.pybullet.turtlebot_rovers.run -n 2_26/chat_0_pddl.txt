           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers (v12, v14), a lander (v9), a camera (v10), a storage unit (v16), and several rocks and objectives. Both rovers are at specific configurations (v13 for v12, v15 for v14) and have the storage unit free. The camera v10 is onboard both rovers and supports mode v11. There are several image and communication visibility facts for both rovers, indicating they can see objectives v17 and v18, and communicate with the lander v9. They can also be above various rocks at a specific configuration.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` is an axiom that represents a complex state. Examining the definition of `new-axiom@0()`, it requires the following conditions to be true simultaneously:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`
           - `free(v12, v16)`
           - `free(v14, v16)`
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for some stone.
           - `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for some soil.
           
           Let's check the initial state against these requirements:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: True
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: True
           - `free(v12, v16)`: True
           - `free(v14, v16)`: True
           
           So, the first four conditions are already met. We need to achieve the remaining conditions.
           
           The remaining conditions are:
           1. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This means rover v12 or v14 needs to take an image of objective v17 in mode v11 and send it to the lander.
           2. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This means rover v12 or v14 needs to take an image of objective v18 in mode v11 and send it to the lander.
           3. `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for some rock of type `v2`.
           4. `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for some rock of type `v6`.
           
           Let's analyze the available actions and how they can contribute to the goal:
           - `move`: Allows changing the rover's configuration. The available `move` actions are self-loops, so they don't change the `atconf` state.
           - `take_image`: Requires `calibrated`, `onboard`, `supports`, `atconf`, `imagevisible`, and not `blocked`. It makes `haveimage` true and `calibrated` false.
           - `calibrate`: Requires `onboard`, `atconf`, `imagevisible`, and not `blocked`. It makes `calibrated` true.
           - `send_image`: Requires `comvisible`, `objective`, `mode`, `haveimage`, `atconf`, and not `blocked`. It makes `receivedimage` true.
           - `sample_rock`: Requires `above`, `store`, `atconf`, `free`. It makes `full` and `analyzed` true, and `free` false.
           - `send_analysis`: Requires `comvisible`, `rock`, `analyzed`, `atconf`, and not `blocked`. It makes `receivedanalysis` true.
           - `drop_rock`: Requires `rover`, `store`, `full`. It makes `free` true and `full` false.
           
           Since the goal requires `receivedimage` for two objectives and `receivedanalysis` for two types of rocks, we will need to use `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions.
           
           Let's identify the rocks for analysis:
           - Rocks of type `v2` (stone): v4, v1, v3.
           - Rocks of type `v6` (soil): v5, v7, v8.
           
           For imaging:
           - Rover v12 can see v17 and v18 at conf #o3.
           - Rover v14 can see v17 and v18 at conf #o3.
           - Both can communicate with lander v9 at conf #o0.
           
           For sampling and analysis:
           - Rover v12 is above v3, v7, v5, v4, v1, v8 at conf #o5.
           - Rover v14 is above v4, v3, v7, v5, v1, v8 at conf #o5.
           
           Given that `v10` is onboard both `v12` and `v14`, and supports `v11`, both rovers can use the camera.
           
           A critical observation is that the available action instances list is extremely restrictive. Only `move` and `drop_rock` actions are available. None of the actions needed to achieve `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` are in the list of available actions. This means the goal is unreachable with the given allowed actions.
           
           --Plan--:
           The goal requires `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for a stone type, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for a soil type.
           These subgoals require actions such as `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`.
           However, the only allowed action instances provided in the problem description are `move` and `drop_rock`.
           Since the necessary actions to achieve the imaging and analysis goals are not allowed, the goal is unreachable.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `The goal requires `receivedimage(v17, v11), These subgoals require actions such as `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`.), However, the only allowed action instances provided in the problem description are `move` and `drop_rock`.), Since the necessary actions to achieve the imaging and analysis goals are not allowed, the goal is unreachable.)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers (v12, v14), a lander (v9), a camera (v10), a storage unit (v16), and several rocks and objectives. Both rovers are at specific configurations (v13 for v12, v15 for v14) and have the storage unit free. The camera v10 is onboard both rovers and supports mode v11. There are several image and communication visibility facts for both rovers, indicating they can see objectives v17 and v18, and communicate with the lander v9. They can also be above various rocks at a specific configuration.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` is an axiom that represents a complex state. Examining the definition of `new-axiom@0()`, it requires the following conditions to be true simultaneously:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`
           - `free(v12, v16)`
           - `free(v14, v16)`
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for some stone.
           - `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for some soil.
           
           Let's check the initial state against these requirements:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: True
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: True
           - `free(v12, v16)`: True
           - `free(v14, v16)`: True
           
           The first four conditions are already met in the initial state.
           
           The remaining conditions are:
           1. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           2. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           3. `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for some rock of type `v2`
           4. `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for some rock of type `v6`
           
           These conditions require actions like `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. However, the provided list of allowed action instances only contains `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))`, `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`, `((drop_rock v12 v16))`, and `((drop_rock v14 v16))`. None of these actions can achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates. The `move` actions are self-loops and don't change the configuration. The `drop_rock` actions would only change the `full` and `free` predicates, which are already in the desired state (`free`).
           
           Therefore, it is impossible to achieve the goal with the given limited set of allowed actions. The problem statement explicitly states that "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           Given that the goal cannot be achieved with the allowed actions, I cannot provide a plan.
