           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Here's my approach to generating 50 stable placements for the object:**
           
           I need to position Object ID 6, with dimensions approximately 0.0985 x 0.0985, on Surface 0, which is a 0.27 x 0.27 square centered at the origin.  A placement is defined by surface index, rotation angle (theta), and the center coordinates (x, y) of the object's AABB.
           
           To ensure stability, I need to make sure the object remains entirely within the surface boundaries.  Since there are no obstacles or pre-existing objects in this case, collision checks are not needed.
           
           The key to this is understanding how the object's AABB changes with rotation.  I'm assuming the given dimensions are the dimensions of the AABB *after* any rotation of the object *within* the AABB (which is a safe assumption given the problem's phrasing).  This simplifies things.  I'll use the AABB's dimensions when rotated by `theta` to calculate the allowed center positions (x, y).
           
           Because the object is nearly square, the change in the object's AABB due to rotation will be minimal. It will still matter to maximize space utilization. Therefore, I will use a series of *theta* values and generate positions for each.
           
           I will use 6 rotation angles, ranging from 0 to 5π/6 radians, in equal intervals. For each angle, I'll calculate the valid x and y ranges for the object's center based on the rotated AABB size. I'll then generate a 3x3 grid of positions within this range for each rotation, yielding a good spread of placements.  These rotation angles are: 0, pi/6, pi/3, pi/2, 2*pi/3, and 5*pi/6. 
           
           This should give me significantly more than the required 50 placements. I will then take the first 50 from the generated list to ensure that I have exactly 50 distinct and stable positions.
           
           The implementation calculates the half-width and half-height for the rotated AABB, then determines the valid x and y ranges accordingly. The function `get_half_dims(theta)` calculates the AABB dimensions. This ensures that I consider all stable placements across multiple orientations of the object. The use of a grid approach for x and y locations helps in an even spread of objects across all of the valid space.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of how I'm tackling this object placement problem, thinking aloud:
           
           The user has given me a new task: place 50 stable instances of object ID 5 on surface 0, making sure they don't collide with any existing objects. Specifically, object ID 6 is already placed on the surface. I need to take its placement into account.
           
           First, I define my knowns. Object 6's details are provided: its size, its placement coordinates (and the fact that it's not rotated). From this, I compute its Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) – essentially the rectangular region it occupies. The dimensions of this box are based on the object's size. I determine the minimum and maximum x and y values the box occupies. Because of the orientation of object 6, it occupies the lower left quadrant of the surface.
           
           Then, I turn my attention to object 5, the new object. I also note its size, which is square and slightly smaller than object 6. Then I define the surface 0: Its bounds are specified by minimum and maximum x and y coordinates.
           
           My overall strategy is straightforward, a tried-and-true method:
           
           1.  **AABB Calculations for Object 5:** I'll calculate the dimensions of object 5's bounding box for different rotation angles. The rotation angles are going to be those that are 30 degrees apart (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 degrees).
           2.  **Valid Placement Ranges:** I'll determine the possible `(x, y)` centers for object 5 on surface 0 for each rotation, making sure that object 5 will not extend beyond surface 0's bounds.
           3.  **Collision Detection:** For each potential placement (angle and center), I need to check if object 5's bounding box collides with object 6's bounding box. I will check for AABB overlap. Overlap will mean the proposed placement will have to be rejected.
           
           This is the central part: to check for collision between two bounding boxes. I simply see if their ranges overlap (in X and in Y).
           
           Before I run everything, I lay out my surface's coordinate limits and the pre-computed AABB values for object 6.
           
           To start, I'll calculate the half widths and half heights of object 5, depending on the angles. Because the object is square, there are only two calculations to make.
           If there's no rotation, object 5 extends in X and Y directions, respectively. If there is rotation, the same extensions are true: the bounding boxes just have a different orientation.
           For this step, I consider 6 different angles: 0, pi/6, pi/3, pi/2, 2\*pi/3, 5\*pi/6.
           
           For the zero rotation, the half extents (half widths and half heights) will be the object size multiplied by one-half. Then, I can compute the `x_min_center`, `x_max_center`, `y_min_center`, `y_max_center` which will define the valid range for each coordinate. I will divide this into a 3x3 grid. However, because one placement will overlap with object 6 at this angle and grid size, the number will fall short of 50. I will increase the grid size for `x` and `y` coordinate for each rotation to find more possible placements.
           
           I am re-checking the collision check to verify it is working.
           
           Once I've got this set, I'll loop through each rotation, calculating the AABB of object 5 for different centers. I check for the x ranges and y ranges not overlapping.
           
           If there is no overlap, I add the placement and continue until I reach the 50 desired stable positions. Because there are a number of rotations, some grids will be shared.
           
           Since each object is square, some of these calculations are redundant due to symmetry. I can save some processing. I generate these as appropriate.
           
           So, for example, 30 degrees is the same as the calculations at 150 degrees, and 60 is the same as 120.
           
           After these initial runs, I'm increasing the density of the grid to get the 50 placements. I re-trace the math.
           
           After I verify the number of total possible placements in theory, I run the generation. After generating, I extract the first 50 stable positions and log them.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Finding Stable Positions**
           
           My goal is to place 50 stable instances of object ID 4 onto surface 0, avoiding collisions with the pre-existing objects, IDs 6 and 5. I've been given their positions and dimensions, including their AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) representations, and I know these objects are successfully placed and are not obstructions.
           
           Object ID 4 is a square with side size 0.0821, and surface 0 is a 0.27 x 0.27 area centered at the origin.  The pre-placed objects have the following AABB:
           * Object 6: `[-0.135, -0.0365] x [-0.135, -0.0365]`
           * Object 5: `[-0.135, -0.0493] x [0.0032, 0.0889]`
           
           To find these stable locations, I'll employ a grid-based search, while considering potential rotations of Object 4.  The dimensions of the rotated square are key: The bounding box dimensions change with rotation, so I need to account for this.
           I'll use a set of rotations: 0, pi/6, pi/3, pi/2, 2pi/3, 5pi/6 (angles where the bounding box's dimensions change).
           
           For each rotation:
           1.  Calculate the new bounding box's half extents, taking into account the rotation angle, to determine a valid placement area.
           2.  I generate a grid of potential (x, y) center points within that area, ensuring I respect the surface's boundary by adding an offset that makes sense with the rotation (I've calculated the offsets to be `0.04105`, when theta is a multiple of pi/2, and `0.0560` for the other angles.
           3.  Each potential position is then evaluated by constructing the object's AABB.
           4.  I check for collision with the existing objects' AABBs.
           5.  If no collisions, the position is valid. I'll maintain a list of valid placements.
           
           Because of the obstruction from the pre-existing objects, the collision checks are critical.  Object 6 prevents most positions in the bottom left, and object 5 obstructs a large part in the top quadrant.
           I'll then simply select the first 50 unique placements found. I'm reasonably confident in finding sufficient non-colliding positions with this approach.
