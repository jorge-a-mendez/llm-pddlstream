User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5. There's a central vertical wall at x=0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered around. Given the target point {target_point}, I will try to find positions within a radius of 2 from it, keeping in mind the known obstacles and the boundary constraints. I will prioritize positions that offer a clear line of sight, often by trying different angles and distances from the target.
           
           Positions:
           ({target_point.x + 1.5} {target_point.y})
           ({target_point.x - 1.5} {target_point.y})
           ({target_point.x} {target_point.y + 1.5})
