           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Plan to Achieve the Goal**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`.  They're currently all sitting on `v11`. It's pretty straightforward, really.  Each object needs to be picked up from its current location, and then placed onto `v16` at a specific pose.  
           
           For each object, let's say `v8`, the plan involves picking and placing.  We know where each object should go because there's this `pose` fact and `supported` fact that tells us.  For `v8`, it's something like `pose(v8, #o2)` and `supported(v8, #o2, v16)`. That means we pick `v8` up and put it on a pose `#o2` on top of `v16`. It's the same procedure for all objects.
           
           Now, the robot has to move to this `bconf #o3` and pick and place. So, let's start with moving the base: `move_base(v3, #o3, #o0)`.  Then we pick the object and place it. So let's write it down step by step:
           1.  Move the base.
           2.  Pick `v8`
           3.  Place `v8`
           4.  Pick `v12`
           5.  Place `v12`
           6.  Pick `v14`
           7.  Place `v14`
           
           That's the basic structure.  We've got our *kin*ematics facts telling us what needs to be true for the robot to do this. We can assume some facts are correct because no negative facts are provided, so we're good to go.
           
           The plan depends on the precondition `canmove()` being true, so picking and placing set this back to true.
           
           We've got to make sure all of the preconditions are met for those `pick` and `place` actions – `kin` predicates, `atpose`, `handempty` and make sure there are no unsafe locations or trajectories, which are all assumed true here.  The `on` conditions will become true once we do place the items.  And that is true because `atpose(v8, #o2)` is given for example, and we already know `supported(v8, #o2, v16)`.
           
           The final plan is this one above. It's safe since all the preconditions are met and all goals are reached.
