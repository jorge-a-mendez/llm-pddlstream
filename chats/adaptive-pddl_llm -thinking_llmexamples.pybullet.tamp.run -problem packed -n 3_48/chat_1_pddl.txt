           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The core issue here is a planning deadlock caused by the robot's base configuration.** My objective is to achieve `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  The initial state puts these objects on `v11`, and the robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both of which are initially handempty. To solve this, I need to pick up each object and place it on `v16`.
           
           Looking at `v8` specifically, I can use a `pick` action. The preconditions include: the arm and the object having a kinematic relation, the object being at its pose, the arm being handempty, and importantly, the base configuration matching the kinematic parameters.  
           
           The problem arises in the base configuration (`?q`). All the provided kinematic facts (e.g., `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`) require the base configuration to be `#o3`. However, the initial state sets the base to `v3` (`atbconf(v3)`).  The robot's only `move_base` action is essentially a no-op, moving from `v3` to `v3`. This action maintains the current `atbconf(v3)` and does *not* set `atbconf(#o3)`. Consequently, the `atbconf(?q)` precondition for any `pick` or `place` action, where the base configuration is `#o3`, will *never* be satisfied.
           
           This fundamentally prevents the robot from performing any pick-and-place operation with the defined parameters. Therefore, the overall goal of arranging `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` on `v16` is unreachable given the current action set and initial configuration. The base can't move to the required configuration. The problem is a planning impasse.
