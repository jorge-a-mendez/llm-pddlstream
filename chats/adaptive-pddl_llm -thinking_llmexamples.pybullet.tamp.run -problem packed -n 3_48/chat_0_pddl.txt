           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Inaccessible Goal State**
           
           Okay, here's the situation. I'm given a goal that requires moving objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`. Currently, they're all resting on `v11`. To accomplish this, I'd need to leverage the `on` axiom: something is "on" another thing if it is supported by the other thing and also at a particular pose.
           
           Analyzing the initial state, I see that these objects are currently supported by `v11`.  To achieve the goal, I need to get each object `atpose` and `supported` by `v16`.  This calls for a standard pick-and-place operation. I need to:
           
           1.  Pick each object from `v11`.
           2.  Place each object onto `v16`.
           
           Looking at the available actions, I'd use `pick` and `place` actions, which each rely on some preconditions such as `kin`, `handempty`, etc.
           
           The issue is this: the only *allowed* action instance I have is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This is effectively a no-op, since it moves the robot from base configuration `v3` to the same base configuration `v3`. It negates then adds `canmove()` so this action does nothing.
           
           The problem, then, is that the given list of allowed action instances *does not* include the necessary `pick` or `place` actions.  Since I'm constrained to use *only* the actions provided, and the provided actions do not involve picking and placing, I'm stuck. It's impossible to reach the goal state using the given action instances, given the problem's constraints.
