           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of Achieving new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate goal, `new-axiom@0()`, boils down to establishing certain facts about the rovers, the images they capture, and the analyses they perform. Specifically, I need to ensure both rovers, `v12` and `v14`, are at their initial configurations (which they already are), have a free storage location, and have successfully received and analyzed both stone and soil samples. The problem is, and this is crucial, the *only* `move` actions allowed are "do-nothing" actions – rovers essentially remaining in their initial positions.
           
           My initial thought was to leverage `v12` and `v14` to acquire images (via `take_image`) and analyze rocks and soil samples. However, a closer examination of the preconditions for these actions reveals a fatal flaw. They all require the rovers to be at specific configurations (like `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5`) to work. But the only "move" actions I'm given don't change the rovers' locations. The permitted `move` actions simply ensure that the current configuration remains unchanged.
           
           This creates a serious conflict. While the problem allows for, and even encourages, continuous values for configurations like `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5`, the lack of real `move` actions means I can't *actually* put the rovers in those configurations. My reasoning is as follows: If I can't position the rovers to be in the positions where they can *see* the target rocks and soil, nor can I sample nor send analyses. This makes taking images and performing the analyses impossible, meaning I can never get the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates to hold true.
           
           Therefore, because of the restricted `move` actions, I have to conclude that it is impossible to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. This is because the rovers' positions are fixed, preventing the required interactions with the environment to achieve the goal state. This seems counterintuitive and probably requires revisiting the constraints set by the available actions.
