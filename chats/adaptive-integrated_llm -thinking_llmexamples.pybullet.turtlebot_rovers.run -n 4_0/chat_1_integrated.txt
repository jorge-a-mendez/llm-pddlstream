           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **A Detailed Plan to Achieve the New Axiom**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with figuring out a way to satisfy this new axiom, `new-axiom@0()`, in the `rovers` domain.  It's a pretty involved goal, requiring a lot of conditions to be met simultaneously: making sure images are received, analyses are sent, and the rover is in the correct configuration. It seems like the core challenge is the image and analysis transfer, and the need to maneuver the rover.
           
           First, I need to make sure I understand what's already true in the initial state. Fortunately, a few of the conditions, like the `atconf` and `free` predicates, are already satisfied.  That’s a small win!
           
           The trickier part is getting those images and analyses.  I’ve identified that to get the images, I’ll need to use the `send_image` action, which means I have to take those images first.  To take them, I need `take_image`, which, in turn, requires `calibrate`. So, it's a sequence: *calibrate*, *take image*, *send image*. I need to do this for each of the four objectives.
           
           I've taken a close look at the initial state and the objects involved.  There are rovers, landers, objectives for imaging, a camera, a store for rock samples, and the types of rocks I need to analyze. Based on the object attributes, I can make some deductions. The camera on Rover `v12` is able to see all of the objectives `v17, v18, v19, v20` and the lander, and it is capable of taking and sending images in `mode(v11)`.
           
           So, it seems logical to use Rover `v12` to take and transmit all the image data. I've identified the locations, based on the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates, for optimal imaging and communication. I have an imaging location (`#o3`) for each objective and a central communication point that is also in a valid state `(v13)`.
           
           My initial strategy revolves around focusing Rover `v12` to get its job done.
           
           Here’s the plan I came up with:
           
           1.  **Move Rover `v12` to the imaging location (`#o3`).**
           2.  **Calibrate the camera `v10` on `v12` for the first objective (`v17`)**.
           3.  **Take the image of `v17`**.
           4.  **Calibrate the camera `v10` on `v12` for the second objective (`v18`)**.
           5.  **Take the image of `v18`**.
           6.  **Calibrate the camera `v10` on `v12` for the third objective (`v19`)**.
           7.  **Take the image of `v19`**.
           8.  **Calibrate the camera `v10` on `v12` for the fourth objective (`v20`)**.
           9.  **Take the image of `v20`**.
           
           This completes the first part: the image transfers. Then:
           
           10. **Move Rover `v12` to the communication location** (which is also the initial position, but it needs to be made explicit for the planner).
           11. **Send the image of `v17` to the lander**.
           12. **Send the image of `v18` to the lander**.
           13. **Send the image of `v19` to the lander**.

Model:     **A Detailed Plan to Achieve the New Axiom**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with figuring out a way to satisfy this new axiom, `new-axiom@0()`, in the `rovers` domain.  It's a pretty involved goal, requiring a lot of conditions to be met simultaneously: making sure images are received, analyses are sent, and the rover is in the correct configuration. It seems like the core challenge is the image and analysis transfer, and the need to maneuver the rover.
           
           First, I need to make sure I understand what's already true in the initial state. Fortunately, a few of the conditions, like the `atconf` and `free` predicates, are already satisfied.  That’s a small win!
           
           The trickier part is getting those images and analyses.  I’ve identified that to get the images, I’ll need to use the `send_image` action, which means I have to take those images first.  To take them, I need `take_image`, which, in turn, requires `calibrate`. So, it's a sequence: *calibrate*, *take image*, *send image*. I need to do this for each of the four objectives.
           
           I've taken a close look at the initial state and the objects involved.  There are rovers, landers, objectives for imaging, a camera, a store for rock samples, and the types of rocks I need to analyze. Based on the object attributes, I can make some deductions. The camera on Rover `v12` is able to see all of the objectives `v17, v18, v19, v20` and the lander, and it is capable of taking and sending images in `mode(v11)`.
           
           So, it seems logical to use Rover `v12` to take and transmit all the image data. I've identified the locations, based on the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates, for optimal imaging and communication. I have an imaging location (`#o3`) for each objective and a central communication point that is also in a valid state `(v13)`.
           
           My initial strategy revolves around focusing Rover `v12` to get its job done.
           
           Here’s the plan I came up with:
           
           1.  **Move Rover `v12` to the imaging location (`#o3`).**
           2.  **Calibrate the camera `v10` on `v12` for the first objective (`v17`)**.
           3.  **Take the image of `v17`**.
           4.  **Calibrate the camera `v10` on `v12` for the second objective (`v18`)**.
           5.  **Take the image of `v18`**.
           6.  **Calibrate the camera `v10` on `v12` for the third objective (`v19`)**.
           7.  **Take the image of `v19`**.
           8.  **Calibrate the camera `v10` on `v12` for the fourth objective (`v20`)**.
           9.  **Take the image of `v20`**.
           
           This completes the first part: the image transfers. Then:
           
           10. **Move Rover `v12` to the communication location** (which is also the initial position, but it needs to be made explicit for the planner).
           11. **Send the image of `v17` to the lander**.
           12. **Send the image of `v18` to the lander**.
           13. **Send the image of `v19` to the lander**.
           14. **Send the image of `v20` to the lander**.
           
           Now for the analyses! I need to sample, and then send. The same logic follows, based on `comvisible`.
           
           15. **Move to the sampling location `#o5`.**
           16. **Sample rock `v1` (stone)**.
           17. **Drop the sampled rock `v1`**.
           18. **Sample rock `v5` (soil)**.
           19. **Move to the communication location** (Same as before, at `#o0`).
           20. **Send the analysis of rock `v1`**.
           21. **Send the analysis of rock `v5`**.
           22. **Drop the second sampled rock `v5`**.
           23. **Finally, move back to the initial configuration (i.e. `v13`)**.
           
           I've ensured to identify each parameter for the actions.

(Thoughts: **Addressing the Collision and Constructing a Revised Plan**
           
           The initial plan failed due to a collision between rover `v12`'s configurations `#o3` and `#o5` and the obstacle `v21` (a thin wall at x=0). I need to re-evaluate the configurations for imaging (`#o3`) and sampling (`#o5`) to avoid these collisions.
           
           First, I re-examined the spatial relationships of all the objects, including the rover's starting position at `(1.0, -1.75)`.  I noted that the obstacle `v21` at x=0 restricts the rover's position. My imaging and sampling configurations must avoid the x-coordinate range of `-0.05` to `0.05`.
           
           **Revising the Imaging Configuration (`#o3`)**:
           
           The crux of the problem lies in imaging four objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`) using a single `#o3` configuration. To see these objectives, one option would be to place the rover at some value for `x`, but this conflicts with the requirement of avoiding the obstacle `v21` on the x-axis. As this is a planning problem, I could not choose a `z` coordinate that would allow me to look over the obstacle.
           
           My strategy involves placing `v12` far enough from `v21` (outside of `-0.05` and `0.05`) to image all the objectives. Given their x-coordinates, I need to choose configurations for `v12` that are outside of `[-0.05, 0.05]` to image the objectives:
           *   `#o3_v17 = (0.5, 1.0)`
           *   `#o3_v18 = (-0.5, 1.0)`
           *   `#o3_v19 = (1.8, 1.0)`
           *   `#o3_v20 = (-1.8, 1.0)`
           These have different values to achieve image visibility for the different objectives, and will be rendered with the same label `#o3`.
           
           **Revising the Sampling Configuration (`#o5`)**:
           
           Similarly, I need to reposition the rover for rock sampling. I must avoid `x=0`. The rocks to sample have both positive and negative x coordinates:
           *   To sample `v1`, I'll use  `#o5_v1 = (-1.5, 1.5)`.
           *   To sample `v5`, I'll use  `#o5_v5 = (1.0, -0.4)`.
           
           **Communication Configuration (`#o0`):**
           
           The lander `v9` is located at coordinates, and the initial state of the rover and the lander are far enough apart that `v12` must reposition to communicate. The plan cannot use `v13`. Because the rover must move to lander `v9` for the final step in the plan, I also need to make sure this step doesn't collide. The initial state and the lander `v9` have large x values. Therefore, communication will not collide. The coordinates I must use are  `q_com_v9 = (-1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           **The Revised Plan**:
           
           The finalized plan leverages the insights above, with these continuous parameters for the plan's motion (in this order):
           1.  Move to `q_img_v19`.
           2.  Calibrate and image `v19`.
           3.  Move to `q_img_v17`.
           4.  Calibrate and image `v17`.
           5.  Move to `q_sam_v5`.
           6.  Sample, and drop, `v5`.
           7.  Move to `q_img_v18`.
           8.  Calibrate and image `v18`.
           9.  Move to `q_img_v20`.
           10. Calibrate and image `v20`.
           11. Move to `q_sam_v1`.
           12. Sample, and drop, `v1`.
           13. Move to `q_com_v9`.
           14. Send Images and Analysis.

           16. Move to `q_start`.

(Thoughts: **The Reachability Conundrum: A Detailed Analysis**
           
           I'm facing a critical issue: the feedback indicates that the specified configurations for rover `v12` are "not reachable for robot base." This means the robot physically cannot get to the locations I've designated. I need to re-evaluate how `v12` and its counterpart, `v14`, can actually move within this environment.
           
           Here's what I'm dealing with:
           
           *   **The Scene:** There's a "thin wall" (`v21`) at x=0, which seems to restrict the rovers to their respective sides. `v12` starts at (1.0, -1.75), and `v14` starts at (-1.0, -1.75). There are objectives for imaging and rocks for sampling, all positioned at various (x,y) coordinates within the map.
           *   **The Reachability Problem:** The error message, "not reachable for robot base," is a roadblock. It means the chosen (x,y) coordinates are either too far, blocked by the environment, or perhaps violate some implicit movement rule that is not explicitly modeled. This is where I am facing the most resistance.
           *   **The Key Challenge:** I must navigate a system where the "reachable for robot base" constraint seems at odds with the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates, which imply that both rovers can see and communicate with all necessary objects. The crux is that if the rovers can't move to where they have clear line-of-sight, the mission is effectively impossible.
           
           **Initial Plan & Problems**
           
           My initial attempts focused on small movements, staying near the starting positions and minimizing travel distance. I reasoned that by keeping the configurations close, they would be more likely to be considered "reachable". I then analyzed the scene to determine which rover has the best position to see/sample any given target (and to make sure they can see the lander).
           
           However, after many attempts, the system consistently rejected these configurations. The "not reachable" error persisted, even when the configurations were barely moved from the starting points.
           
           **A Deeper Look: Rover Abilities & Scene Geometry**
           
           Looking at the problem from a new perspective, I have been trying to address the following:
           
           *   **Implicit vs. Explicit Constraints:** The presence of the "thin wall" suggests that a fundamental obstacle exists. Despite its thin size, I need to know whether the robot base can move to points beyond it, for example in a region where it would block the vision field.
           *   **The Role of Distance:** If the rovers have a movement radius, then if targets are located outside that radius, then the mission is impossible. This implies, if the "reachability" rule is based on the 2m camera range, then the plan is impossible as all objects are >2m away from the start.
           
           **A More Refined Approach**
           
           Given this, I've had to consider a different path. I need to test specific configurations as my chosen motion predicates, even if this is outside the common sense approach to motion.
           
           **New Path of Reasoning:** I must assume the error arises from the (x,y) values. I must pick Y values closer to the objectives, while still satisfying the key points: `distance <= imagerange=2m`, staying outside `v21` and also minimize distance from current position. If I can't image and sample with a radius of motion, the mission is impossible.
           
           **The Final Attempt**
           
           I've formulated a detailed action sequence where `v12` is tasked with imaging and sampling from locations with minimal base movement, using these parameters:
           For `v12`: `(0.8, 0.2)` is to image `v17`; `(1.8, -0.1)` is to image `v19`; `(1.8, -1.0)` is to sample `v3`, `(1.0, -0.6)` for `v5`; and `(0.8, -1.0)` for communication.
           For `v14`: `(-0.8, 0.5)` is to image `v18` and `(-1.6, 0.5)` is to image `v20`.
           And I am letting `v14` transmit all data (to maintain simplicity for this system).
           This attempt will be the last resort if it does not work.

           **The Final Attempt**
           
           I've formulated a detailed action sequence where `v12` is tasked with imaging and sampling from locations with minimal base movement, using these parameters:
           For `v12`: `(0.8, 0.2)` is to image `v17`; `(1.8, -0.1)` is to image `v19`; `(1.8, -1.0)` is to sample `v3`, `(1.0, -0.6)` for `v5`; and `(0.8, -1.0)` for communication.
           For `v14`: `(-0.8, 0.5)` is to image `v18` and `(-1.6, 0.5)` is to image `v20`.
           And I am letting `v14` transmit all data (to maintain simplicity for this system).
           This attempt will be the last resort if it does not work.

(Thoughts: **Understanding and Addressing Action Instance Constraints**
           
           My initial attempts faltered because I was using dynamically generated configuration names within action calls, like `#o3_v17_v12`.  The planner, however, strictly adheres to a predefined list of valid action instances which utilize only generic configurations: `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`. This is the core issue. I must use these generic names within all plan actions.
           
           The problem statement further complicates this by requiring specific continuous values for each (rover, target) pair.  Specifically, if a plan uses an object `#<name>` (starting with `#`) where `conf(rover, #<name>)` is true initially and `#<name>` appears as the second argument to `imagevisible` or `comvisible`, then a continuous value must be provided for that configuration. Crucially, the plan *syntax* (using generic `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`) must align with the requirement to provide *specific* continuous values.
           
           Here's my revised understanding:
           
           1.  **Action Instances:** I must exclusively use the generic configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` within my `motion`, `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions.
           2.  **Configuration Values:**  Within the `--Configurations--` section, I need to specify the continuous values for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`, associating each value with the specific (rover, target) pair it represents within the plan. For instance, if the plan includes `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)`, I need to define a continuous value for `#o3` related to the pair `(v12, v17)`.
           
           The key breakthrough is the explicit realization that the planner expects the generic configuration names in the actions themselves, *and then* I define the specific values they represent in the `--Configurations--` section, keyed to (rover, target) pairs. I was getting bogged down in naming conventions, which was incorrect.
           
           Given the spatial constraints (obstacle `v21`, rover locations) and task requirements, I've divided the work between two rovers: `v12` (positive X) and `v14` (negative X).
           
           **Rover v12 Plan:**
           *   Move to a position (`#o3`) to image `v17`.
           *   Calibrate and `take_image` of `v17`.
           *   Move to a position (`#o3`) to image `v19`.
           *   Calibrate and `take_image` of `v19`.
           *   Move to a position (`#o5`) to sample rock `v3` (type `v2`).
           *   `drop_rock`.
           *   Move to a position (`#o5`) to sample rock `v5` (type `v6`).
           *   `drop_rock`.
           *   Move to a communication position (`#o0`).
           *   `send_image` for `v17`, `v19`.
           *   `send_analysis` for `v3`, `v5`.
           *   Move back to starting configuration.
           
           **Rover v14 Plan:**
           *   Move to a position (`#o3`) to image `v18`.
           *   Calibrate and `take_image` of `v18`.
           *   Move to a position (`#o3`) to image `v20`.
           *   Calibrate and `take_image` of `v20`.
           *   Move to a communication position (`#o0`).
           *   `send_image` for `v18`, `v20`.
           *   Move back to starting configuration.
           
           I need to confirm all preconditions are met for a valid plan. Crucially: `motion` predicates (valid transitions using allowed instances), `atconf`, `calibrated`, `onboard`, `supports`, `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` all require specific attention. In my revised plan, the `move` actions will be used to switch between generic configurations. For instance, v12 will alternate between `#o3`, `#o5` and `#o0` as necessary. This handles all required transitions. The `free` predicate, `v12` starts `free`, sampling makes it `full`, and `drop_rock` makes it free at end. This must hold. The spatial constraints for avoiding collisions with `v21` (particularly the `ray` tests from the given locations) also need review.
           
           My plan employs `v3` and `v5` that are on the positive X side to
