(Thoughts: **Stable Object Placements on Surface 0**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for an object on surface 0, an AABB defined by the coordinates ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)). The object is a square with dimensions 0.07 x 0.07.  A placement is defined as (surf_idx, theta, x, y), where theta is the rotation, and (x, y) is the center of the object's bounding box.
           
           The object's bounding box changes size with rotation. For theta = 0 or pi/2, the bounding box is 0.07 x 0.07. For theta = pi/4 (and similar angles), it's 0.07 * sqrt(2) by 0.07 * sqrt(2). To ensure the placements are stable regardless of rotation, I'll use the bounding box dimensions from theta = pi/4 in the calculations.
           
           Given the surface's dimensions, I calculated the allowed center coordinates, x and y, for the object to fit entirely within the surface. The center x values range from 4.249495 to 4.750505, and the y values range from -0.550505 to -0.049495.
           
           To create diversity, I'll use a grid of points within this allowed range. I'll use 10 points along the x-axis and 5 points along the y-axis, resulting in a 10x5 grid.  This ensures I have enough placements.  I'll alternate the rotation angle theta, cycling between 0, pi/4, and pi/2 to increase diversity in the placements. With this strategy, I'm confident I can provide 50 stable and varied object placements.

(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy Refinement for Object ID 10**
           
           After reviewing the feedback on the previous object (ID 5) and its placement failures, particularly at rotations of π/4, I've identified the root cause: *insufficient precision* in calculating the effective AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) for rotated objects.  Specifically, the failure to account for slight rounding errors when computing the margins for the object's center. This led to positions near the edge of the calculated valid region, exceeding the surface boundaries when rotated.
           
           To address this, for the new object (ID 10), which is a square (approximately 0.097714 units per side), I'm adopting a *conservative approach*. I will use the maximum effective dimensions that *could* be occupied for any orientation (which occurs at π/4 for squares). This means I will set W_eff_max and H_eff_max to equal 0.097714 * sqrt(2) which is approximately 0.13819000000000003, for both dimensions.
           
           Using these values, I've re-calculated the allowed center range for this object on Surface 0:  ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)). The allowed range for x is [4.2690950000000005, 4.7309049999999995], and the allowed range for y is [-0.5309049999999999, -0.06909500000000001].
           
           To ensure stable placements, I will sample 5 x values (4.269095, 4.3845475, 4.5, 4.6154525, 4.730905) and 5 y values (-0.530905, -0.4154525, -0.3, -0.1845475, -0.069095) for a total of 25 (x, y) coordinates. Then I'll combine these coordinates with 3 angle values (0, π/4, π/2), ensuring that I get a well-distributed and stable set of 75 placements.
           
           I am confident this method will prevent any stability problems, as it's based on the most extreme dimensions possible for a rotated square object.
           
           Finally, I will generate the 50 placements as requested.
