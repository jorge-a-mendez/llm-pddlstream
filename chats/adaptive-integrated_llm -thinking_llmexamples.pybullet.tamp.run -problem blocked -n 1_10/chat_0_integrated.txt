User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.291, 0.353), (-4.209, 0.435)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.25, 0.394, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.996, 0.094).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)

           Atom stackable(v8, v18)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom controllable(v4)

           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom graspable(v15)

           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object (`?green`) of a specific type "on" another object (`v18`). The initial knowledge base suggests `v8` and `v12` could be suitable candidates for `?green` as they satisfy the type constraint.
           
           Now, "on" means `supported` *and* `atpose`.  So, I need either `v8` or `v12` to be `supported` on `v18` *and* be at a pose where they are `supported`.  The initial state indicates `v8` is on `v11` and `v12` is on `v14`. I can see that either `v8` and `v12` can be supported on `v18`.
           
           However, here's the critical snag:  I'm only given *one* action instance: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This moves the robot base, but it can't pick up or put down any of these objects. To get something *on* `v18`, I need to pick it up from its current location and place it on `v18`.  That requires `pick` and `place` actions.
           
           Since the problem explicitly forbids using any actions *not* in the provided list, and `pick` and `place` are absent, it's a dead end. The `move_base` action won't get me anywhere; it's a no-op, basically. In fact, running this move will only make `canmove()` false, which is not helpful for *any* action. I need those pick-and-place actions. The goal is simply unreachable with the constraints given. I'm stuck, and must state that the goal cannot be achieved given the restricted action set.
