User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.291, 0.353), (-4.209, 0.435)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.25, 0.394, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.996, 0.094).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Achieving the Goal**
           
           My primary goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a certain type (`type ?green v17`) *on* a specific surface (`on ?green v18`).  After carefully reviewing the initial state, I've concluded that the object in question, `?green`, can be either `v12` or `v8`. However, given the available information, the most direct path appears to involve placing `v8` onto `v18`.
           
           To place an object, I must have both `atpose(v8, ?p)` and `supported(v8, ?p, v18)`.  I've identified that `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is a relevant fact in the initial state. This, plus the given facts, led me to conclude that `#o2` is the ideal pose. Since `v8` is currently supported at `v9` and not on `v18`, I must move `v8`.
           
           The solution involves a plan to "pick" then "place". The only continuous parameters were, the continuous parameters that are part of the initial problem setup, `kin`,  `atbconf`, and `atpose`, as well as the initial `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. I determined that I could pick the actions I need to resolve the problem. I decided on a two-step plan:
           
           1.  **Pick:** "pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4" - Grasping `v8` at location `v9`. `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)` is needed for pick.
           2.  **Place:** "place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4" - placing `v8` at a new pose (`#o2`) on `v18`.  Given the initial `kin`, `atbconf`, `atpose`, and `supported` facts, I could generate a valid plan of *Pick* and *Place*.
           
           Because I found a complete state with only these two steps, the available action `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))` is not needed.
           
           The critical piece of the plan is finding the continuous values. I then defined:
           *   **#o2**:  The pose to place `v8` on `v18`.  Through analysis of the object sizes and supported states, the chosen pose is (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0).
           *   **#o1**: The grasp location for `v8`.
           *   **#o3**:  Base configuration `v3`.
           *   **#o4**: Arm trajectory (an atraj).
           
           With this, I created a two-step plan that guarantees `(on v8 v18)` and `type(v8, v17)`. The total cost is 2, and the goal is achieved.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis: Goal Unreachable with Available Actions**
           
           Okay, I've taken a look at the user's feedback and re-evaluated the situation.  It's clear that the initial plan won't work because the key actions, `pick` and `place`, aren't in the list of valid actions. The only permitted action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.
           
           Now, let's break down the actual problem. The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to the more concrete requirement of having some object (let's call it "?green") be *on*  `v18`.  We can only satisfy this by getting either `v8` or `v12` to be `on v18`.
           
           To make either `v8` or `v12` *on* `v18`, we need to change their `atpose` predicates.  Currently, `v8` is `on v11` and `v12` is `on v14`.  Both `v8` and `v12` are supported by `v18` at a different pose (object #o2).  The only way to modify this is with `pick` and `place` actions, because those actions are the only ones that interact with `atpose`.
           
           However, here's the rub. The provided `move_base` action doesn't touch the predicates that are relevant to achieving the goal, namely `atpose` and `atgrasp`. It only changes `atbconf` and `canmove` which are irrelevant to the goal.
           
           Therefore, because `pick` and `place` are unavailable, and `move_base` has no effect on those predicates, I'm forced to conclude that the goal is currently unreachable.  There's no path to modify the object poses with the given action set. The plan is dead in the water.
