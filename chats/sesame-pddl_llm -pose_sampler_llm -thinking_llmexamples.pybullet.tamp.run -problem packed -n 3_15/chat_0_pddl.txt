(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Stable Object Positions**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5) on surface 0. This square is 0.0958 units on each side. Surface 0 is a square as well, centered at (0,0) with bounds from -0.135 to 0.135.  The tricky part is ensuring these placements are *stable*, meaning the object stays entirely within surface 0 and doesn't collide with anything, even after being rotated.
           
           Since the object is a square, its bounding box size *doesn't* change with rotations of 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees. However, when the object is rotated by 45 degrees (or 135 degrees), its *axis-aligned bounding box* gets bigger. Its effective dimensions are related to the half-diagonal of the square, or `obj_half_side * sqrt(2)`.
           
           To handle this, I'm using the most restrictive case for the object's AABB (when rotated by pi/4) to define the safe range for x and y center coordinates.  The valid x and y coordinates are approx `[-0.0672, 0.0672]`. This range ensures *any* object rotation will keep the object within surface 0.
           
           So, I've created a grid of 8 x-coordinates and 7 y-coordinates within this safe range, and then combined them with 8 different rotation angles (theta) to get 50 unique placements.  This ensures I get a diverse set of positions that are guaranteed to be stable, no matter how the object is rotated.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Collision Avoidance and Surface Constraints**
           
           I've been tasked with placing a new object, ID 4, on a surface where object ID 5 already has a successful placement. My primary goal is to avoid any collision between these two objects. The challenge lies in efficiently determining valid positions for object 4 while considering both surface boundaries and the existing object's location.
           
           First, I established the bounding box (AABB) of object 5 based on its known position and dimensions. This involves calculating its minimum and maximum x and y coordinates.  Since object 5 is a square, the AABB is straightforward, aligned with the axes. This process allows me to precisely define the space occupied by object 5 on the surface.
           
           Next, I determined the surface's valid area, which is a rectangular region. My primary constraint is that object 4's center must be within this valid region, taking into account its own dimensions. To accommodate the case of a rotated object (theta != 0), I computed the effective half-side length of object 4's AABB for different angles, as the orientation affects how much space it will take up.
           
           To ensure collision-free placements, I devised a strategy based on "safe zones" relative to object 5. The basic principle is to place object 4 outside the potential collision zone of object 5. I calculated the collision zone as the region where object 4's AABB could overlap with object 5's AABB for any given rotation.
           
           I generated valid placements for object 4 by creating potential positions to the right and above object 5 using a set to store unique placements. This strategy ensures no actual overlap occurs, even with the object rotated. I generated 50 unique placements across different angles (0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, pi/2, 2*pi/3, 3*pi/4, 5*pi/6, pi, 7*pi/6, 5*pi/4, 4*pi/3, 3*pi/2, 10*pi/6, 7*pi/4, 11*pi/6). My code will choose the first 50 unique options to return as output. I then proceeded to calculate an efficient set of non-collision scenarios (right of, left of, above, below). This allows me to create a diverse and reliable selection of object placements.

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's break down this placement problem systematically.** I'm tasked with finding 50 stable positions for a new square object (Object 6) on Surface 0, a 0.27m x 0.27m square centered at (0,0). The tricky part is avoiding collisions with two existing objects, Object 5 and Object 4.
           
           **First, the geometry.** I've got the extents and rotation information for Object 6, which I use to calculate its Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) half-extents, 'h_6', based on the rotation angle (theta_6). For Object 5 and 4, which are squares with the same extents, I can establish their AABB's simply by using the given extents and the existing rotation (which is 0.0 in this instance).
           
           **Next, the obstacles.** Object 5 is located near the bottom-left corner of the surface, and Object 4 is adjacent to it on the right, essentially forming an L-shaped region of obstruction.  I calculated the exact AABB coordinates for each obstacle:  Object 5 sits between  `x: [-0.1151, -0.0193]`, `y: [-0.1151, -0.0193]` and Object 4 sits between `x: [-0.0193, 0.0780]`, `y: [-0.1350, -0.0377]`.  Note that the x-interval of object 4 is the same as the right x-value of object 5, which means they are touching!
           
           **Placement strategy is where things get interesting.**  For each potential rotation of Object 6, I need to ensure it doesn't overlap with either obstacle. This involves calculating the valid range for the object's center `(x_6, y_6)` on the surface while simultaneously ensuring the AABB of Object 6 stays clear of the AABBs for Objects 4 and 5. The key is in those AABBs.
           
           The general approach is to make a grid and analyze each point:
           I decided to use a denser grid within the surface boundaries.  To handle collision, it is imperative to verify that Object 6 is not overlapping with objects 5 and 4.  The final result provides 50 valid placements (0.0, rotation, x, y) for the square object.
