           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning**
           
           Okay, here's the approach I've laid out to generate 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0. My goal is to find valid `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)` tuples, where the object's AABB is contained within the surface's AABB.
           
           First, I need to account for rotation. I understand the object's dimensions (`obj_size_x`, `obj_size_y`) are for the non-rotated AABB, and the parameter `theta` is the rotation angle. So, I need to calculate the *new* AABB dimensions after rotation, which I'll call `bbox_width` and `bbox_height`:
           
           *   `bbox_width = abs(obj_size_x * cos(theta)) + abs(obj_size_y * sin(theta))`
           *   `bbox_height = abs(obj_size_x * sin(theta)) + abs(obj_size_y * cos(theta))`
           
           Given that I know the object and surface sizes.
           
           To ensure stability (full containment), I've derived the valid ranges for the object's center `(x, y)`:
           
           *   `x` must be within `[s0_lower_x + bbox_width / 2, s0_upper_x - bbox_width / 2]`
           *   `y` must be within `[s0_lower_y + bbox_height / 2, s0_upper_y - bbox_height / 2]`
           
           The object is nearly square, so the maximum AABB dimensions after rotation (at 45 degrees) will be relatively small compared to the surface's size, meaning I can probably fit the object at any angle.
           
           To generate 50 placements, I'll take this approach:
           
           1.  **Angle Selection:** I'll sample `theta` from 0 to 2*pi, using 10 evenly spaced angles. This will give a variety of rotations.
           2.  **Position Selection:** For each angle, I'll calculate the valid `x` and `y` ranges using the formulas above. Then, I'll select 5 `(x, y)` positions within that range.  I'll ensure I sample distinct positions.
           
           To sample the position for each angle, I will use:
              1. The center of the valid region.
              2. four distinct position near corners of valid region
              3. The position will use the range to compute the offset.
                a. If range is small, then position will collapse to center to avoid the invalid range.
           3.  **Placement Creation:** Finally, for each angle and `(x, y)` pair, I'll generate a `(0, theta, x, y)` tuple, representing the placement on surface 0.
           
           Since this is the first request for this object and surface, I'm not yet concerned about avoiding collisions with other objects. My focus is purely on generating stable placements within the bounds of the given surface and object dimensions. The code then produces the 50 placements.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement and Collision Avoidance: A Strategy**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a new object (ID 4) on Surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into the already-placed object (ID 5).  I know object 5 is at (0, 0, 0, 0), and I've got its dimensions, and I know the dimensions and bounds of Surface 0.
           
           To tackle this, I'm going to follow these steps:
           
           1.  **Calculate the Bounding Boxes:** I need to figure out the areas the objects occupy. I'll get the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of Object 5, which is simple because it's already placed. I'll also figure the same for object 4. I know that since the object 4's dimensions in X and Y are almost the same, then at a pi/4 rotation, it will occupy the most area. 
           2.  **Determine Valid Placement Regions:** Now comes the key part. Surface 0 has limited space. Object 4 can't go outside those limits, plus I need to make sure there's no collision with Object 5. I will make a helper function to decide if a point is valid.
           3.  **Generate Placement Candidates:** I will focus on 10 rotations, and for each rotation, I will generate 5 distinct points. 
                *   The first four are the corners of the surface, if those are valid, where the new object will not intersect the old.
                *   The fifth is for "safe zones" where an object edge lies inside the safe zones.
           
           I'm confident this method will find those 50 stable, collision-free placements on Surface 0!

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable positions for Object 6 on Surface 0, avoiding collisions with the existing Object 5 and Object 4.  The key is that Surface 0 is a square, and I know where Object 4 and Object 5 currently reside. Object 5 is centered, and Object 4 is in a bottom-left corner.  Object 6 is roughly square-shaped too.
           
           My plan is to rotate Object 6 in a series of 10 equal steps (0 to 2*pi), generating candidate placements.  For each rotation angle, I'll calculate the AABB's width and height.  Then I'll generate a grid of potential `(x, y)` coordinates within the surface bounds, ensuring I'm also avoiding the existing objects' bounding boxes. I will need to refine these bounds based on the *current* rotation angle, which is important to remember.
           
           I'll iterate through each rotation angle, checking that the new AABB doesn't collide with the obstacles, using precise collision calculations (overlapping AABB on the X *and* Y axis).  Collision avoidance is paramount to the success of this plan.
           
           I will focus on placing the object in relatively clear spaces for a start. So on the surface bounds: right, top, and the diagonals. The algorithm will then check candidate points and reject the ones that are invalid. If I've calculated correctly, this strategy should provide many valid (stable) placements.
