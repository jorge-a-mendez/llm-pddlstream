(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I need to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 4) on surface 0, which is defined by the bounding box `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. The object's dimensions are `size_x = size_y = 0.0821533102067438`. Since this is the first request, I don't have to worry about collision with other objects.
           
           Because the object is square, its bounding box dimensions remain constant regardless of rotation.  So I'll just call the object's side length `s`, and its value is `0.0821533102067438`.  To ensure a stable placement, the object's center must be positioned such that its entire bounding box lies within the surface's bounding box.  This means its center `(x, y)` must satisfy some constraints.
           
           The surface's dimensions give us a width and height of 0.27, as well as the bounding coordinate ranges.
           
           Since `s/2 = 0.0410766551033719`, I can determine the valid range for `x` and `y` center coordinates.  For `x`, the range is  `[-0.0939233448966281, 0.0939233448966281]`.  And for `y` it is the same.  I'm going to make the names `x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max`.
           
           To generate 50 placements, I'll systematically vary the `x` and `y` coordinates. Because I'm working with a square object, rotation doesn't change the bounding box, but for the sake of diversity and good practice, I can still apply rotation.  I can divide the usable area into a grid, using some steps for x and y to create enough placements, since 7 * 7 is only 49.
           
           I'll use `theta = 0` for most of the placements and then `pi/4` (45 degrees) for one to ensure diversity.  So, I will divide the `x` and `y` ranges into 7 steps. Using 7 steps results in a step size of roughly 0.0313. I'll use those x and y coords.
           
           To summarize, for the first 49 placements, I'll generate a grid of `(x, y)` values with `theta = 0`.  Then for the 50th placement, I'll use `theta = pi/4` and position it at `(0, 0)`.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Object Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan for placing Object 5, avoiding collisions with the previously placed Object 4, within the surface bounds:
           
           *   **Understanding the Setup:** We know Object 4's location, the surface's dimensions, and the size of Object 5. Both are effectively square, making AABB calculations straightforward.
           *   **Collision Avoidance:** We define a collision "forbidden zone" within the surface where Object 5's center cannot be. This zone is determined by the AABB of Object 4, expanded by Object 5's half-extent. Essentially, Object 5 must not be *too* close to Object 4.
           *   **Surface Boundaries:** Object 5's center must be within the surface's limits, taking its own size (half-extents) into account.
           *   **Grid-Based Placement with Collision Filtering:** We'll use a 7x7 grid to generate 49 candidate center locations. We calculate x-coord and y-coord and for each grid point. We will check each grid point's coordinate pair. If the grid point's `x` and `y` are both within the forbidden collision zone, we skip it.
           *   **Additional placements:** For variety, we'll assign `theta = 0`. For 10 more placements, we'll assign a rotation of `pi/4` (45 degrees) for those points outside of the collision-prone locations.
           
           This systematic approach ensures we generate many valid, non-colliding placements for Object 5.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan for placing Object 6 on Surface 0:**
           
           I need to position Object 6, ensuring it's stable and avoids collisions with Object 4 and Object 5. First, I calculated the permissible area on Surface 0, taking into account Object 6's size.  I determined that Object 6's center must stay within a specific rectangular zone to be stable.
           
           Next, I analyzed the bounding boxes of Object 4 and Object 5 to identify collision-free zones. I precisely calculated the boundaries where Object 6 could *not* be placed to avoid overlap. These zones depend on the relative positions and sizes of the existing objects.
           
           To find valid placements, I set up a grid of potential locations across Surface 0. I discarded grid points that fell within the forbidden collision zones calculated.  With the initial grid and filtered set of valid placement coordinates, I generated the valid placements. I considered two rotations, `0` and `pi/4`. I ended up with 31 positions for `theta = 0`, 16 positions at `theta = pi/4` and 3 positions for `theta = pi/2`, resulting in 50 distinct, collision-free placements.
