           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Path to Placement**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to get those objects where they need to be: `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`. Since I know that `on` means something is supported and in the right pose, I need to ensure each object is supported by `v16` and in an appropriate pose.
           
           Analyzing the initial state, I see that each object is currently sitting on `v11`. However, I also have the supporting facts: `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` *can* be supported by `v16` at pose `#o2`. Thus, the strategy emerges: pick each object up from its current pose and place it at `#o2` on `v16`.
           
           The actions are defined, and the robot base needs to be configured with the base at `#o3` to perform these actions. Therefore, it will need to move to `#o3` initially. The actions that work are the robot arm pick/place actions, plus the move base actions.
           
           Let's break it down:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  First, the robot's base moves to `#o3`.
           2.  **Pick:** Then, I'll pick up `v8` from its current location.
           3.  **Place:** Then, I'll place `v8` at `#o2` on `v16`.
           4.  **Pick:**  I'll pick up `v12` from its current location.
           5.  **Place:**  Then, I'll place `v12` at `#o2` on `v16`.
           6.  **Pick:** Then, I'll pick up `v14` from its current location.
           7.  **Place:** Then, I'll place `v14` at `#o2` on `v16`.
           
           Since each object's placement is independent, I could have reordered this to any order of pick-and-place for the three objects.  It just needs to be ensured that base is at #o3 beforehand.
