           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two objects, `v12` and `v15`, both of which are graspable and stackable. `v12` is currently at `v13` supported by `v14`, and `v15` is at `v16` supported by `v11`. The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both are handempty. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. From the initial state, `type(v12, v17)` is given. Also `stackable(v12, v18)` is given. This means that if we place `v12` on `v18`, the goal will be achieved. Currently, `v12` is on `v14` (via `supported(v12, v13, v14)` and `atpose(v12, v13)` which implies `on(v12, v14)`). We need to pick up `v12` from `v13` and place it on `v18` at pose `#o2`.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', #o3) is not satisfied!`. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

           The previous plan failed because `atbconf(#o3)` was not satisfied. Looking at the initial state, `bconf(#o3)` is true, but `atbconf(#o3)` is not. However, the action `move_base(#o3, #o3, #o0)` is available. This action's precondition is `atbconf(#o3)`, and its effect is `atbconf(#o3)`. This indicates that the base is already at configuration `#o3`, and `atbconf(#o3)` is implied by the system. Let's re-examine the problem.
           
           The initial state contains `bconf(#o3)`. The `move_base` action `(move_base #o3 #o3 #o0)` has `atbconf(#o3)` as a precondition. If `atbconf(#o3)` is not true initially, then `move_base` cannot be the first action. This implies that the initial `bconf(#o3)` implies `atbconf(#o3)`. Let's assume `atbconf(#o3)` is true based on `bconf(#o3)`.
           
           My previous error was in assuming the planner environment automatically handles `atbconf`. Since `atbconf(#o3)` is an explicit precondition for `pick` and `place` actions, and it's not explicitly in the initial state, it needs to be made true. However, `move_base` also has `atbconf(#o3)` as a precondition and `atbconf(#o3)` as an effect (when `q1` and `q2` are the same). This means that if `atbconf(#o3)` is not true initially, and `bconf(#o3)` is, there's a contradiction, or `bconf(#o3)` is not enough to imply `atbconf(#o3)`.
           
           Given `bconf(#o3)` in the initial state, and the existence of `(move_base #o3 #o3 #o0)`, it's most likely that the robot base is *at* configuration `#o3`. The problem statement says, "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is *false*." So `atbconf(#o3)` is false.
           
           This is a tricky situation. If `atbconf(#o3)` is false, then no `pick` or `place` action can be executed. Also, `move_base` cannot be executed since its precondition `atbconf(#o3)` would not be met. If this is the case, then the goal is unreachable.
           
           However, often in these types of problems, `bconf(X)` is meant to represent the current base configuration, making `atbconf(X)` true. If `atbconf(#o3)` is indeed false, and the `move_base` action requires `atbconf(#o3)` to be true, and also produces `atbconf(#o3)` as an effect, there seems to be no way to ever make `atbconf(#o3)` true.
           
           Let's assume there is an implicit `atbconf(#o3)` due to `bconf(#o3)` in the initial state, or that the system provides `atbconf(#o3)` to facilitate the first base movement. If `atbconf(#o3)` is indeed necessary and not implicitly true, then the goal is unreachable with the given actions. Given the presence of `bconf(#o3)` and a `move_base` action that essentially no-ops the base, this strongly suggests that the base is already at this configuration.
           
           Assuming `atbconf(#o3)` is true initially:
           1. `v12` is at `v13` (supported by `v14`).
           2. We need to move `v12` to `v18` at pose `#o2`.
           3. Action `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)` will pick `v12`.
           4. Action `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)` will place `v12` at the target location.
           
           If `atbconf(#o3)` is *not* true, and `move_base` cannot be used to make it true (because `q1` is `#o3` and thus `atbconf(#o3)` is a precondition), then the task is impossible. I will proceed under the assumption that the presence of `bconf(#o3)` in the initial state implies `atbconf(#o3)` for the purpose of planning the first action. If this interpretation is incorrect and `atbconf(#o3)` must be explicitly stated or achieved, then no plan is possible.
           
           --Plan--:
           (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', #o3) is not satisfied!`. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The initial state explicitly lists `bconf(#o3)` but not `atbconf(#o3)`. As per the problem statement, "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is *false*." Therefore, `atbconf(#o3)` is false.
           
           The `pick` action has `atbconf(#o3)` as a precondition. Since `atbconf(#o3)` is false, no `pick` action can be performed.
           The `place` action also has `atbconf(#o3)` as a precondition. Since `atbconf(#o3)` is false, no `place` action can be performed.
           The `move_base` action `(move_base #o3 #o3 #o0)` has `atbconf(#o3)` as a precondition. Since `atbconf(#o3)` is false, `move_base` cannot be performed either.
           
           This means that no actions that involve the base configuration `#o3` (which are all the `pick`, `place`, and `move_base` actions provided) can be executed. Without these actions, the robot cannot interact with the objects to achieve the goal of placing `v12` on `v18`.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable from the given initial state with the provided valid action instances.
