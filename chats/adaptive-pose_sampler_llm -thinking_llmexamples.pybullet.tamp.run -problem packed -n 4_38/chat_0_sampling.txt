(Thoughts: **Understanding Stable Placements for a Square Object**
           
           Okay, I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for an object (ID 7) on a square surface.  The object is a small square (dimensions: 0.0719391393124284 x 0.07193913931242846). The surface is a square from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  
           
           My goal here is to make sure I understand "stability". A stable placement means the object's bounding box is entirely within the surface's bounding box. Since the object is a square, its bounding box's dimensions change depending on its rotation (theta). The smallest bounding box is when the object is aligned with the axes. The maximum bounding box occurs at 45 degrees, where the rotated bounding box expands to `s * sqrt(2)`. Given the object's size and surface size, that maximum rotated box can still fit, so all rotations are valid.
           
           Therefore, for the object to remain stable, the center position must be calculated at any angle.
           
           I determined that to compute the maximum half-width and half-height for all potential rotations. Because it is square, the object's half extents are simply half the length, i.e., `sx/2` and `sy/2` when aligned with the axes. I also figured out the values of `hw_obj` and `hh_obj` by using the standard formula.
           
           The surface's available width and height for stable placement varies by angle.
           
           My strategy to generate those 50 placements is:
           
           1.  I start with a set of base angles: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, and pi/2. I'll then expand these theta values to include more angle values to have 50 unique placements in total.
           
           2.  For each angle (theta), calculate `hw_obj`, and `hh_obj` (the half-width and half-height of the rotated object).
           
           3.  Use `hw_obj` and `hh_obj` to determine a set of possible `x` and `y` locations that are valid for stability. I'm going to then test various points from (-0.135 + hw_obj, -0.135 + hh_obj) to (0.135 - hw_obj, 0.135 - hh_obj) or their scaled equivalents.
           
           I used a range of positions so that I can provide all angles that are valid.  I can then return the first 50 stable placements in the format `<surf_idx>, <theta>, <x>, <y>`.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: A Detailed Analysis**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with placing object 5 (ID 5) on surface 0, making sure it doesn't collide with the already-placed object 7.  The key is to determine valid and stable placements for the new object.
           
           First things first, I've got object 7's dimensions and location (essentially at the center, zero rotation).  I'll need this AABB.
           
           Now, for object 5, I've got its dimensions, and I'll need to figure out its AABB for different rotations. I know that since the surface bounds are well-defined, I can calculate valid placement regions on surface 0 for object 5, and I'll consider it's dimensions, plus it's potential rotations. I plan to rotate by pi/8 increment and check. Then, I calculate the maximum and minimum coordinates of object 5's center for each theta.
           
           With this info, I can generate a grid of potential x and y coordinates for object 5 and check each placement for potential collisions with object 7. I'll need to calculate the *half-extents* of the square at each rotation.
           
           Here's how I'm approaching it:
           
           1.  **Define AABBs:** For both objects.
           2.  **Generate Candidates:** Create a set of placements (x, y, theta) for object 5.
           3.  **Collision Check:** For each placement, I'll calculate object 5's AABB.  I'll perform the collision check, checking for any overlap between object 5 and object 7.
           4.  **Filter:** I'll keep the first 50 stable, non-colliding placements.
           
           I'll check for the overlap of the object coordinates. I can see the area of the rectangle. With the rotations, it gets more complex.
           
           I'll generate coordinates to check the four corners, middle, and quarter points and do collision check for each.
           
           I will iterate through all possible rotations of object 5 and will perform the collision check in a systematic manner.

(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for a Square Object**
           
           Alright, I need to figure out where to place this new square object (ID 4) on the surface (surface 0) so that it's stable and doesn't bump into anything. Here's the situation:
           
           1.  **The Play Area:** The surface I'm working with is a rectangle defined by  `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           2.  **The Object (ID 4):**  It's a square with dimensions `(size_x = 0.09821653979831824, size_y = 0.09821653979831824)`.
           3.  **Obstacles:** There are two other objects on the surface that I need to avoid:
               *   Object 7: It's a square centered at (0,0), so I need to make sure my object doesn't overlap it.
               *   Object 5: It's also a square, and I need to avoid placing my object near it.
           
           **The Strategy:**
           
           To keep things simple, I'm going to only consider placing the object with rotations of 0 and 90 degrees. This keeps the math simpler. I'll focus on a grid-based approach to check placements.
           
           First, I need to figure out the valid range for the object's center based on its size and the surface boundaries. The "safe" areas are pretty narrow because of Object 7's position, it occupies a significant chunk of the surface space.  I calculate the minimum and maximum ranges for placing the object on each axis.
           Then, I define a grid of possible (x, y) coordinates for object 4's center, within the safe ranges. I calculate the AABB's for the object and each obstacle for a given coordinate. I'll need a collision-detection function that tells me if the AABB's overlap. If the new object's AABB overlaps with the AABB of object 7 or 5 at a grid point, I throw that point out.
           
           Because the new object is larger, it poses a challenge to find placements that don't collide with the obstacles. Also, the AABB of the rotated object expands and requires more space at the diagonals, and this further limits placement opportunities.  So, I will try to place the object near the valid edges to ensure the AABB doesn't collide with any object.
           Now I generate the possible placements and perform the collision checks, and I should be able to generate at least 50 valid placements.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing Placement Options for a New Object (ID 6)**
           
           My task is to find 50 stable positions for a new object (ID 6) on surface 0, taking into account existing obstacles. I need to be precise, as even tiny overlaps will invalidate a placement.
           
           **Obstacle AABB Review:**
           
           First, I examined the existing obstacles:
           
           *   Object 7: centered at (0,0), a small square.
           *   Object 5: Located in the bottom left, a square shape.
           *   Object 4: Positioned on the left, a medium square.
           
           The new object's shape is almost a square, which simplifies some rotation analysis. Its dimensions and surface boundaries were considered.
           
           **Rotation and Surface Containment:**
           
           I analyzed the space constraints for object 6, the new square. I determined its dimensions and half-extents. It turns out, that with a 45 degree rotation, its half-extents at theta=pi/4 will not fit due to object 7. I found that I will need to use theta = 0 or theta = pi/2.
           
           **Collision Detection and Constraints:**
           
           The heart of the challenge is avoiding collisions. I used the Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) approach for efficiency. For theta = 0, the object must avoid overlap with the existing obstacles. Specifically:
           
           *   Object 7 presents a central challenge. If object 6's center is within a certain distance from object 7's edge, I have an overlap. Object 6 can only placed close to the edges of the box, near the corners.
           *   Object 5 creates an obstacle in the bottom-left quadrant. This constraint meant some locations in the bottom-left are invalid.
           *   Object 4: This is the most crucial constraint. The center of Object 6 must stay to the right of the center of Object 4, to avoid overlaps.
           
           **Region Analysis and Placement Strategy:**
           
           I identified the available "safe" regions for placement:
           
           *   A thin strip along the top edge of my space.
           *   A thin strip along the bottom edge of my space.
           *   A thin strip along the right edge of my space.
           
           I will systematically scan these thin strips for potential placements, verifying for any remaining collision issues. By densely sampling the allowed zones, I aim to generate 50 valid placements. If I can't find 50, I'll increase the grid density.

           I identified the available "safe" regions for placement:
           
           *   A thin strip along the top edge of my space.
           *   A thin strip along the bottom edge of my space.
           *   A thin strip along the right edge of my space.
           
           I will systematically scan these thin strips for potential placements, verifying for any remaining collision issues. By densely sampling the allowed zones, I aim to generate 50 valid placements. If I can't find 50, I'll increase the grid density.
