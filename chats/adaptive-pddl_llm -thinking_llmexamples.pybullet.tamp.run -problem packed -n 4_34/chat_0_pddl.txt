           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Goal Achievability**
           
           My primary goal is to achieve the state where objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` are all `on` object `v18`.  Given the axiom `on(?o, ?r)  if supported(?o, ?p, ?r)  and atpose(?o, ?p)`, my initial thought is to identify a pose `p` for each object where it's both supported by `v18` and in the correct `atpose`.
           
           Examining the initial state, I see a clear path: all four objects are currently supported by `v11` at their respective poses, and there are facts that establish that moving them to pose `#o2` would make them supported by `v18`. So, my plan, ideally, would involve a series of `pick` and `place` actions to move each object to `#o2`.
           
           However, upon reviewing the available action instances, I only find `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. There are no `pick` or `place` actions.  Since the problem constraints state that I *can only use the given actions*, and `move_base` doesn't change the `atpose` of any object, I'm stuck. It's impossible to manipulate the object's poses to achieve the desired `on` relationships.
           
           Therefore, given the constraint of only using the provided actions, I conclude that the goal is unattainable.
