           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning: Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` all *on* object `v18`. Since I'm working with the `on` predicate, I know I'll be manipulating `supported` and `atpose` predicates. This means I'll need to use `pick` and `place` actions to move the objects.
           
           Looking at the initial state, those objects are currently *on* `v11`.  My plan is to *pick* each object from `v11` and *place* them on `v18`.
           
           The `kin` predicates indicate that the arm *can* pick and place each object. The key here is the *base* configuration `#o3` required for the `kin` predicates to work.  My initial state, however, is at `v3` and the only available action is a *move_base* action that *moves from v3 to v3*.
           
           The issue is this:  the robot's base can't actually move to the base configuration `#o3` required for picking and placing because the only move action keeps the base at `v3`. This is a hard constraint due to the "not allowed" rule on action instances.
           
           So, even though I have the kinematics for picking and placing, the preconditions for these actions are never met. The robot can never reach the necessary base configuration, making the `pick` and `place` actions impossible.  Consequently, I can't achieve the goal of having the objects on `v18`.
           
           Therefore, this goal is unreachable given the current action set and the specified constraints. It's a classical planning problem with an unresolvable precondition.
