           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **High-Level Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I've got a plan to move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) from their current locations on surface v11 to the target surface v20. The robot, with arms v4 and v6 (but I'm only using v4 because of kinematic constraints), needs to perform a series of `pick` and `place` actions for each object. The robot's base is fixed at bconf v3, and the arm starts at aconf v5. All objects are initially on surface v11.
           
           **Detailed Breakdown of the Approach**
           
           1.  **Object-by-Object Strategy:** For each object, the process will be:
               *   **Pick:** Use the `pick` action to grasp the object from its initial pose (e.g., v8 from pose v9). I'll use arm v4 for this.
               *   **Place:** Use the `place` action to put the object onto the target surface v20 at a specific pose. Since multiple objects are being placed on v20, I need a separate, collision-free target pose for each. I'm going to assign a unique `#o2` pose for each object on v20.
           2.  **Pose Considerations:**
               *   I need to create a pose on v20 for each object that is safe, and supported. These poses must not lead to collisions. I will define these poses, e.g. `#o2_v8`, `#o2_v12`, etc.
               *   All kinematic facts are defined for v4.
               *   Base location is fixed, so no base movement cost is incurred.
           
           **Action Sequence**
           The plan consists of a sequence of pick-and-place actions:
           
           1.  Pick v8 (from pose v9) and place it on surface v20.
           2.  Pick v12 (from pose v13) and place it on surface v20.
           3.  Pick v14 (from pose v15) and place it on surface v20.
           4.  Pick v16 (from pose v17) and place it on surface v20.
           5.  Pick v18 (from pose v19) and place it on surface v20.
           
           **Collision Avoidance**
           Since the base doesn't move and objects are relatively small, I've designed target poses that avoid any collisions on v20. I've placed the objects in such a way that they don't overlap within the bounds of v20.
           
           **Cost Evaluation**
           The plan's cost will be 10, considering a unit cost for each pick and each place operation (5 picks + 5 places).
           
           **Pose Details**
           The `kin` facts already include pose `#o2` for each object, even though a unique pose is required for each object. Based on the problem description, I'll use `#o2` throughout the plan and will specify the pose values for each instance as follows:
           
           *   For v8: `#o2_v8 = (0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)`
           *   For v12: `#o2_v12 = (-0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)`
           *   For v14: `#o2_v14 = (0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)`
           *   For v16: `#o2_v16 = (-0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)`
           *   For v18: `#o2_v18 = (0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)`
           
           These pose values are calculated to prevent objects from colliding with each other or the edges of surface v20, and all are set to a z value of 0.781, consistent with the initial conditions. These values are used in the place actions.
           
           The plan appears complete and ready for execution.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of the Task**
           
           Okay, so I've looked over the user's feedback, and it's pretty clear. My previous plan is toast. They're saying all my `pick` and `place` actions are invalid, as expected, given the ridiculous limitation on valid actions. The *only* action I'm allowed to use is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. Basically, I can *only* move the base from `v3` to `v3`, which... does absolutely nothing, especially since it has a zero cost.
           
           The goal is to get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` onto surface `v20`. The initial state shows they're all currently resting on `v11`.  My brain immediately goes to `pick` and `place` actions, which are the obvious moves here. But, since the system is refusing me anything besides this worthless move action, I'm completely hamstrung. I can't even *begin* to manipulate the environment to achieve the desired state.
           
           It's a classic example of an unreachable goal with such a limited action space. I need to explain the logical impossibility of this. The problem statement itself said I should not return a plan if the goal is unreachable.  I must explain why.
