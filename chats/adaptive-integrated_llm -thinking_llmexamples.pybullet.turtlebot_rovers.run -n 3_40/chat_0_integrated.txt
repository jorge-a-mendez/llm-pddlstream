           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunctive goal that hinges on securing images and analyses from specific objects.  We're given an initial state, and it looks like the initial state already satisfies some conditions: the rovers, v12 and v14, are at their starting configurations (v13 and v15, respectively), and they have free storage (v16).  However, the core challenge lies in the remaining predicates: getting images (from objects v17, v18, v19, to be seen by mode v11) and received analysis (for rocks v1, v3, v4 and soils v5, v7, v8).
           
           **Identifying Key Actions and Preconditions**
           
           To get these images and analyses, we need to leverage the available actions. The relevant actions include `send_image`, `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_analysis`, and `sample_rock`. Each of these actions has specific preconditions that need to be met. For example, to send an image (using `send_image`), we need communication visibility (`comvisible`), that the rover must have the image (`haveimage`), and the rover needs to be at the right configuration.
           
           Crucially, to get `haveimage` we have to use the `take_image` action, which requires `imagevisible`, `onboard`, `supports`, `atconf`, `calibrated`, and `~blocked`. This means the robot must have the camera ready and that the camera has been calibrated. In this instance, this depends on rover's location and what it can "see". This implies the rovers, `v12` and `v14` are at configurations.
           
           **Analyzing the Initial State and Discovering Incompatibilities**
           
           Now, the initial state becomes critical. We have the initial configurations: `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`. We also have the visible communications, objects that can be images or samples, and some relevant configurations. Here’s where the analysis becomes tricky. Looking closely, the communication and image visibility predicates are *not* defined for the current, `atconf` positions v13 or v15. They *are* defined for other configurations like `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`. But the only `move` actions available are basically no-ops, keeping the rovers where they are, specifically, `v12` will *always* be at v13 and `v14` will *always* be at v15.
           
           The prompt states I must provide a continuous value for the '#' configurations. It also states if there are sufficient configurations without '#' to solve the problem, you should use those configurations instead of any with '#'. Since `comvisible`, `imagevisible` and `above` predicates do not hold in v13 or v15, I would need to use '#' configurations, and provide a continuous value for these configurations. However, no move actions are available to go to them. Thus, my goal must be unreachable.
           
           **The Unsolvable Implication and Final Conclusion**
           
           Given that these key preconditions, like `imagevisible`, are only true for different, unreachable configurations, I cannot execute actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock` or `send_analysis`. Therefore, the essential goal predicates —`receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`— remain unattainable. Since the goal `new-axiom@0()` is defined as a conjunction involving these impossible predicates, it's inherently unsolvable. The constraints on available actions and the initial state, as given, lead to a dead end. Therefore, I can confirm that the goal is currently unreachable.
