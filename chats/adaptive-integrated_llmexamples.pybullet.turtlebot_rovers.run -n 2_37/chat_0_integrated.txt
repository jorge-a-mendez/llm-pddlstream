           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks us to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom with several conditions, including `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`. This means we need to image objectives v17 and v18 using mode v11, and send those images, and also analyze rocks of type 'stone' (v2) and 'soil' (v6) and send the analysis.
           
           Looking at the initial state:
           - Rover v12 is at configuration v13.
           - Rover v14 is at configuration v15.
           - Both rovers have camera v10 onboard, which supports mode v11.
           - Both rovers have store v16 free.
           - Objective v17 and v18 are present.
           - There are rocks of type v2 (stone) and v6 (soil):
               - Type v2 (stone): v3, v1, v4
               - Type v6 (soil): v5, v8, v7
           - Lander v9 is present for communication.
           
           Let's break down the `new-axiom@0()` goal:
           1. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
              - This requires `take_image` and then `send_image`.
              - `take_image(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o, ?c, ?m)` requires `imagevisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o)`, `onboard(?c, ?v)`, `supports(?c, ?m)`, `atconf(?v, ?q)`, `calibrated(?c, ?v)`.
              - `send_image(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l, ?o, ?m)` requires `comvisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l)`, `objective(?o)`, `mode(?m)`, `haveimage(?v, ?o, ?m)`, `atconf(?v, ?q)`.
              - We have `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`. This means both rovers can image both objectives at configuration `#o3`.
              - We also have `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`. This means both rovers can communicate with the lander at configuration `#o0`.
           
           2. `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for rocks of type v2 and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for rocks of type v6:
              - This requires `sample_rock` and then `send_analysis`.
              - `sample_rock(?v, ?q, ?r, ?s)` requires `above(?v, ?q, ?r)`, `store(?s)`, `atconf(?v, ?q)`, `free(?v, ?s)`.
              - `send_analysis(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l, ?r)` requires `comvisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l)`, `rock(?r)`, `analyzed(?v, ?r)`, `atconf(?v, ?q)`.
              - We have `above(v12, #o5, v7)` (soil), `above(v12, #o5, v4)` (stone), `above(v12, #o5, v5)` (soil), `above(v12, #o5, v3)` (stone), `above(v12, #o5, v8)` (soil), `above(v12, #o5, v1)` (stone). Rover v12 can sample all rock types at configuration `#o5`.
              - Similarly, rover v14 can also sample all rock types at configuration `#o5`.
           
           The current configuration of v12 is v13 and v14 is v15. We need to move the rovers to configurations `#o3` for imaging and `#o0` for sending, and `#o5` for sampling. The problem statement says that if `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state and `#<name>` is used in `imagevisible` or `comvisible`, we need to provide a value. Also, if a configuration starting with '#' for which `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state is not used in the plan, then we need not provide a value for it. Since we will use `#o3`, `#o4`, `#o0`, `#o1`, `#o5` we will need to provide values for those.
           
           Let's plan to use rover v12 for everything.
           
           **Step 1: Calibrate the camera for imaging.**
           To take an image, the camera needs to be calibrated. `calibrate` uses the `imagevisible` predicate. Rover v12 is at `v13`. It needs to move to `#o3` to image v17 and v18.
           Since `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` is true, we can calibrate `v10` on `v12` using `v18` at `#o3`.
           
           **Step 2: Take images of v17 and v18.**
           After calibrating, we can take images of v17 and v18 using camera v10 and mode v11.
           
           **Step 3: Send images of v17 and v18.**
           To send images, rover v12 needs to move to `#o0` (where `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` is true).
           
           **Step 4: Sample and analyze rocks.**
           To satisfy `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, we need to sample at least one rock of type v2 (stone) and one of type v6 (soil). Rover v12 can sample rocks at `#o5`. Let's pick `v4` (stone) and `v5` (soil).
           
           **Step 5: Send analysis of sampled rocks.**
           After sampling, we need to send the analysis. Rover v12 needs to be at `#o0` to communicate with the lander v9.
           
           We are given only two types of actions with '#' in the actions list:
           `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))`
           `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`
           This implies that `#o2` is a trajectory that allows the rover to move from its current config to itself. This doesn't help us move to `#o0`, `#o3`, or `#o5`. The initial state gives `conf(v12, v13)`, `conf(v12, #o5)`, `conf(v12, #o3)`, `conf(v12, #o0)`. This means these configurations are known.
           The problem statement says: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration". This implies that we can assume the rover is already at those configurations or can magically move to them without an explicit `move` action for the configurations with '#' if they are used as the second argument to `imagevisible` or `comvisible` directly. However, the standard PDDL interpretation requires explicit move actions. Given the provided `move` actions, it seems the only "moves" allowed are to the current configuration or from the current configuration to itself, which doesn't allow changing configurations for imaging or sampling.
           
           Let's re-read: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." This means we can *only* use the provided `move` actions, which are `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))` and `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`. These actions essentially do not change the rover's configuration. This means rover v12 can only be at v13 and rover v14 can only be at v15.
           
           If the rovers can only stay at their initial configurations (v13 for v12, v15 for v14), then we can only perform actions that are possible at those configurations.
           Let's check what can be done at `v13` (for v12) and `v15` (for v14):
           
           For `imagevisible` and `comvisible`, the `conf` argument is `#o3` or `#o0`, not `v13` or `v15`.
           For `above`, the `conf` argument is `#o5`, not `v13` or `v15`.
           
           This means that with the given allowed `move` actions, the rovers cannot reach the configurations required for imaging, communicating, or sampling.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the provided allowed actions.
           
           The goal is not achievable. The given `move` actions only allow the rovers to stay in their current configurations (v13 for v12 and v15 for v14). However, all predicates required for achieving the goal, such as `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above`, depend on the rovers being at different configurations (e.g., `#o3` for imaging, `#o0` for communication, and `#o5` for sampling). Since the rovers cannot move to these required configurations, they cannot perform the necessary actions to take images, send images, sample rocks, or send analysis.
