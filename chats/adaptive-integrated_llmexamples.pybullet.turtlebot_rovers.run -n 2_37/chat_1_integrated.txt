           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, both equipped with a camera `v10` that supports mode `v11`, and a store `v16`. There are several rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`) and objectives (`v17`, `v18`). There's also a lander `v9`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are true (which they are initially).
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true (which they are initially).
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)` are true.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` are true.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` are true.
           
           We need to achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`. This requires taking images of `v17` and `v18` with `v11` mode and then sending them. We also need to achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for rocks of type `v2` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for rocks of type `v6`. This requires sampling a rock of each type and then sending its analysis.
           
           Let's break down the plan:
           
           **For Images:**
           *   To get `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
               *   Rover `v12` or `v14` needs to be at a configuration where `v17` and `v18` are visible. `#o3` is a good candidate for this as it's imagevisible for both rovers to both objectives.
               *   The camera `v10` needs to be calibrated.
               *   Then, `take_image` can be performed.
               *   Finally, `send_image` needs to be performed from a configuration where the lander `v9` is visible. `#o0` is a good candidate for this as it's comvisible for both rovers to the lander.
           
           **For Analysis:**
           *   To get `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (type `v2`): We have rocks `v3`, `v4`, `v1` of type `v2`. We can sample any of them. Rover `v12` is above `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           *   To get `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (type `v6`): We have rocks `v5`, `v7`, `v8` of type `v6`. We can sample any of them. Rover `v12` is above `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           
           Let's use Rover `v12` for all tasks, as it has initial `atconf(v12, v13)` and can move to `#o3` (for imaging) and `#o5` (for sampling) and then to `#o0` (for sending data).
           
           1.  **Move to imaging configuration**: `v12` needs to move from `v13` to `#o3`.
           2.  **Calibrate camera**: Calibrate `v10` on `v12` for `v17` (or `v18`).
           3.  **Take images**: Take image of `v17` and `v18`.
           4.  **Move to sampling configuration**: `v12` needs to move from `#o3` to `#o5`.
           5.  **Sample rocks**: Sample a rock of type `v2` (e.g., `v3`) and a rock of type `v6` (e.g., `v5`).
           6.  **Move to communication configuration**: `v12` needs to move from `#o5` to `#o0`.
           7.  **Send images**: Send images of `v17` and `v18`.
           8.  **Send analysis**: Send analysis of the sampled rocks (`v3` and `v5`).
           
           The rover `v12` starts at `v13`. It needs to go to `#o3` for imaging, then to `#o5` for sampling, then to `#o0` for sending.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, both equipped with a camera `v10` that supports mode `v11`, and a store `v16`. There are several rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`) and objectives (`v17`, `v18`). There's also a lander `v9`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are true (which they are initially).
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true (which they are initially).
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)` are true.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` are true.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` are true.
           
           We need to achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`. This requires taking images of `v17` and `v18` with `v11` mode and then sending them. We also need to achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for rocks of type `v2` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for rocks of type `v6`. This requires sampling a rock of each type and then sending its analysis.
           
           Let's break down the plan:
           
           **For Images:**
           *   To get `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
               *   Rover `v12` or `v14` needs to be at a configuration where `v17` and `v18` are visible. `#o3` is a good candidate for this as it's imagevisible for both rovers to both objectives.
               *   The camera `v10` needs to be calibrated.
               *   Then, `take_image` can be performed.
               *   Finally, `send_image` needs to be performed from a configuration where the lander `v9` is visible. `#o0` is a good candidate for this as it's comvisible for both rovers to the lander.
           
           **For Analysis:**
           *   To get `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (type `v2`): We have rocks `v3`, `v4`, `v1` of type `v2`. We can sample any of them. Rover `v12` is above `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           *   To get `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (type `v6`): We have rocks `v5`, `v7`, `v8` of type `v6`. We can sample any of them. Rover `v12` is above `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           
           Let's use Rover `v12` for all tasks, as it has initial `atconf(v12, v13)` and can move to `#o3` (for imaging) and `#o5` (for sampling) and then to `#o0` (for sending data).
           
           1.  **Move to imaging configuration**: `v12` needs to move from `v13` to `#o3`.
           2.  **Calibrate camera**: Calibrate `v10` on `v12` for `v17` (or `v18`).
           3.  **Take images**: Take image of `v17` and `v18`.
           4.  **Move to sampling configuration**: `v12` needs to move from `#o3` to `#o5`.
           5.  **Sample rocks**: Sample a rock of type `v2` (e.g., `v3`) and a rock of type `v6` (e.g., `v5`).
           6.  **Move to communication configuration**: `v12` needs to move from `#o5` to `#o0`.
           7.  **Send images**: Send images of `v17` and `v18`.
           8.  **Send analysis**: Send analysis of the sampled rocks (`v3` and `v5`).
           
           The rover `v12` starts at `v13`. It needs to go to `#o3` for imaging, then to `#o5` for sampling, then to `#o0` for sending.

However, the previous `#o3` configuration was in collision. We need to find new collision-free configurations for imaging `v17` and `v18`.
               *   The camera `v10` needs to be calibrated.
               *   Then, `take_image` can be performed.

           Let's use Rover `v12` for all tasks, as it has initial `atconf(v12, v13)` and can move to imaging, sampling and sending configurations.
           
           **Revised Configurations (to avoid collisions):**
           *   For imaging `v17` (AABB: ((-0.349, 1.768), (-0.254, 1.863))) with `v12`: Try a configuration slightly to the side or front/back of `v17`, avoiding `v19` (long thin obstacle at x=0) and `v20` (block at (-0.75, 1.75) to (-0.25, 2.25)). Let's try `(-0.5, 1.7)`. This is within 2 units of `v17`.
           *   For imaging `v18` (AABB: ((0.466, 1.759), (0.555, 1.849))) with `v12`: Try a configuration slightly to the side or front/back of `v18`, avoiding `v19` and `v21` (block at (0.25, 1.75) to (0.75, 2.25)). Let's try `(0.7, 1.7)`. This is within 2 units of `v18`.
           *   For communicating with `v9` (AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))) with `v12`: The previous config was inside `v9`. We need to be outside `v9` but within 4 units. Let's try `(-1.0, -1.0)`.
           
           **Plan Steps:**
           1.  **Move to first imaging configuration**: `v12` from `v13` to `#o3_17` (new config for `v17`).
           2.  **Calibrate camera**: Calibrate `v10` on `v12` for `v17`.
           3.  **Take image of v17**.
           4.  **Move to second imaging configuration**: `v12` from `#o3_17` to `#o3_18` (new config for `v18`).
           5.  **Calibrate camera**: Calibrate `v10` on `v12` for `v18` (camera was uncalibrated after taking the image of v17).
           6.  **Take image of v18**.
           7.  **Move to sampling configuration**: `v12` from `#o3_18` to `#o5`.
           8.  **Sample rocks**: Sample a rock of type `v2` (e.g., `v3`) and a rock of type `v6` (e.g., `v5`).
           9.  **Move to communication configuration**: `v12` from `#o5` to `#o0_comm`.
           10. **Send images**: Send images of `v17` and `v18`.
           11. **Send analysis**: Send analysis of the sampled rocks (`v3` and `v5`).

           **Revised Configurations (to avoid collisions and ensure reachability):**
           *   **For imaging `v17` (AABB: ((-0.349, 1.768), (-0.254, 1.863))) with `v12`**: Obstacles `v19` (long thin obstacle at x=0) and `v20` (block at (-0.75, 1.75) to (-0.25, 2.25)). Rover `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. We need to be within 2 units of `v17`. A configuration like `(-0.1, 1.5)` might be good, but `v19` is at x=0. So we need to be clear of x=0. `(-0.4, 1.5)` is still in collision with `v20`. Let's try to get further away from `v20` but still have line of sight. `(-0.9, 1.7)` might work.
           *   **For imaging `v18` (AABB: ((0.466, 1.759), (0.555, 1.849))) with `v12`**: Obstacles `v19` and `v21` (block at (0.25, 1.75) to (0.75, 2.25)). Rover `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. We need to be within 2 units of `v18`. Let's try `(0.1, 1.5)`. This avoids `v19` and `v21`.
           *   **For communicating with `v9` (AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))) with `v12`**: The previous config `(-1.0, -1.0)` was not reachable. The rover `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`. We need a point within 4 units of `v9` and reachable from `v12`'s current position and subsequent positions. A configuration close to `v9` but not inside it, for example `(-1.5, -1.5)`. This is a bit far from `v12`'s usual operation area, but if it is reachable, then it could work. Let's try a point that is more central but still has line of sight to `v9`. For instance, `(-0.5, -1.8)`. This is within 4 units of `v9`.
           
           **Plan Steps:**
           1.  **Move to first imaging configuration**: `v12` from `v13` to `#o3_17` (new config for `v17`).
           2.  **Calibrate camera**: Calibrate `v10` on `v12` for `v17`.
           3.  **Take image of v17**.
           4.  **Move to second imaging configuration**: `v12` from `#o3_17` to `#o3_18` (new config for `v18`).
           5.  **Calibrate camera**: Calibrate `v10` on `v12` for `v18` (camera was uncalibrated after taking the image of v17).
           6.  **Take image of v18**.
           7.  **Move to sampling configuration**: `v12` from `#o3_18` to `#o5`.
           8.  **Sample rocks**: Sample a rock of type `v2` (e.g., `v3`) and a rock of type `v6` (e.g., `v5`).
           9.  **Move to communication configuration**: `v12` from `#o5` to `#o0_comm`.
           10. **Send images**: Send images of `v17` and `v18`.
           11. **Send analysis**: Send analysis of the sampled rocks (`v3` and `v5`).

           Configuration #o0 = (-0.5 -1.8) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, both equipped with a camera `v10` that supports mode `v11`, and a store `v16`. There are several rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`) and objectives (`v17`, `v18`). There's also a lander `v9`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are true (which they are initially).
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true (which they are initially).
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)` are true.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` are true.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` are true.
           
           We need to achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`. This requires taking images of `v17` and `v18` with `v11` mode and then sending them. We also need to achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for rocks of type `v2` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for rocks of type `v6`. This requires sampling a rock of each type and then sending its analysis.
           
           Let's break down the plan:
           
           **For Images:**
           *   To get `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
               *   Rover `v12` or `v14` needs to be at a configuration where `v17` and `v18` are visible. We need new collision-free and reachable configurations for imaging `v17` and `v18`.
               *   The camera `v10` needs to be calibrated.
               *   Then, `take_image` can be performed.
               *   Finally, `send_image` needs to be performed from a configuration where the lander `v9` is visible. We need a new collision-free and reachable configuration for communication.
           
           **For Analysis:**
           *   To get `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (type `v2`): We have rocks `v3`, `v4`, `v1` of type `v2`. We can sample any of them. Rover `v12` is above `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           *   To get `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (type `v6`): We have rocks `v5`, `v7`, `v8` of type `v6`. We can sample any of them. Rover `v12` is above `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           
           Let's use Rover `v12` for all tasks, as it has initial `atconf(v12, v13)` and can move to imaging, sampling and sending configurations.
           
           **Revised Configurations (to avoid collisions and ensure reachability):**
           *   **For imaging `v17` (AABB: ((-0.349, 1.768), (-0.254, 1.863))) with `v12`**: Obstacles `v19` (x=0) and `v20` (block at (-0.75, 1.75) to (-0.25, 2.25)). Rover `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. We need to be within 2 units of `v17`. To avoid `v20`, we need to be either x < -0.75 or x > -0.25. Let's try to get further right, e.g. `(0.1, 1.7)`. This is clear of `v20`. However, `v19` (x=0.0) is a problem. Let's try `(-0.15, 1.6)`. This avoids `v19` and `v20`.
           *   **For imaging `v18` (AABB: ((0.466, 1.759), (0.555, 1.849))) with `v12`**: Obstacles `v19` (x=0) and `v21` (block at (0.25, 1.75) to (0.75, 2.25)). Rover `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. We need to be within 2 units of `v18`. To avoid `v21`, we need to be either x < 0.25 or x > 0.75. Let's try `(0.8, 1.7)`. This avoids `v21`.
           *   **For communicating with `v9` (AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))) with `v12`**: `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. We need a point within 4 units of `v9` and reachable. `(-0.5, -1.8)` was not reachable. Let's try `(0.0, -1.8)`. This might be reachable and offers a line of sight to `v9` while avoiding `v19` if we assume some width to the rover. The `v19` obstacle has an extent from -0.05 to 0.05 in x. So a config at x=0.0 would collide. Let's try `(0.1, -1.8)`. This seems plausible.
           
           **Plan Steps:**
           1.  **Move to first imaging configuration**: `v12` from `v13` to `#o3_17` (new config for `v17`).
           2.  **Calibrate camera**: Calibrate `v10` on `v12` for `v17`.
           3.  **Take image of v17**.

           5.  **Calibrate camera**: Calibrate `v10` on `v12` for `v18` (camera was uncalibrated after taking the image of v17).
           6.  **Take image of v18**.
           7.  **Move to sampling configuration**: `v12` from `#o3_18` to `#o5`.
           8.  **Sample rocks**: Sample a rock of type `v2` (e.g., `v3`) and a rock of type `v6` (e.g., `v5`).
           9.  **Move to communication configuration**: `v12` from `#o5` to `#o0_comm`.
           10. **Send images**: Send images of `v17` and `v18`.
           11. **Send analysis**: Send analysis of the sampled rocks (`v3` and `v5`).

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, both equipped with a camera `v10` that supports mode `v11`, and a store `v16`. There are several rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`) and objectives (`v17`, `v18`). There's also a lander `v9`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are true (which they are initially).
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true (which they are initially).
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)` are true.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` are true.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` are true.
           
           We need to achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`. This requires taking images of `v17` and `v18` with `v11` mode and then sending them. We also need to achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for rocks of type `v2` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for rocks of type `v6`. This requires sampling a rock of each type and then sending its analysis.
           
           Let's break down the plan:
           
           **For Images:**
           *   To get `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
               *   Rover `v12` or `v14` needs to be at a configuration where `v17` and `v18` are visible. We need new collision-free and reachable configurations for imaging `v17` and `v18`.
               *   The camera `v10` needs to be calibrated.
               *   Then, `take_image` can be performed.
               *   Finally, `send_image` needs to be performed from a configuration where the lander `v9` is visible. We need a new collision-free and reachable configuration for communication.
           
           **For Analysis:**
           *   To get `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (type `v2`): We have rocks `v3`, `v4`, `v1` of type `v2`. We can sample any of them. Rover `v12` is above `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           *   To get `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (type `v6`): We have rocks `v5`, `v7`, `v8` of type `v6`. We can sample any of them. Rover `v12` is above `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           
           Let's use Rover `v12` for all tasks, as it has initial `atconf(v12, v13)` and can move to imaging, sampling and sending configurations.
           
           **Revised Configurations (to avoid collisions and ensure reachability):**
           *   **For imaging `v17` (AABB: ((-0.349, 1.768), (-0.254, 1.863))) with `v12`**: Obstacles `v19` (x=(-0.05, 0.05)) and `v20` (block at (-0.75, 1.75) to (-0.25, 2.25)). Rover `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. We need to be within 2 units of `v17`. To avoid `v20`, we need to be either x < -0.75 or x > -0.25. And for `v19`, x < -0.05 or x > 0.05. Let's try `(-1.0, 1.7)`. This is clear of both `v19` and `v20`.
           *   **For imaging `v18` (AABB: ((0.466, 1.759), (0.555, 1.849))) with `v12`**: Obstacles `v19` (x=(-0.05, 0.05)) and `v21` (block at (0.25, 1.75) to (0.75, 2.25)). Rover `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. We need to be within 2 units of `v18`. To avoid `v21`, we need to be either x < 0.25 or x > 0.75. And for `v19`, x < -0.05 or x > 0.05. Let's try `(0.1, 1.7)`. This configuration is still colliding with `v19`. Let's try `(0.8, 1.6)`. This avoids `v21` and `v19`.
           *   **For communicating with `v9` (AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))) with `v12`**: Obstacle `v19` (x=(-0.05, 0.05)). Rover `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. We need a point within 4 units of `v9` and reachable. Let's try `(-0.15, -1.9)`. This avoids `v19` and is reachable.
           
           **Plan Steps:**
           1.  **Move to first imaging configuration**: `v12` from `v13` to `#o3_17` (new config for `v17`).
           2.  **Calibrate camera**: Calibrate `v10` on `v12` for `v17`.
           3.  **Take image of v17**.
           4.  **Move to second imaging configuration**: `v12` from `#o3_17` to `#o3_18` (new config for `v18`).
           5.  **Calibrate camera**: Calibrate `v10` on `v12` for `v18` (camera was uncalibrated after taking the image of v17).
           6.  **Take image of v18**.
           7.  **Move to sampling configuration**: `v12` from `#o3_18` to `#o5`.
           8.  **Sample rocks**: Sample a rock of type `v2` (e.g., `v3`) and a rock of type `v6` (e.g., `v5`).
           9.  **Move to communication configuration**: `v12` from `#o5` to `#o0_comm`.
           10. **Send images**: Send images of `v17` and `v18`.
           11. **Send analysis**: Send analysis of the sampled rocks (`v3` and `v5`).

           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` are true.
           
           We need to achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`. This requires taking images of `v17` and `v18` with `v11` mode and then sending them.

           *   **For imaging `v17` (AABB: ((-0.349, 1.768), (-0.254, 1.863))) with `v12`**: Obstacles `v19` (x=(-0.05, 0.05)) and `v20` (block at (-0.75, 1.75) to (-0.25, 2.25)). Rover `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. We need to be within 2 units of `v17`. To avoid `v20`, we need to be either x < -0.75 or x > -0.25. For `v19`, x < -0.05 or x > 0.05. Let's try `(-0.1, 1.5)`. This avoids `v20` and `v19`.
           *   **For imaging `v18` (AABB: ((0.466, 1.759), (0.555, 1.849))) with `v12`**: Obstacles `v19` (x=(-0.05, 0.05)) and `v21` (block at (0.25, 1.75) to (0.75, 2.25)). Rover `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. We need to be within 2 units of `v18`. To avoid `v21`, we need to be either x < 0.25 or x > 0.75. For `v19`, x < -0.05 or x > 0.05. Let's try `(0.2, 1.5)`. This avoids `v21` and `v19`.
           *   **For communicating with `v9` (AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))) with `v12`**: Obstacle `v19` (x=(-0.05, 0.05)). Rover `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. We need a point within 4 units of `v9` and reachable. Let's try `(0.06, -1.9)`. This avoids `v19` and is reachable.
           
           **Plan Steps:**
           1.  **Move to first imaging configuration**: `v12` from `v13` to `#o3_17` (new config for `v17`).
           2.  **Calibrate camera**: Calibrate `v10` on `v12` for `v17`.
           3.  **Take image of v17**.
           4.  **Move to second imaging configuration**: `v12` from `#o3_17` to `#o3_18` (new config for `v18`).
           5.  **Calibrate camera**: Calibrate `v10` on `v12` for `v18` (camera was uncalibrated after taking the image of v17).
           6.  **Take image of v18**.
           7.  **Move to sampling configuration**: `v12` from `#o3_18` to `#o5`.
           8.  **Sample rocks**: Sample a rock of type `v2` (e.g., `v3`) and a rock of type `v6` (e.g., `v5`).
           9.  **Move to communication configuration**: `v12` from `#o5` to `#o0_comm`.
           10. **Send images**: Send images of `v17` and `v18`.
           11. **Send analysis**: Send analysis of the sampled rocks (`v3` and `v5`).

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, both equipped with a camera `v10` that supports mode `v11`, and a store `v16`. There are several rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`) and objectives (`v17`, `v18`). There's also a lander `v9`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are true (which they are initially).
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true (which they are initially).
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)` are true.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` are true.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` are true.
           
           We need to achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`. This requires taking images of `v17` and `v18` with `v11` mode and then sending them. We also need to achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for rocks of type `v2` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for rocks of type `v6`. This requires sampling a rock of each type and then sending its analysis.
           
           Let's break down the plan:
           
           **For Images:**
           *   To get `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
               *   Rover `v12` or `v14` needs to be at a configuration where `v17` and `v18` are visible. We need new collision-free and reachable configurations for imaging `v17` and `v18`.
               *   The camera `v10` needs to be calibrated.
               *   Then, `take_image` can be performed.
               *   Finally, `send_image` needs to be performed from a configuration where the lander `v9` is visible. We need a new collision-free and reachable configuration for communication.
           
           **For Analysis:**
           *   To get `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (type `v2`): We have rocks `v3`, `v4`, `v1` of type `v2`. We can sample any of them. Rover `v12` is above `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           *   To get `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (type `v6`): We have rocks `v5`, `v7`, `v8` of type `v6`. We can sample any of them. Rover `v12` is above `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           
           Let's use Rover `v12` for all tasks, as it has initial `atconf(v12, v13)` and can move to imaging, sampling and sending configurations.

Rover `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. We need to be within 2 units of `v17`. To avoid `v20`, we need to be either x < -0.75 or x > -0.25. For `v19`, x < -0.05 or x > 0.05. Let's try `(-0.2, 1.4)`. This avoids `v19` and `v20`.
           *   **For imaging `v18` (AABB: ((0.466, 1.759), (0.555, 1.849))) with `v12`**: Obstacles `v19` (x=(-0.05, 0.05)) and `v21` (block at (0.25, 1.75) to (0.75, 2.25)). Rover `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. We need to be within 2 units of `v18`. To avoid `v21`, we need to be either x < 0.25 or x > 0.75. For `v19`, x < -0.05 or x > 0.05. Let's try `(0.8, 1.4)`. This avoids `v21` and `v19`.
           *   **For communicating with `v9` (AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))) with `v12`**: Obstacle `v19` (x=(-0.05, 0.05)). Rover `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. We need a point within 4 units of `v9` and reachable. Let's try `(-0.06, -1.9)`. This avoids `v19` and is reachable.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, both equipped with a camera `v10` that supports mode `v11`, and a store `v16`. There are several rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`) and objectives (`v17`, `v18`). There's also a lander `v9`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are true (which they are initially).
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true (which they are initially).
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)` are true.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` are true.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` are true.
           
           We need to achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`. This requires taking images of `v17` and `v18` with `v11` mode and then sending them. We also need to achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for rocks of type `v2` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for rocks of type `v6`. This requires sampling a rock of each type and then sending its analysis.
           
           Let's break down the plan:
           
           **For Images:**
           *   To get `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
               *   Rover `v12` or `v14` needs to be at a configuration where `v17` and `v18` are visible. We need new collision-free and reachable configurations for imaging `v17` and `v18`.
               *   The camera `v10` needs to be calibrated.
               *   Then, `take_image` can be performed.
               *   Finally, `send_image` needs to be performed from a configuration where the lander `v9` is visible. We need a new collision-free and reachable configuration for communication.
           
           **For Analysis:**
           *   To get `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (type `v2`): We have rocks `v3`, `v4`, `v1` of type `v2`. We can sample any of them. Rover `v12` is above `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           *   To get `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (type `v6`): We have rocks `v5`, `v7`, `v8` of type `v6`. We can sample any of them. Rover `v12` is above `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           
           Let's use Rover `v12` for all tasks, as it has initial `atconf(v12, v13)` and can move to imaging, sampling and sending configurations.
           
           **Revised Configurations (to avoid collisions and ensure reachability):**
           *   **For imaging `v17` (AABB: ((-0.349, 1.768), (-0.254, 1.863))) with `v12`**: Obstacles `v19` (x=(-0.05, 0.05)) and `v20` (block at (-0.75, 1.75) to (-0.25, 2.25)). Rover `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. We need to be within 2 units of `v17`. To avoid `v20`, we need to be either x < -0.75 or x > -0.25. For `v19`, x < -0.05 or x > 0.05. Let's try `(-0.06, 1.3)`. This avoids `v20` and `v19`.
           *   **For imaging `v18` (AABB: ((0.466, 1.759), (0.555, 1.849))) with `v12`**: Obstacles `v19` (x=(-0.05, 0.05)) and `v21` (block at (0.25, 1.75) to (0.75, 2.25)). Rover `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. We need to be within 2 units of `v18`. To avoid `v21`, we need to be either x < 0.25 or x > 0.75. For `v19`, x < -0.05 or x > 0.05. Let's try `(0.25, 1.3)`. This avoids `v19` and is on the edge of `v21`. Let's push it a bit further, `(0.2, 1.3)`. This avoids `v21` and `v19`.
           *   **For communicating with `v9` (AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))) with `v12`**: Obstacle `v19` (x=(-0.05, 0.05)). Rover `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. We need a point within 4 units of `v9` and reachable. Let's try `(-0.06, -2.0)`. This was in collision. Let's try `(0.1, -2.0)`. This avoids `v19` and is reachable.
           
           **Plan Steps:**
           1.  **Move to first imaging configuration**: `v12` from `v13` to `#o3_17` (new config for `v17`).
           2.  **Calibrate camera**: Calibrate `v10` on `v12` for `v17`.
           3.  **Take image of v17**.
           4.  **Move to second imaging configuration**: `v12` from `#o3_17` to `#o3_18` (new config for `v18`).
           5.  **Calibrate camera**: Calibrate `v10` on `v12` for `v18` (camera was uncalibrated after taking the image of v17).
           6.  **Take image of v18`.
           7.  **Move to sampling configuration**: `v12` from `#o3_18` to `#o5`.
           8.  **Sample rocks**: Sample a rock of type `v2` (e.g., `v3`) and a rock of type `v6` (e.g., `v5`).
           9.  **Move to communication configuration**: `v12` from `#o5` to `#o0_comm`.
           10. **Send images**: Send images of `v17` and `v18`.
           11. **Send analysis**: Send analysis of the sampled rocks (`v3` and `v5`).

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, both equipped with a camera `v10` that supports mode `v11`, and a store `v16`. There are several rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`) and objectives (`v17`, `v18`). There's also a lander `v9`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are true (which they are initially).
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true (which they are initially).
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)` are true.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` are true.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` are true.
           
           We need to achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`. This requires taking images of `v17` and `v18` with `v11` mode and then sending them. We also need to achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for rocks of type `v2` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for rocks of type `v6`. This requires sampling a rock of each type and then sending its analysis.
           
           Let's break down the plan:
           
           **For Images:**
           *   To get `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
               *   Rover `v12` or `v14` needs to be at a configuration where `v17` and `v18` are visible. We need new collision-free and reachable configurations for imaging `v17` and `v18`.
               *   The camera `v10` needs to be calibrated.
               *   Then, `take_image` can be performed.
               *   Finally, `send_image` needs to be performed from a configuration where the lander `v9` is visible. We need a new collision-free and reachable configuration for communication.
           
           **For Analysis:**
           *   To get `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (type `v2`): We have rocks `v3`, `v4`, `v1` of type `v2`. We can sample any of them. Rover `v12` is above `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           *   To get `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (type `v6`): We have rocks `v5`, `v7`, `v8` of type `v6`. We can sample any of them. Rover `v12` is above `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           
           Given the persistent collisions with `v19` at x=(-0.05, 0.05), it seems difficult to find configurations for `v12` that are not in collision with this obstacle along the x-axis, especially when targets `v17` and `v18` are quite central and `v19` extends through the middle of the scene. The rover `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`. Let's explore options for Rover `v14` as it starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`, which might give it a better chance to avoid `v19` on the left side of the scene.
           
           Let's try to use `v14` for imaging and communication.
           *   **For imaging `v17` (AABB: ((-0.349, 1.768), (-0.254, 1.863))) with `v14`**: Rover `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. We need to be within 2 units of `v17`. Avoiding `v19` (x=(-0.05, 0.05)) and `v20` (block at (-0.75, 1.75) to (-0.25, 2.25)). Let's try `(-0.9, 1.6)`. This avoids `v19` and `v20`.
           *   **For imaging `v18` (AABB: ((0.466, 1.759), (0.555, 1.849))) with `v14`**: Rover `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. We need to be within 2 units of `v18`. Avoiding `v19` (x=(-0.05, 0.05)) and `v21` (block at (0.25, 1.75) to (0.75, 2.25)). Let's try `(0.1, 1.6)`. This avoids `v19` and `v21`.
           *   **For communicating with `v9` (AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))) with `v14`**: Rover `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. `v9` is at `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`. Let's try a point near `v9` but not in collision, for example `(-1.2, -1.0)`. This should be reachable for `v14` and within 4 units of `v9`.
           
           We can still use `v12` for sampling as it is initially above a few rocks at `#o5`.
           
           **Plan Steps:**
           1.  **Move v14 to first imaging configuration**: `v14` from `v15` to `#o3_17_v14`.
           2.  **Calibrate camera (v14)**: Calibrate `v10` on `v14` for `v17`.
           3.  **Take image of v17 (v14)**.
           4.  **Move v14 to second imaging configuration**: `v14` from `#o3_17_v14` to `#o3_18_v14`.
           5.  **Calibrate camera (v14)**: Calibrate `v10` on `v14` for `v18`.
           6.  **Take image of v18 (v14)**.
           7.  **Move v14 to communication configuration**: `v14` from `#o3_18_v14` to `#o0_comm_v14`.
           8.  **Send images (v14)**: Send images of `v17` and `v18`.
           9.  **Move v12 to sampling configuration**: `v12` from `v13` to `#o5`.
           10. **Sample rocks (v12)**: Sample a rock of type `v2` (e.g., `v3`) and a rock of type `v6` (e.g., `v5`).
           11. **Move v12 to communication configuration**: `v12` from `#o5` to `#o0_comm_v12`. (We need a different comm config for v12, let's use a safe one like `(0.5, -1.5)`. This is further from v19 and reachable.)
           12. **Send analysis (v12)**: Send analysis of the sampled rocks (`v3` and `v5`).

           We've tried various configurations with `v12` and `v14` and keep running into collision or reachability issues, primarily with `v19` (the long thin obstacle at x=(-0.05, 0.05)) and objects around the objectives (`v20`, `v21`, `v22`). The `lander v9` is also quite an obstacle.
           
           It seems the problem lies in finding collision-free and reachable configurations *for the rover base* that also provide line-of-sight for imaging and communication. Given the density of obstacles and the limited workspace, it's becoming very difficult to find such configurations.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the initial state and valid actions, especially with respect to the `motion` predicates. The `motion` predicates are given for several configurations, including `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`. If these configurations themselves are problematic for reachability, then the problem is inherently difficult.
           
           Let's assume that the problem *is* solvable and there exist reachable, collision-free, and occlusion-free configurations. The repeated failure to find such configurations suggests a fundamental issue with the environment or the problem's constraints.
           
           Given the continuous failures to find a valid set of configurations, it is highly likely that the goal is not achievable given the current scene geometry and available action instances/motions.
           
           For example, all the proposed `#o3` configurations for `v12` and `v14` for imaging `v17` and `v18` are either in collision with `v19`, `v20`, `v21`, `v22` or are not reachable. The obstacles `v20` (upper=(-0.25, 2.25)), `v17` (upper=(-0.254, 1.863)), `v21` (lower=(0.25, 1.75)), `v18` (lower=(0.466, 1.759)) and `v19` (x-range=(-0.05, 0.05)) essentially create a narrow channel that is very hard for a rover to navigate and perform imaging tasks while avoiding collisions. Similarly, the communication configurations are repeatedly colliding with `v19` or are not reachable.
           
           Since I cannot find a sequence of actions with valid continuous values that avoids collision, maintains line of sight, and is reachable, I will conclude that the goal is not achievable.
