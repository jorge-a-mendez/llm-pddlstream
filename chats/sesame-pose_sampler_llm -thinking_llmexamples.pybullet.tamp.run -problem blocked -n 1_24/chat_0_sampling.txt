(Thoughts: **Placing the object with stability and diversity**
           
           Okay, I've got the task laid out. I need to find 50 stable placements for object 5 on surface 0.  I know the object is square (0.07 x 0.07) and surface 0 is a rectangle defined by the points (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0).  A stable placement means the object is *fully* inside the surface.
           
           I've broken this down: first, the object's center must be within a smaller rectangle inside the surface. For theta = 0 or 90 degrees, the allowed center coordinates are: `4.235 <= x <= 4.765` and `-0.565 <= y <= -0.035`. I can vary `x`, `y`, and the rotation angle (theta) to get a variety of placements.
           
           I'll start with mostly theta = 0 (0 degrees, or straight) and a few theta = pi/2 (90 degrees). I can show a variety of the placements using a grid approach, then introduce the need for a range reduction when using other theta values. To add diversity, I will use some `pi/4` (45 degrees) placements, which requires a smaller safe area due to the rotation. The formulas confirm the constraints. For `theta = pi/4`, it shrinks slightly to `x_range: [4.249497, 4.750502]` and `y_range: [-0.550503, -0.049497]`.
           
           First, I create a grid of points within the larger safe rectangle (0 degree rotation).  I'll space the points by around 0.065 to get a good spread, resulting in 40 placements, and for the next 5, I will rotate the object to 90 degrees, and for the final 5 placements, I'll use 45 degrees, and adjust x, and y values as needed. I'll make sure to use enough significant figures in the calculations, and that the coordinates cover the areas with stability.
           Here's the planned placement coordinates, surface_idx = 0:
           
           (0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565)

(Thoughts: **My plan for placing Object 10, given the constraints:**
           
           I need to place object ID 10 (a square, side length roughly 0.08) onto surface ID 0 while avoiding collisions with object ID 5, which is already in the scene. I know the successful placement coordinates for object ID 5.
           
           First, I'll analyze the space for object 10: I calculate its half-side length (`half_S = 0.04`). Then, I calculate the available center coordinates based on surface dimensions for different rotations (0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2, and pi/4)
           
           I have to consider existing objects.
           
           I know the successful placements for object ID 5 have a center y of -0.565, and -0.50. I'll need to calculate the bounding boxes for each of those placement centers. I'm going to determine which locations are "safe" (no collision) based on those bounds.  I'll start by filling the "safe" upper region of the surface, as object 5s are primarily in the lower-left.
           
           I will then use the x-range for object 10 as [4.2397, 4.7603].
           
           I calculate a suitable y to avoid overlapping object 5s.
           
           1.  **Placement Strategy:** I'll first try to fill the "safe" upper region (y >= -0.4253, and y < 0.0) with object 10 set to theta = 0.
               1.  I'll use a x-step of 0.08 and a y-step of 0.08, slightly more than the side-length (`S`) to ensure non-collision.
           2.  I then create the remaining placements.
           
               *   For the theta=0 placements, x locations [4.2397, 4.3197, 4.3997, 4.4797, 4.5597, 4.6397, 4.7197] and y locations [-0.4253, -0.3453, -0.2653, -0.1853, -0.1053]
               *   For theta=pi/2 locations use:
                   *   x locations [4.2397, 4.3297, 4.4197, 4.5097, 4.5997].
                   *   y locations [-0.0397, -0.1297].
               *   For the pi/4 placement, I set the locations:
                   *   x locations: [4.2562, 4.3562, 4.4562, 4.5562, 4.6562]
                   *   y locations: [-0.3588]
           
           I will then perform collision checks. By placing with these coordinates, I can ensure that all fifty placements will not overlap with existing objects.
