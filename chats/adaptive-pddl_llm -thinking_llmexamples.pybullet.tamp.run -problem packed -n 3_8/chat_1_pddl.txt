           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Plan**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The core of the problem is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all stacked on top of `v16`.  I know that to get them `on(?o, ?r)`, I need `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`. So, the target pose, `#o2`, is critical.
           
           Looking at the initial state, I see the positions of the objects, all initially `on(v11)`.  The graspable objects are `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, all available for manipulation. I have `kin` facts, which tells me the arm configurations and possible poses for the pick-and-place operation, so the robot arm can clearly interact with the objects.
           
           However, here's the kicker: The only available action instance I'm given is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  That's just moving the base from `v3` to `v3`, which is essentially a no-op! It doesn't allow me to pick up or place any objects.
           
           I carefully checked the requirements for `pick` and `place` actions; they need `kin`, `atpose`, `handempty`, `atbconf`, and safety checks. Those facts are present, but the *actions* themselves aren't. Given that the instructions clearly say I can *only* use the provided actions, I am completely hamstrung. I can't move the objects!
           
           I've re-read the problem statement, and it's crystal clear: I can only use `move_base`. Given that and the required final configuration, there is no plan.  The goal is unreachable with the given action set.  I must state that the goal cannot be achieved.
