(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My primary goal is to generate 50 unique, stable placements for an object (ID 5, with dimensions approximately 0.096 x 0.096) on a single surface (0:  ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))).  A placement consists of the surface index (always 0 here), a rotation angle (theta), and the (x, y) coordinates of the object's AABB center.  Stability requires the object's AABB to be fully contained within the surface's AABB.
           
           To achieve this, I'll systematically explore different rotation angles and corresponding (x, y) positions. The crucial point is that I must account for how the object's bounding box dimensions (W and H) change with rotation. These dimensions are given by: `W = w * abs(cos(theta)) + h * abs(sin(theta))` and `H = w * abs(sin(theta)) + h * abs(cos(theta))`, where *w* and *h* are the object's original dimensions. Because the object is almost square, the bounds for x and y are the "same" for angles `theta` and `theta + pi/2`.
           
           The surface's dimensions are fixed (0.27 x 0.27, centered at (0, 0)). I know that the center of the object's bounding box must lie within a specific range, determined by the surface dimensions and the object's bounding box width and height, depending on `theta`:
           `-0.135 + W/2 <= x <= 0.135 - W/2` and `-0.135 + H/2 <= y <= 0.135 - H/2`.
           
           To efficiently cover diverse placements, I'll do this:
           
           1.  **Angle Selection:** I'll use 10 distinct theta values, spaced evenly from 0 to 2pi/5 (5 values for first quadrant + its values + pi value): `[0, pi/5, 2pi/5, 3pi/5, 4pi/5, pi, 6pi/5, 7pi/5, 8pi/5, 9pi/5]`.
           2.  **Calculate W and H:** For each chosen `theta`, I'll calculate `W` and `H` using the formulas mentioned earlier, incorporating the object's `size_x` and `size_y` values.
           3.  **Determine Valid x and y Ranges:** Based on `W` and `H`, I'll compute the valid x and y ranges for the object's center using the formulas `min_x = surf_lower_x + W/2`, `max_x = surf_upper_x - W/2`, and the equivalent for y.
           4.  **Placement Selection within Ranges:** For each `theta`, I'll choose 5 specific (x, y) placements within their respective ranges. I'll use a centered point and the corners (and their counterparts). Specifically:
               *   Center point:  `((min_x + max_x) / 2, (min_y + max_y) / 2)`
               *   Four Corner (and their counterparts):
                   *   `(min_x, min_y)`
                   *   `(max_x, max_y)`
                   *   `(min_x, max_y)`
                   *   `(max_x, min_y)`
           
           This strategy ensures that I generate 50 unique placements.  It systematically explores different object orientations and surface positions.  This plan should provide sufficient diversity in placements.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placements for Object 4 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I've got this square object, Object 4, with dimensions of about 0.0777 x 0.0777. I need to figure out 50 stable placements for it on Surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into Object 5, which is already smack-dab in the center of the surface.
           
           Object 5 is pretty small and square itself, about 0.096 x 0.096.  Since it's in the center, I need to make sure Object 4 stays away from it to avoid collisions.  The surface is bounded by -0.135 and 0.135 in both x and y.
           
           The key here is that since Object 4 is square, different rotations will only change the *effective* size.  I'll be using this to avoid the existing object.
           At 0 and pi/2 rotation, the bounds are at their minimum,  and when at rotation pi/4 is at its maximum at sqrt(2) * size, so I need to choose carefully.
           I will have x and y ranges to satisfy. For each point and rotation, I will check whether the *corners* of Object 4 overlap with Object 5.
           
           So, I'm going to focus on rotations that keep the AABB small, like 0, pi/2, pi, and 3pi/2. For these rotations, the object's effective size is simply its original size (0.0777). Now, I'll calculate the clearance regions, based on the non-overlap, given an X/Y range.
           I need to find the zones outside the x and y bounds: `X_clear_zones` and `Y_clear_zones`.
           The idea will be, use an `x` and `y` in a *clear zone* to avoid overlapping.
           
           I think I've got a good plan.
           I will iterate the `theta` values, and the (x,y) values.
           First, use 48 values with 0 rotation, since this ensures sufficient values to choose from. This yields 48 points, for which `x` or `y` are in the clear zone.
           Pick two more from the same set, with `theta = pi/2` to reach the final count of 50.

(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable positions for Object 6 on Surface 0, ensuring it doesn't collide with existing Objects 4 and 5. Surface 0 is a rectangle with specific bounds.  Object 6 is a square of a given size.
           
           To achieve this, I need to consider two key constraints:
           1.  **Surface Containment:** Object 6 must stay within Surface 0.
           2.  **Collision Avoidance:** Object 6 cannot overlap with Object 4 or Object 5.
           
           Since Object 6 is square, I'll use `theta = 0` for simplicity.
           
           First, I define the safe range within Surface 0 where Object 6's center can reside, considering its size. Next, I need to check for overlaps by creating an area around each object.
           Object 5 is centered at the origin, so the forbidden region for Object 6 is around it. Similarly for Object 4.
           
           I generated a grid of candidate positions within the surface limits. For each candidate, I checked it for collisions with Obj5 (at origin) and Obj4 (at a specific bottom-left position). Points that failed both overlap checks are valid.
           I found that there are too many candidate locations that are not colliding, thus too many locations. I increased the granularity of points I test, and that got to a total of 87 possible solutions. I just took the first 50.
