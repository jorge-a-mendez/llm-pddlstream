(Thoughts: **Navigating the Unseen: My Approach to Locating a Target**
           
           Okay, here's the situation: I need to find three spots to place a robot, all within a radius of 2 from a target point at (0, 0). The catch? The robot can't be inside the boundaries of [-2.5, 2.5] for both x and y and has to avoid collisions with the fixed obstacles, AND has to have clear sight to the target. This all hinges on line-of-sight AND collision avoidance which presents a critical interpretation point: is this target point at (0,0) actually *within* an obstacle?
           
           Let me explain my line of thinking.
           
           First, I looked at the overall scene. The constraints on the robot’s (x, y) coordinates set the initial playing field. Then I noticed the placement of Obstacle 5 which is a vertical wall from y=-2.5 to y=2.5, right through x=0. Given I can't be inside a collision zone, the issue is that any "view" of (0,0) is likely blocked.
           
           Let me break down what makes (0, 0) tricky. Given the AABB of Obstacle 5 is `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))` then the target point, `(0,0)`, *is inside this AABB*. I've got a strong suspicion that I'm dealing with a scenario where this means there is no strict "line of sight" possible - but the prompt states I need to find *three* positions.
           
           So I need to be *outside* of it. Given my assumption I can only see one side of the (0,0) area (the right or the left side), all my solutions were crafted to have the robot only on one side of this wall and at the maximum viewing distance.
           
           To increase the chances, I will aim for positions just outside the wall at x=0. For diversity in the answers I'll place the robot in different places *only to the right of the wall*
           
           1.  **(0.1, 0.0):**  Directly to the right, to test the closest the robot can get without a collision zone violation and maximum view of the target. This location is directly to the right, just outside the obstacle’s x range.
           
           2.  **(0.1, 1.5):** This is on the right side but has y > 0 to have a different view of the target. Distance from (0,0) is `sqrt(2.26) approx 1.503`, it's well within the radius 2.
           
           3.  **(1.5, 0.0):**  Further away, keeping the distance to 2 but increasing x. The goal of this solution is to see if, despite an obstacle being in view, that this distance makes a difference.
           
           I am assuming a tolerance for the robot in line of sight check, where it must look over the edge of the obstacle. I will be sure to note this in my answer. If these fail, it means my core interpretation of the scenario is correct: (0, 0) is fundamentally blocked and is likely an *inside the obstacle* question to trick. I will be certain to clarify in my response. I have no other choice but to continue and follow the prompts given, and this will be my approach.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Target Point and Obstacle Geometry**
           
           Okay, so the provided feedback from the previous request wasn't for this target point, it was for the previous one. This means I need to wipe the slate clean and focus on this new target point: `(-2.1018290519714355, 2.1777336597442627)`. Approximating, that's `(-2.10, 2.18)`. The key observation is that this target point lies *inside* obstacle 8, which is a square: `((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25))`.  This is a big problem because the simulation seems to have strict line-of-sight rules, meaning a direct view of the point is probably impossible.
           
           **Collision Avoidance and Distance Constraints**
           
           I'm assuming the robot base has a radius of about 0.05. Therefore, I need to keep a buffer of about 0.1 around the obstacles to avoid collisions. The distance constraint to the target point is 2 (max range).
           
           **Addressing the Dilemma: Target Inside an Obstacle**
           
           The tricky part: if the target is inside an obstacle, can I still find a valid position?  Based on the feedback, I need to assume that "line-of-sight to the target" means the robot can *see* the target *through* a face of obstacle 8. This is the only way to meet the problem requirements and avoid a contradictory "impossible" scenario.
           
           **Proposed Positions (with Safety Buffer)**
           
           To safely observe and maintain the buffer with a radius of 0.05, and be within range:
           
           1.  `(-1.65, 2.1777)`:  This position is right of obstacle 8.
           2.  `(-2.1018, 1.65)`: This position is below obstacle 8.
           3.  `(-2.35, 2.1777)`: This position is left of obstacle 8.
           
           All positions are near the obstacle 8 but still maintain distance requirements with regards to the maximum range.
           
           These three positions should give the best chance of successful line of sight given that the target point is inside of obstacle 8.
