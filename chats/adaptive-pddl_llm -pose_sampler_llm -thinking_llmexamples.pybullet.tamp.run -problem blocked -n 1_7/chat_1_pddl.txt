           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning to Satisfy `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My goal is to find a plan to achieve the state described by `new-axiom@0()`, which requires an object `?green` that is both "on" another object (`v18`) and of a specific "type" (`v17`).
           
           I started by examining the initial state, looking for objects that are of the correct type.  I found two possibilities: `v8` and `v12`. Since the problem does not specify optimization criteria, I arbitrarily chose `v8` as my object `?green`.
           
           To achieve `on(v8, v18)`, I need to ensure `v8` is supported by `v18` at some pose. The initial state already provides the necessary information: `v8` is supported on `#o2` by `v18`.  Furthermore, it states `v8` is at pose `v9`, and that `v12` is at pose `v13` on `v14`.
           
           Given this, I identified a viable plan:
           
           1. **Pick**:  Use arm `v4` to grasp `v8` (grasp #o1) from its current pose `v9` while maintaining the base configuration at `v3` and employing an arm trajectory `#o4`.
           2. **Place**: Use the same arm `v4` to place `v8` at pose `#o2` using grasp `#o1`, keeping the base at `v3` and the arm trajectory as `#o4`.
           
           I then meticulously verified the preconditions for the pick and place actions, ensuring that all necessary facts were true within the initial and expected derived states. This involved checking grasp information and the kinematics facts, and making an assumption based on the lack of negative constraints. The fact that the base could not move further strengthened this plan and confirmed that parameters like `#o3` must evaluate to `v3`.
           
           Having confirmed this plan satisfies the goal, I decided to proceed with it. It should also be noted that if the constraints are met for v8, they also will apply to v12. So there is flexibility in the implementation.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Problem: An Impossibility Theorem**
           
           Okay, so the user's point is clear: those `pick` and `place` actions I was assuming? Totally off-limits.  The only thing I can do is this `move_base` action, which essentially gets me nowhere since I'm already *at* the configuration specified (v3).  It’s a non-starter.
           
           Let's break this down further.  My goal is to get something, the green object, *on* v18.  That means I need to manipulate the world: I need to pick something up and put it down.  I have my initial state: a bunch of stuff is currently on other stuff (v8 on v11, v12 on v14, etc.) and I *can* put v8 or v12 on v18. This means I would have to pick v8 from v11 and put it on v18. Or pick v12 from v14 and place it on v18.  But I *can't* do that.
           
           Why?  Because I only have *one* action at my disposal: `move_base`. This does nothing to objects, just relocates the base. No manipulation. No changing `on` predicates. It's essentially a no-op in the face of this problem.
           
           Therefore, given the available actions, the goal is *unachievable*. It's a fundamental conflict between the required operations and the allowed operations. I can't interact with the world in the way I need to.
