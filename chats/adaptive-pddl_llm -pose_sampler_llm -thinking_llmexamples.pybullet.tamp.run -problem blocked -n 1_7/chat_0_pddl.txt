           Surfaces ((lower_x, lower_y), (upper_x, upper_y)):
           
           ```
           0: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))
           ```
           
           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 5) -- 0.07000000000000028, 0.06999999999999995)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **My strategy for placing the object 50 times on surface 0 is to ensure the object's AABB is fully contained.** First, I'll calculate the valid ranges for the object's center based on the surface dimensions and the object's dimensions (0.07 x 0.07).  Since the object is a square, its effective AABB size changes with rotation.  I'll consider the most constrained case - maximum rotation. The maximum effective dimensions when rotated is `0.07 * sqrt(2)`. So, to be safe, I’ll use the tighter AABB bounds based on this rotated dimension.
           
           I will then distribute 50 placements based on these calculations to cover both 0 and 45 degree rotations. I'll define a grid of 25 valid (x, y) coordinates. Half of the placements will have an orientation of 0 radians (`theta = 0`). The other half will use the range for `pi/4` (45 degrees). This will ensure diverse and stable placements.  The output will be in the requested format: (surface index, rotation angle, x-coordinate, y-coordinate).
