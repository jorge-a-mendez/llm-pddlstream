User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.111, -0.314), (-0.035, -0.238)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.158, 0.135), (0.256, 0.233)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.099, -0.594), (-0.002, -0.497)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.253, 0.207), (-0.159, 0.301)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.073, -0.276, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, -0.04).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.207, 0.184, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.948, -0.319).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.05, -0.546, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.961, 0.278).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.206, 0.254, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.232, 0.973).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Analysis and Unreachability Determination**
           
           My primary goal is to determine a plan to move four objects, `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`, onto object `v18`. This requires the `on` predicate to be true for each object, which, by the given axiom, necessitates finding a pose where each object can be supported on `v18`.
           
           Analyzing the initial state, I identify the starting positions of the objects and their target conditions. `v8` is at `v9` on `v11`, `v12` is at `v13` on `v11`, `v14` is at `v15` on `v11`, and `v16` is at `v17` on `v11`. All target poses will involve a continuous parameter `#o2`, which will be a position on `v18`.
           
           The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, at specific configurations and in the `handempty` state, and a base at `v3`. However, the base is constrained to remain at `v3` due to the action instance `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.
           
           A potential plan would involve picking up each object from its initial pose and placing it at a new pose, `#o2`, on `v18`. This would require a sequence of `pick` and `place` actions. The `pick` action's preconditions include `kin`, `atpose`, `handempty`, and `atbconf`, along with collision-free assumptions. Similarly, the `place` action has `kin`, `atgrasp`, `atbconf`, and collision-free conditions.
           
           However, the critical constraint is: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." The provided list only contains `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This severely restricts my actions. The problem's phrasing strongly suggests that the provided action list is *exhaustive*. If that's the case, I cannot use `pick` or `place` actions, because those action instances are not in the given list.
           
           The absence of `pick` and `place` instances effectively makes the goal unachievable. No action other than `move_base v3 v3 #o0` can alter object locations or satisfy the `on` predicate. While I could define collision-free placements on `v18` with respect to the objects' AABBs, without pick and place actions, this planning task is impossible. Therefore, given the constraints of the problem, the goal is unreachable.
