User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object

           v15: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.111, -0.314), (-0.035, -0.238)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.158, 0.135), (0.256, 0.233)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.099, -0.594), (-0.002, -0.497)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.253, 0.207), (-0.159, 0.301)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.073, -0.276, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, -0.04).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.207, 0.184, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.948, -0.319).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.05, -0.546, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.961, 0.278).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.206, 0.254, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.232, 0.973).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning to Arrange Objects on a Surface**
           
           My objective is to move four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) from their current locations onto a specific surface, v18. I need to achieve this by using the `on` predicate, which requires placing each object at a specific pose on v18 that is supported by it.
           
           First, I examined the `supported` facts related to v18. It turns out that each object is supported at a pose named `#o2`. However, the prompt specifies that if I need to use the same symbolic pose name for multiple objects placed at the same spot, then I must provide unique continuous values for each object on the same spot. So, I will have to define unique poses for each object and assign it to its own `#o2` name on v18. I am constrained by the fact that the robot base can't move.
           
           Since I have to move these objects from the current positions, I will use arm v4 (v4) and its available actions, like `pick` and `place`. The robot base is fixed, so there will be no base movements.
           
           My plan involves picking up each object from its initial pose (v9, v13, v15, v17) using v4 and placing it at a new, distinct pose `#o2` on v18, with the same grasp `#o1` each time. I have to find distinct positions on v18 where the objects will not collide with each other. I will use the `kin` predicate which indicates that `v4` can potentially pick objects from their initial poses and place them at the target pose.
           
           I will define four distinct pose locations on v18. They will all have a z-height of 0.781 and a theta of 0.0, and they will be arranged in a quadrant configuration of top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right. The coordinate values will be: (-0.06, 0.06), (0.06, 0.06), (-0.06, -0.06), (0.06, -0.06).
           
           **Here's the detailed plan:**
           
           1.  **Move v8:**
               *   `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4_pick_v8)`
               *   `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4_place_v8)` (where #o2 corresponds to `-0.06 0.06 0.781 0.0` for v8)
           2.  **Move v12:**
               *   `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, v3, #o4_pick_v12)`
               *   `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4_place_v12)` (where #o2 corresponds to `0.06 0.06 0.781 0.0` for v12)
           3.  **Move v14:**
               *   `pick(v4, v14, v15, #o1, v3, #o4_pick_v14)`
               *   `place(v4, v14, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4_place_v14)` (where #o2 corresponds to `-0.06 -0.06 0.781 0.0` for v14)
           4.  **Move v16:**
               *   `pick(v4, v16, v17, #o1, v3, #o4_pick_v16)`
               *   `place(v4, v16, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4_place_v16)` (where #o2 corresponds to `0.06 -0.06 0.781 0.0` for v16)
           
           This plan ensures all objects are moved to the desired position. I must define different poses for #o2, because the object pose is in the initial state. The total cost will be 8 (2 for each object). The `move_base` cost is 0.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment: An Impossible Plan**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a plan, but it's immediately apparent that it's fundamentally flawed. The plan relies on `pick` and `place` actions to manipulate objects, but *those* actions are explicitly disallowed. The only thing I'm permitted to do is move the robot's base from `v3` to `v3` - essentially a no-op.
           
           The stated goal is to get four objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) onto a location, v18. A quick check of the initial state confirms that these objects are *not* currently on v18. Instead, they are on v11. To get them to v18, I'd need to pick them up from v11 and place them on v18. Standard stuff.
           
           But here's the kicker: I *can't* pick or place. My only action is a trivial base movement, which won't do *anything* towards achieving the goal. It doesn't modify object poses, it doesn't enable any manipulation actions, and it's a zero-cost operation.
           
           Given these constraints, the goal is unreachable. There's no way to translate the objects from their initial positions to the desired ones with the limited actions I'm allowed. It's a classic case of an incomplete action set. I need a re-plan with the proper pick and place actions, or, at least, their equivalent in this constrained domain.
