User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning for Generating Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, here's my thought process for generating 25 valid robot base positions for a given target point. I've been given a set of constraints and obstacles, and my goal is to find positions that avoid collisions and maintain line-of-sight to the target, all within a specific working area.
           
           First, I need to understand the environment. I've been given the AABB (axis-aligned bounding boxes) of several fixed obstacles. There's a large rectangular boundary and some internal obstacles, including a prominent vertical pillar in the middle of the workspace. This pillar is critical because it will likely obstruct the view of the target from some positions.
           
           My primary constraints are the robot's positional limits (`x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5]`), the maximum distance from the target (4 units), and the need to avoid collisions with the fixed obstacles.  Also, crucially, I need a clear line of sight to the target from each base position.  The robot's orientation (theta) will be automatically adjusted to face the target, so that's not a variable.
           
           The main challenge is balancing these constraints, especially the need to avoid obstacles while maintaining a good distribution of positions. I'll need a strategy to efficiently explore the possible locations.
           
           I've decided on the following approach:
           
           1.  **Define a search space:**  The robot must be within the rectangle defined by `x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5]` and within a circle with a radius of 4 centered on the target point. I'll define these bounds with functions: `is_within_robot_limits` which checks against the rectangle and `is_within_max_range` which checks the circular distance.
           2.  **Generate candidate positions:** I will generate a diverse set of candidate positions. I'll initially generate positions in rings (circles) around the target at varying radii. For each radius, I'll sample multiple angles to ensure diverse viewpoints. I'll also use a finer grid search if I don't get the required number of positions in the circular sampling.
           3.  **Validate each position:** For each candidate position, I'll use `is_valid_position` to check three conditions:  a)  It must be within the positional constraints. b)  It cannot collide with any fixed obstacles (I'll define robot dimensions for this, as the robot size is not explicitly stated, but for now I assume the robot is a point).  c) The segment to target must not intersect any obstacles (LOS check) using a customized Liang-Barsky line segment clipping algorithm (`intersects_segment_aabb`). To simplify the collision and line of sight checks, I'll add a buffer around the bounding boxes of the objects to represent a collision margin.
           4.  **Prioritize clear line of sight:** The fact that the target is on one side of a significant central obstacle means I need to be strategic. So I'll initially generate the candidates such that the candidate points are situated around the hemisphere away from the obstacle. After the first generation pass, I can use a grid search to further cover the area. The key is to check all possible line-of-sights for the candidates generated.
           
           Because the prompt specifies that feedback will be given if a position is invalid, my plan is to iterate until I find 25 valid positions. I'll consider that if a position fails repeatedly, it is most likely an invalid case. Given the constraints and the simple geometry of the obstacles, I can use a simpler heuristic and not have the robot "chasing" a spot it can't achieve line of sight.
           
           The core of my approach is to efficiently validate each generated position using the geometric checks and filter out any invalid ones. This process requires carefully considering both the positioning and line-of-sight constraints to produce valid and useful robot base positions.
