User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object

           v10: object
           v11: object

           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.513, 0.367), (-4.42, 0.459)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.466, 0.413, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.839, 0.544).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's my thought process, as a seasoned planner, for solving this object manipulation task:**
           
           First, the goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially means getting an object to be *both* of a specific type *and* on a specific surface. I immediately see the two candidate objects, `v8` and `v12`, that are of the required type. Now, I need to figure out how to get one of them onto the right surface, `v18`.
           
           Since the `on` predicate needs objects to be "supported", I look for existing "supported" facts in the initial state. Bingo! I find `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. This tells me that if I can get `v8` to pose `#o2`, it will also fulfill my goal. Now my focus shifts to identifying a feasible plan for getting the robot to move `v8` to `#o2`.
           
           The initial state suggests that `v8` is currently supported at `v11` (via `supported(v8,v9,v11)`) and is at pose `v9` (with `atpose(v8, v9)`), so I need to:
           1. pick `v8` from `v9`
           2. place `v8` on `#o2`
           
           I identify the robot arms available, `v4` and `v6`. I check the preconditions for the standard pick and place actions, and confirm that there are kinematic solutions. The only action that is needed is `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)` where the action `move_base` is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.
           
           A key consideration is collision-free motion. Given that I have to work with this model, the absence of any fact, including the collision-free conditions, automatically means true, by the instructions, making all motions appear safe.
           
           Therefore, the plan:
           1. `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           2. `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)` should work without risk of any collisions.
           I pick a continuous pose for `#o2` on the surface of `v18` that's feasible. The rest are parameters the plan already specifies.
           
           Finally, the total cost for the plan is 2 (pick and place).

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Plan's Impossibility**
           
           Okay, so I've carefully reviewed the constraints. The user was correct; the suggested plan is flawed because it included actions that aren't in the provided `valid action instances`.  The only valid action is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  This is a significant hurdle.
           
           Let's break down the problem. The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to needing an object of type `v17` *on* surface `v18`.  We're given initial facts about object types and poses. Specifically, we have objects `v8` and `v12` that *could* be on `v18`.  The problem boils down to getting one of them *onto* `v18`.
           
           To put an object on `v18`, I need a supported relationship and the `atpose` predicate to be true for that object on `#o2`. This requires manipulating these objects, essentially picking them up and placing them. However, here's the catch: the *only* permissible action is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This action, unfortunately, *does not* interact with objects.  It simply moves the base, and not effectively, because it resets the `canmove` predicate.
           
           Essentially, I'm stuck with a robot that can move *itself* but cannot pick up or put down any of the objects.  Therefore, I conclude that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is *unachievable* given the restrictions. The robot cannot interact with the objects, and thus, I cannot generate a valid plan.
