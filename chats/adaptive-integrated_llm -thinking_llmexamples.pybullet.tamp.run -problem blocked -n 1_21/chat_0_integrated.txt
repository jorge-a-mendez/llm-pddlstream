User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.513, 0.367), (-4.42, 0.459)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.466, 0.413, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.839, 0.544).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom pose(v15, v16)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom stackable(v12, v18)
           Atom stackable(v8, v18)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom graspable(v15)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom type(v12, v17)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v14)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom type(v8, v17)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom stackable(v15, v10)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unachievable Goal State**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0`, which boils down to ensuring some object, let's call it `?green`, is both *on* `v18` and of type `v17`. Looking at the initial state, objects `v12` and `v8` fit the bill for `?green` as they are both of type `v17`.
           
           Now, for an object to be *on* something, it needs to be supported by it and placed at a valid pose. Examining the support facts, both `v12` and `v8` *are* supported on `v18`, but they're *not* at poses that would place them on `v18`. Currently, `v12` is at pose `v13` and `v8` at `v9`.
           
           Here's the rub: the only action I'm *allowed* to use is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action doesn't let me manipulate objects' poses; it's a base motion that changes only base configurations and `canmove` flags. Since I can't pick up `v8` or `v12` and *place* them on `v18`, I can't satisfy the *on* predicate and therefore cannot achieve the goal. No matter how many times I try `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, I can't change where `v8` or `v12` are placed.
           
           Given the constraints, the goal state is unreachable from the initial conditions. There's no way to arrange `v8` or `v12` onto `v18` with only a `move_base` action.
