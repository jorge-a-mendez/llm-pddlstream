           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.513, 0.367), (-4.42, 0.459)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.466, 0.413, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.839, 0.544).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, here's the thought process: I need to figure out a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This means I need to make sure that an object of a particular type is `on` another object. The axioms tell me I need something like `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. I've got two potential objects that are the correct type - `v12` and `v8`.
           
           Now I need to find something `on` `v18`. I know that something is "on" something else if it's supported by it and at a certain pose. Let's see what's currently true about those predicates... It looks like neither `v12` nor `v8` are currently `on` `v18`. So I have to *make* that happen.
           
           `v18` is a surface, and it looks like a nice place to put something. `v8` is graspable, and it is at a good pose on `v11`. It seems easier to move `v8` to `v18`.
           
           I've got actions available, and I can move `v8` with the robot arm. This involves the actions `pick` and `place`. I know I can move the robot and it can pick something up, and I can move it to a pose and put it down. These actions will let me pick `v8` from `v9` and place it on `v18`.
           
           I'll need to move the robot base to the right place to pick it up and again to put it down. I can get to these base configurations using `move_base`. So the plan is: move base, pick, move base, place.
           
           The initial robot configuration is: free arm, and base configuration `v3`.
           
           The final step is `place(v4, v8, #p0, #g0, #q1, #t2)`, where `#p0` is the pose of `v8` on `v18`.
           
           Okay, the pose `#p0`: I need to put `v8` at a good spot on the surface of `v18`. Based on the AABB information, placing it near the center seems sensible so it's stable. `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8)` should work, with a neutral orientation.
           
           I considered an alternative of using `v12`, but picking it up from one spot and putting it on `v18` would require a single `move_base`, and a double cross-robot pick-place which is unlikely in this situation.
           
           Given the geometry of the scene and the provided actions, placing `v8` on `v18` is much more efficient and practical. The plan should work.
