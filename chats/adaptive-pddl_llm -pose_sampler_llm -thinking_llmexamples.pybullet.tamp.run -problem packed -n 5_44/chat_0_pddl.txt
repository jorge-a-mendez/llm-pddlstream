(Thoughts: **A Precise Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's my strategy. I need to find 50 stable positions for object ID 6 on surface 0, a square with dimensions -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. The object is a nearly square AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) with dimensions (0.0764, 0.0764). My approach focuses on considering both translation and rotation.
           
           First, I need to account for the object's size and possible rotations. Since the object is almost square, rotations don't drastically change its overall AABB. To ensure it fits entirely within the surface, I'll calculate the valid range for the center (x, y) given a rotation `theta`. I'll consider five key rotation values: 0, π/6, π/4, π/3, and π/2.
           
           For each rotation, I'll determine the maximum extent of the rotated object's AABB.  I'll use the AABB extents to constrain the object's center coordinates (x, y) to a specific region. For example, with `theta = 0`, I calculate that `x` and `y` must be within [-0.0968, 0.0968]. Rotating introduces slightly different x and y ranges.
           
           To create the 50 placements, I'll do this: for the first five rotations (0, π/6, π/4, π/3, π/2), I'll generate a 3x3 grid of positions within the valid x, y ranges for each rotation, giving me 9 placement candidates per rotation, so 45 placements. Then, for the remaining 5 placements,  I'll use rotation `pi/12` and pick 5 placements within its associated valid x,y ranges.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Finding Safe Placements for Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've got the successful placement of object 6, right in the bottom-left corner of surface 0. Now, I need to figure out where to put object 5 on the same surface, without them colliding. Object 5 is almost a perfect square, and I know its dimensions and the surface boundaries.
           
           My plan is to try different rotations and systematically check for collisions. I'll break down the surface into a grid and generate multiple positions, using a careful set of coordinates so I'm not wasting any computations.
           
           I need 50 valid placements. To guarantee this, I'm choosing various coordinates. I will avoid object 6's AABB by ensuring that any placement for object 5 is either *completely* to the right of object 6 or *completely* above it, or both.
           
           For each rotation, I'll calculate the new AABB dimensions of the rotated object 5. Then, for each position in the grid, I'll calculate collision or non-collision, selecting only the locations which will not collide with object 6.
