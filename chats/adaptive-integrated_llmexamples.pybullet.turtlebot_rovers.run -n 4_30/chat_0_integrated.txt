           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks us to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom representing a complex state. The axiom has several conditions:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`
           3. `free(v12, v16)`
           4. `free(v14, v16)`
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           7. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           8. `receivedimage(v20, v11)`
           9. `type(?stone, v2)` (This is already true in the initial state as v1, v4, v3 are type v2 (rock))
           10. `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (Need to analyze a rock and send the analysis)
           11. `type(?soil, v6)` (This is already true in the initial state as v5, v8, v7 are type v6 (soil))
           12. `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (Need to analyze a soil sample and send the analysis)
           
           Let's check the initial state:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` is true.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)` is true.
           - `free(v12, v16)` is true.
           - `free(v14, v16)` is true.
           
           So, the first four conditions are already met. We need to satisfy conditions 5-8 and 10, 12.
           Conditions 5-8 require receiving images for objectives v17, v18, v19, v20 in mode v11.
           Conditions 10 and 12 require receiving analysis for a rock (type v2) and a soil sample (type v6).
           
           Rover v12 has the camera v10 which supports mode v11.
           Rover v14 also has the camera v10.
           
           Let's plan for getting the images first. We need to take images and then send them.
           For `receivedimage(v17, v11)`:
           - Rover `v12` or `v14` needs to be at a configuration where it can `imagevisible` to `v17`. Both `v12` and `v14` are imagevisible to `v17` from `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           - Then, calibrate the camera `v10` for that rover at that config and object.
           - Then, take the image.
           - Then, send the image.
           
           The same applies to `v18`, `v19`, `v20`. Both rovers are imagevisible to all these objectives from the same configuration `#o3` with the same ray `#o4`. This suggests using one rover to take all images. Let's use `v14` as it's also `comvisible` to the lander `v9` from `#o0` with ray `#o1`. Rover `v12` is also comvisible from `#o0` with ray `#o1`.
           
           For `receivedanalysis(?r)`:
           - We need to `sample_rock` for a `rock` (type `v2`) and `soil` (type `v6`).
           - Then, `send_analysis` for them.
           
           Rocks available: `v1` (type `v2`), `v4` (type `v2`), `v3` (type `v2`), `v8` (type `v6`), `v5` (type `v6`), `v7` (type `v6`).
           We need to sample one rock of type `v2` and one of type `v6`.
           Rover `v14` is `above` `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` from `#o5`.
           Rover `v12` is `above` `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` from `#o5`.
           
           Let's try to use rover `v14` for both image collection and sample analysis.
           Rover `v14` is at `v15`.
           We need to calibrate the camera before taking an image.
           We need to take images of `v17, v18, v19, v20`.
           All are imagevisible from `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           
           Plan:
           1. Calibrate `v10` on `v14` for object `v17` at `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           2. Take image of `v17` with `v14`, `v10`, `v11` at `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           3. Send image of `v17` with `v14` to `v9` at `#o0` with ray `#o1`.
           4. Take image of `v18`. Camera `v10` is now uncalibrated. So need to calibrate again.
           5. Calibrate `v10` on `v14` for `v18` at `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           6. Take image of `v18` with `v14`, `v10`, `v11` at `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           7. Send image of `v18` with `v14` to `v9` at `#o0` with ray `#o1`.
           8. Repeat for `v19` and `v20`.
           
           After sending all images, we need to analyze rocks.
           Let's choose `v1` (type `v2`) and `v5` (type `v6`). Both are above `v14` at `#o5`.
           `v14` is free `v16`.
           1. Sample `v1` (rock) at `#o5` for `v14` to store `v16`.
           2. Send analysis of `v1` with `v14` to `v9` at `#o0` with ray `#o1`.
           3. Drop `v1` from `v14`'s store `v16` to make it free again.
           4. Sample `v5` (soil) at `#o5` for `v14` to store `v16`.
           5. Send analysis of `v5` with `v14` to `v9` at `#o0` with ray `#o1`.
           
           It seems `#o3`, `#o4`, `#o0`, `#o1`, `#o5` are the continuous parameters that need values.
           `#o3` is a configuration for `imagevisible` of `v14` to `v19, v20, v18, v17`.
           `#o5` is a configuration for `above` for `v14` to `v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8`.
           `#o0` is a configuration for `comvisible` of `v14` to `v9`.
           `#o4` is a ray for `imagevisible`.
           `#o1` is a ray for `comvisible`.
           
           The crucial thing here is that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is an axiom that only evaluates to true if all its component predicates are true. The initial state already satisfies many of these (all the `atconf` and `free` predicates). The main task is to satisfy the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           
           It is possible to use the existing `v15` and `v13` configurations if they satisfy the visibility conditions for taking images and sending data, but the problem description clearly states that if a configuration starting with '#' is in the initial state and is used in the plan, then we must provide a continuous value for it. Since `#o3`, `#o5`, `#o0` are in the initial state and are for `v14` (and `v12`), they must be used.
           The problem statement mentions "Any object that starts with a '#' represents a continuous parameter ... If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that conf(rover, #<name>) is in the initial state ... then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration". This implies we need to use `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` for `v14` or `v12`.
           
           Let's set some coordinates for the continuous parameters.
           Lander `v9` is at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). Let's use (-1.9, -2.0) as a representative point.
           Rover `v14` at `v15` is at (-1.0, -1.75).
           For `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`: `v14` needs to see `v9`. A configuration near `v15` is fine. Let's use `#o0` = (-1.0, -1.75). The ray `#o1` would be from (-1.0, -1.75) to (-1.9, -2.0).
           For `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)`: `v19` is at ((1.896, 1.964), (1.992, 2.06)). Let's use (1.95, 2.01) as a representative point. Rover `v14` at `v15` is at (-1.0, -1.75). This is far. We need a new configuration for `v14` for taking images. The `imagerange` is 2. The distance from `v14` (at `v15`) to `v19` is about `sqrt((1.95 - (-1.0))^2 + (2.01 - (-1.75))^2)` = `sqrt(2.95^2 + 3.76^2)` = `sqrt(8.7025 + 14.1376)` = `sqrt(22.84)` approx 4.77, which is too far.
           However, there are no `move` actions to change the configurations of `v12` or `v14` to `#o3` or `#o0` or `#o5`. The only move actions are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`. These mean that `v12` can move from `v13` to `v13` (i.e. stay at `v13`) and `v14` can move from `v15` to `v15` (stay at `v15`). This implies that the rovers cannot change their base configurations.
           Therefore, all actions (`take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`) must be performed while `v12` is at `v13` and `v14` is at `v15`. This greatly simplifies the problem. The `#oX` continuous parameters for configurations must be the same as `v13` or `v15` for the respective rover.
           
           Let's re-evaluate based on `v12` being fixed at `v13` and `v14` fixed at `v15`.
           Initial state:
           `conf(v12, v13)`
           `atconf(v12, v13)`
           `conf(v14, v15)`
           `atconf(v14, v15)`
           
           For `v14`:
           - `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)` is true in initial state. This means `#o3` must be `v15`.
           - `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v20)` is true, so `#o3` is `v15`.
           - `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` is true, so `#o3` is `v15`.
           - `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` is true, so `#o3` is `v15`.
           - `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` is true, so `#o0` must be `v15`.
           - `above(v14, #o5, v5)` is true, so `#o5` must be `v15`.
           - Similarly for all other `above` predicates for `v14`.
           
           For `v12`:
           - `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v20)` is true in initial state. This means `#o3` must be `v13`.
           - `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)` is true, so `#o3` is `v13`.
           - `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` is true, so `#o3` is `v13`.
           - `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` is true, so `#o3` is `v13`.
           - `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` is true, so `#o0` must be `v13`.
           - `above(v12, #o5, v7)` is true, so `#o5` must be `v13`.
           - Similarly for all other `above` predicates for `v12`.
           
           This means `v13` and `v15` must be the configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` for `v12` and `v14` respectively.
           However, if `#o3` for `v14` is `v15` and `#o3` for `v12` is `v13`, then there are two different `#o3` values. This is allowed, as the problem statement says "If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name."
           Here `#o3` and `#o0` and `#o5` are named parameters. If `#o3` is used for `v14` and also for `v12`, it implies the same continuous value. This is a contradiction.
           However, the initial state has `conf(v14, #o3)` and `conf(v12, #o3)`. This means `#o3` must be *one* configuration. The `imagevisible` and `comvisible` and `above` predicates must be true for this single `#o3` and `#o0` and `#o5`. This is very unlikely given the distances.
           
           Let's assume the continuous parameters `#o0, #o3, #o5` are flexible to be set to `v13` or `v15` depending on the rover. The problem statement says "If the plan you select uses some object #<name> such that conf(rover, #<name>) is in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration". This would imply that `#o3` can be `v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14`. But the initial state has `conf(v14, #o3)` and `conf(v12, #o3)`. This implies a single continuous value for `#o3`.
           This is a standard PDDL interpretation issue. Usually, if `#o3` is a common variable for multiple rovers, it's the same object. However, the problem specifies a format for continuous values if it is used for `(rover, target)` pair, implying that even if it's named the same, it can refer to different physical configurations. Let's assume this is the case. So for `v14` the config `#o3` means `v15`, and for `v12` the config `#o3` means `v13`.
           
           Let's verify the visibility and `above` predicates with the given AABBs and current fixed rover positions.
           Rover `v14` is at `v15` = (-1.0, -1.75).
           Lander `v9` is ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). This is within `comrange` (4) of `v14` at `v15`. `dist(v15, v9_center)` = `dist((-1.0, -1.75), (-1.9, -2.0))` = `sqrt((-0.9)^2 + (-0.25)^2)` = `sqrt(0.81 + 0.0625)` = `sqrt(0.8725)` ~ 0.93. This is within range 4.
           
           Objective `v19` is ((1.896, 1.964), (1.992, 2.06)). Distance from `v15` to `v19_center` (1.95, 2.01) is `sqrt((1.95 - (-1.0))^2 + (2.01 - (-1.75))^2)` = `sqrt(2.95^2 + 3.76^2)` = `sqrt(8.7025 + 14.1376)` = `sqrt(22.84)` ~ 4.77. This is NOT within `imagerange` (2).
           This means `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)` as stated in the initial state must be false if `#o3` is `v15`.
           This contradicts the initial state and the problem statement of "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is *false*".
           The only way this could be true is if `#o3` for `v14` is NOT `v15`. But `conf(v14, #o3)` implies `#o3` is `v15` if `v14` cannot move.
           Let's re-read: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration such that, given the geometry of the scene, the configuration is collision-free for the rover, reachable from the rover's current configuration, and has occlusion-free line-of-sight to the target object in the fourth argument in the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate."
           This means `#o3` for `v14` is a *new* configuration, not necessarily `v15`, but must be reachable from `v15`. However, there are no `move` actions to reach `#o3` or `#o0` or `#o5` if they are different from `v15`. The only `move` actions are identity moves. This implies that if `v14` needs to be at a different configuration, the goal is unreachable.
           
           Let's assume the problem intends that the `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, `above` predicates listed in the initial state are true *with* the given `#oX` continuous parameters as *potentially new configurations*, and that the `atconf(rover, base_config)` is merely the *initial* configuration, not necessarily the *only* configuration the rover can be in throughout the plan.
           However, since there are no actions to move to `#o3`, `#o0`, or `#o5`, the rovers cannot reach these configurations if they are different from `v13` or `v15`.
           
           If the `imagevisible` etc. predicates were `imagevisible(v14, v15, ray, target)` then we could use `v15`. But they are `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)`.
           This seems like a critical contradiction. The only valid `move` actions are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`, which means rovers stay at their initial configurations `v13` and `v15`. If this is the case, then any `imagevisible` or `comvisible` or `above` predicate that relies on `#o3`, `#o0`, `#o5` being different from `v13` or `v15` would be false. But the initial state lists them as true.
           
           The statement "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is *false*" is key. But here the facts *are* explicitly stated in the initial state. The issue is how `#oX` is interpreted. "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that conf(rover, #<name>) is in the initial state... then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration..."
           This implies that `#o3` for `v14` *could be* different from `v15`, and if so, we need to provide a value. But how does `v14` get to `#o3`? It can't, because no `move` action for it.
           
           This means that if `#o3` is different from `v15`, it's impossible to execute the `take_image` action. The only way is if `#o3` IS `v15`.
           Let's assume that the `#oX` parameters mentioned in the initial state are indeed `v13` (for `v12`) and `v15` (for `v14`), and the problem setter has implicitly verified that these `imagevisible`/`comvisible`/`above` predicates are true for these fixed configurations given the geometry (even if my quick distance check indicates otherwise for some cases). Given the strict nature of PDDL, I must assume the initial state is entirely true as given. Therefore, for `v14`, all `#oX` configs are effectively `v15`, and for `v12`, all `#oX` configs are effectively `v13`.
           
           So, the plan would use `v15` for `v14`'s actions, and `v13` for `v12`'s actions.
           Since `conf(v14, #o3)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)` are in the initial state, it means that for `v14` and `v19`, the configuration `#o3` effectively *is* `v15`. This means we need to provide `v15` as the continuous value for `#o3` when it's used with `v14`.
           Same for `#o0` and `#o5`.
           
           Let's use `v14` for everything.
           Rover `v14` is at `v15`.
           Objectives to image: `v17, v18, v19, v20`. All are `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, <objective>)`.
           Lander to communicate: `v9`. `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`.
           Rocks to analyze: `v1` (type v2, rock), `v5` (type v6, soil). Both are `above(v14, #o5, <rock>)`.
           
           The plan steps using `v14`:
           1. Calibrate camera `v10` on `v14` for `v17` (or any objective) using `#o3` and `#o4`.
           2. Take image of `v17` using `v14`, camera `v10`, mode `v11` at `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           3. Send image of `v17` from `v14` to `v9` using `#o0` and `#o1` for `v11`.
           4. (Recalibrate for each image as `take_image` uncalibrates)
           5. Calibrate `v10` on `v14` for `v18` using `#o3` and `#o4`.
           6. Take image of `v18`.
           7. Send image of `v18`.
           8. Calibrate `v10` on `v14` for `v19`.
           9. Take image of `v19`.
           10. Send image of `v19`.
           11. Calibrate `v10` on `v14` for `v20`.
           12. Take image of `v20`.
           13. Send image of `v20`.
           14. Sample rock `v1` (type v2) with `v14` at `#o5` into store `v16`.
           15. Send analysis of `v1` from `v14` to `v9` using `#o0` and `#o1`.
           16. Drop rock `v1` from `v14`'s store `v16` (to free up for the next sample).
           17. Sample rock `v5` (type v6) with `v14` at `#o5` into store `v16`.
           18. Send analysis of `v5` from `v14` to `v9` using `#o0` and `#o1`.
           
           This plan seems viable given the interpretation that `#oX` when used with a specific rover refers to its base configuration (since it cannot move).
           We will need to specify continuous values for `#o0`, `#o1`, `#o3`, `#o4`, `#o5`.
           Since `v14` is fixed at `v15`, then `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` will all take the value of `v15`.
           Let's find center coordinates for target objects to define rays.
           `v19` (objective): ((1.896, 1.964), (1.992, 2.06)) -> center (1.944, 2.012)
           `v20` (objective): ((-0.587, 2.102), (-0.502, 2.187)) -> center (-0.5445, 2.1445)
           `v18` (objective): ((0.251, 1.753), (0.345, 1.848)) -> center (0.298, 1.8005)
           `v17` (objective): ((-1.895, 2.135), (-1.808, 2.222)) -> center (-1.8515, 2.1785)
           `v9` (lander): ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)) -> center (-1.9, -2.0)
           
           `v15`: (-1.0, -1.75)
           
           For `#o4` (ray for images):
           - `(v14, v17)`: from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `v17_center` (-1.8515, 2.1785)
           - `(v14, v18)`: from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `v18_center` (0.298, 1.8005)
           - `(v14, v19)`: from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `v19_center` (1.944, 2.012)
           - `(v14, v20)`: from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `v20_center` (-0.5445, 2.1445)
           
           For `#o1` (ray for communications):
           - `(v14, v9)`: from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `v9_center` (-1.9, -2.0)
           
           Since the `ray` objects (like `#o4` and `#o1`) are separate, we would need to specify values for these rays if they are distinct in the plan. However, the initial state has `ray(#o4)` and `ray(#o1)` as single objects. This suggests that the same ray `#o4` is used for all imagevisible predicates, and `#o1` for all comvisible predicates.
           This is again a PDDL ambiguity. The problem statement says: "you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair". But the ray is the 3rd argument, not the 2nd argument. And `ray(#o4)` is not `conf(#o4, v14)`. So the `#o4` and `#o1` ray names will be used as given. We just need to define the x,y coordinates for the configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`.
           
           Given the constraint that `v14` cannot move from `v15` and `v12` cannot move from `v13`, and the initial state asserts visibility for all relevant `(rover, target)` pairs using `#o0, #o3, #o5` configurations, these `#o` configuration parameters must refer to the current locations `v15` or `v13`. If they don't, the plan is impossible due to lack of `move` actions. I will proceed with the assumption that `#o0` (for `v14`), `#o3` (for `v14`), and `#o5` (for `v14`) all map to `v15`'s coordinates.
           
           Let's pick two rocks: `v1` (type `v2` / stone) and `v5` (type `v6` / soil).
           `type(v1, v2)` (stone)
           `type(v5, v6)` (soil)

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The provided list of valid actions only contains `move` and `drop_rock` actions. The `move` actions are identity moves, meaning the rovers cannot actually change their configuration from their initial states (`v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14`). The `drop_rock` actions allow freeing up the storage, but do not contribute to the goal of `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires `receivedimage` for four objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`) and `receivedanalysis` for a rock of type `v2` and a rock of type `v6`.
           The actions required to achieve these goals are `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. None of these actions are present in the provided list of valid actions.
           
           Since the necessary actions to achieve the goal (`calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`) are not in the list of valid actions, it is impossible to achieve the goal with the given set of allowed actions.
