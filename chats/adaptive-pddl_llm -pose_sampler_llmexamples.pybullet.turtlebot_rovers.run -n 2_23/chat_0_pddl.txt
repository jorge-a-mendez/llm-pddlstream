           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers (v12 and v14), a lander (v9), a camera (v10), a store (v16), and several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and objectives (v17, v18). Both rovers are at their initial configurations (v12 at v13, v14 at v15) and both have a free store v16. The camera v10 is onboard both rovers and supports mode v11. The goal is to satisfy axiom new-axiom@0, which requires several conditions to be met simultaneously:
           - Both rovers must be at their configurations (`atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`). These are already true in the initial state.
           - Both rovers must have a free store (`free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`). These are already true.
           - Images of both objectives (v17 and v18) in mode v11 must be received (`receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`).
           - Rocks of type v2 (v1, v3, v4) must be analyzed and the analysis received (`receivedanalysis(v1)`, `receivedanalysis(v3)`, `receivedanalysis(v4)`).
           - Rocks of type v6 (v5, v7, v8) must be analyzed and the analysis received (`receivedanalysis(v5)`, `receivedanalysis(v7)`, `receivedanalysis(v8)`).
           
           However, the only available actions are `move` and `drop_rock`.
           The `move` actions simply move the rovers from their current configuration to the same configuration, which doesn't change anything relevant to the goal.
           The `drop_rock` actions require a full store, but both stores are currently free. So these actions cannot be executed.
           
           There are no actions available to take images, calibrate cameras, send images, sample rocks, or send analysis. Therefore, the conditions regarding received images and received analysis cannot be met with the given allowed actions.
           
           Since the goal requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates to be true, and there are no actions to achieve these predicates, the goal is unreachable.
           
           The goal is not achievable with the given set of allowed actions, as there are no actions that can produce the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
