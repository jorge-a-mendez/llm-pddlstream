(Thoughts: **Fulfilling the Request for 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My primary goal is to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 10) with dimensions roughly 0.0937 x 0.0937, on a given surface (surface 0: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))). Stability, in this context, means the object must be fully contained within the surface's boundaries after any rotation. I am working under the assumption that other objects are not yet placed.
           
           Given the object is close to a square, the effective dimensions (width and height) after rotation will change very little, and will be roughly 0.0937. The surface is a rectangle 0.6x0.6. This large ratio suggests numerous valid placement options.
           
           My approach will be as follows:
           
           1.  **Select Surface:** Since only one surface is available (surface 0), I will place all objects on that surface.
           
           2.  **Define Rotation Angles:** I will use two primary angles for rotation `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/2` to give the object two major orientations.
           
           3.  **Calculate Effective Dimensions:** I will compute the effective bounding box of the object for each rotation angle. For `theta = 0`, the effective width and height are the original dimensions (obj_w, obj_h). For `theta = pi/2`, the effective width and height are swapped.
           
           4.  **Determine Valid Center Ranges:** For each rotation, I will calculate the allowed `x` and `y` center coordinates. I must make sure the object remains inside of surface 0.
               *   `x_min_center = surface_lower_x + effective_w / 2`
               *   `x_max_center = surface_upper_x - effective_w / 2`
               *   `y_min_center = surface_lower_y + effective_h / 2`
               *   `y_max_center = surface_upper_y - effective_h / 2`
           
           5.  **Generate Placements:** To ensure 50 unique placements, I will create a 5x5 grid of `x` and `y` coordinates for both `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/2`. This will result in 25 placements per rotation angle, making the total count 50.
           
               I will use the following formulas to generate the x and y coordinates:
           
               *x\_coord = x\_min\_center + i \* (x\_max\_center - x\_min\_center) / (num\_x\_points - 1) * where i = 0,1,2,3,4.
               *y\_coord = y\_min\_center + i \* (y\_max\_center - y\_min\_center) / (num\_y\_points - 1) * where i = 0,1,2,3,4.
           
               By combining the rotations with center coordinates, I will generate a list of `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)` tuples and stop when 50 placements are obtained.

               By combining the rotations with center coordinates, I will generate a list of `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)` tuples and stop when 50 placements are obtained.
