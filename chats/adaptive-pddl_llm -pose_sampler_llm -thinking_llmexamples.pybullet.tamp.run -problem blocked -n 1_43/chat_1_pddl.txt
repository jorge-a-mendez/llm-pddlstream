           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **A Deep Dive into an Unachievable Goal**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object, `?green`, both "on" a specific object (`v18`) and of a particular "type" (`v17`). Upon examining the initial state, I've identified two potential candidates for `?green`: `v8` and `v12`. Both are of type `v17` and are "stackable" with `v18`. Selecting `v8` for now, the primary challenge becomes achieving `on(v8, v18)`.
           
           To unpack this, I need to find a way to make `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)` true. Currently, `v8` is on `v11`. However, there is a valid pose, `#o2`, for `v8` on `v18`. This hints that I will need to move `v8` to that location using `pick` and `place`.
           
           The process starts with picking up `v8`, which sets the hand to empty, and ends with placing it on `v18`. However, I have a problem! The problem specifies that *only* the single action `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))` is allowed. This fundamentally restricts my ability to perform pick-and-place actions, which are necessary to change the position of objects.
           
           The `move_base` action, in this specific instance, results in the robot's `atbconf` remaining unchanged and the robot's ability to `canmove()` becoming false. Neither are useful for moving the required objects into position.
           
           Since the allowed actions don't permit picking and placing, and the goal requires moving objects into the target position to satisfy `on(?green, v18)` , I must conclude the goal is not achievable.
