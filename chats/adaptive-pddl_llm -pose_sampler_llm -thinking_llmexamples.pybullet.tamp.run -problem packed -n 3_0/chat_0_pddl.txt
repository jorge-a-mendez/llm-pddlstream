(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object 5 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to generate 50 stable placements for object ID 5, a square with dimensions (0.09094, 0.09094), on a single rectangular surface, AABB `0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  I need to determine `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)` for each placement.  Since the object is square, I will leverage the symmetry, considering the object's rotation (theta) in increments of 90 degrees (pi/2).
           
           The surface AABB has width and height of 0.270. Object 5 has a side length of approximately 0.09094.  To ensure stability, the object's center cannot be too close to the edge. The critical parameter for this is the object's half-width or half-height when placed at the most restrictive rotation, where its effective bounding box is largest.  For a square, this maximum effective bounding box occurs when rotated at pi/4 radians.  In this case, the effective width and height are `S * sqrt(2)`, which is approximately 0.1286. With this rotation I calculated a conservative safe area by limiting the object’s center position to a square area within the surface, this area has approximately 0.1414 width and height centered at (0,0).  The x and y center coordinates, therefore, have safe bounds of approximately -0.0707 to 0.0707.
           
           To achieve diversity in my placements, I'll use a 4x4 grid of (x, y) coordinates within this safe area, resulting in 16 positions.  The x and y coordinates are:  -0.070697, -0.02356566666666667, 0.02356566666666667, 0.070697.
           
           I will then apply four distinct rotation angles (theta): 0, pi/4, pi/2, and 3*pi/4, ensuring diverse orientations. I will use the first 16 combinations for `theta=0`, the next 16 for `theta=pi/4`, and the next 16 for `theta=pi/2`. Finally, the remaining two spots I will use with `theta=3*pi/4`, giving 4 different (x,y) pairs for that angle.
           
           In all cases, I'm setting the `surf_idx` to 0, which refers to the surface the placements are on. I anticipate that the placement solution I provide here is stable, given that all rotations fit within the surface. If this isn't the case in practice, I will need to consider that, and potentially the interpretation of the bounding box.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Avoiding Collisions**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new task: placing a square object (ID 4) on a surface while avoiding a pre-placed object (ID 5).  I remember that object 5's placement is stable (0, 0.0, -0.07069699999999999, -0.07069699999999999) and doesn't collide with anything fixed. This is crucial for avoiding collisions later! The new object is a square of side 0.08126121116720625.
           
           **My Approach:** I'm going to calculate the valid placement area for the new object on surface 0, making sure it won't collide with object 5. My surface is a square of side 0.270 centered at (0,0). I will:
           
           1.  **Define Placement Limits:**
               *   **Surface Bounds:** I'll calculate the maximum allowable extent for the square on the surface, taking into account the rotation. This means I need to calculate the *effective* side length when it's rotated. This gets me the maximum possible area it can take up
               *   **Rotating:** For a square, I know that at 45 degree rotations, I must use a conservative estimate to ensure no collision at any rotation. This is my effective side length. Half the side length, and I get an allowed region.
               *   This gets me the possible region to place the center of the object.
           
           2.  **Define Object 5's Bounding Box (AABB):** Because Object 5 is fixed at position -0.07, I can now set up its AABB to detect collisions. This is important: to get a quick estimate of collisions I will not be performing the complicated SAT algorithm but will stick to these AABB estimates.
           
           3.  **Generate and Check Placements:**
               *   **Grid and Theta:** I will use a simple grid of x and y coordinates on the surface, and also I will use a set of rotations of 0, 45, 90, 135.
               *   **Collision Detection:** Then, for each possible placement (x,y,theta), I'll calculate object 4's AABB (considering its rotation). Then, compare the new AABB with object 5's AABB.
               *   **Filtering:** I will check for AABB overlap.
               *   **If no overlap**, I will add it to the list of good placement.
           
               This ensures that the new object does not collide at any rotation, which is important to me because the objects might get rotated.
           
               To be efficient in avoiding overlaps, I will check the placement bounds, and then use the AABB estimates to filter out the possibilities.
           
               The good news is that I have a successful placement! And this ensures that I won't have any collisions.
           
           *   **Grid size** - to get 50 possible positions, I will space the grid out appropriately, with 4 steps in both X and Y.
           *   **AABB collision checks** - will use all the dimensions to accurately estimate collisions, and ensure no objects will be placed on top of one another.
           *   The goal - get 50 different positions.

(Thoughts: **My Primary Objective: Find 50 Stable Placements**
           
           I need to place Object 6 on Surface 0, avoiding collisions with Object 5 and the successful placements of Object 4, which I'll treat as fixed obstacles. I know the surface dimensions and the bounding box (AABB) information for each obstacle.  Object 6 is a square; its side length, `S_6`, is known. I will generate a set of candidate placements by considering a grid of X and Y coordinates on Surface 0 with some rotation angles (0, 45, 90, 135 degrees) to find all possible stable placements.
           
           Given the surface dimensions `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`, I've calculated the boundaries within which Object 6's center must lie to fit: `x_min_center_6 = -0.076748`, `x_max_center_6 = 0.076748`, and the same for Y. My plan is to discretize this space for X and Y coordinates, resulting in a grid of potential centers. I'm going to set up my grid by using a step size of `0.038374`
           
           I know that to find a stable placement, I must have no collisions with the obstacles (AABBs). Since the Object 6's shape is a square, the effective dimensions (specifically for an angle of 45-degree rotation), are needed and will be part of the AABB calculations. I've prepared a way to check if an AABB with known dimensions collides with another AABB. If they do, that placement is discarded. I am also aware that when rotating by 45 degrees, the effective side of the square increases to `S_6 * sqrt(2)`.
           
           I am also keenly aware that the fixed obstacles, especially Object 5 and the two placements of Object 4, occupy a significant portion of the lower-left area of Surface 0. Because of this, placements in the bottom-left of the surface have a high probability of collision, and I will be looking mostly at the upper and right portions of the surface for good, safe placements of Object 6.
