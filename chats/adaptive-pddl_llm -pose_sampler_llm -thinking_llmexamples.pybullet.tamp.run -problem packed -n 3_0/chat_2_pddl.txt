(Thoughts: **A Concise Strategy for Stacking Three Objects**
           
           Okay, here's my game plan to achieve the goal: place objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto surface `v16`. I'm starting with a detailed analysis of the initial state, which is full of facts about object poses, grasp points, and the robot's current configuration. My key observation is that all the objects are currently resting on surface `v11`, but I need them on `v16`. I also see that there is a pose, denoted as `#o2`, where all of the objects could be placed onto `v16`.
           
           My strategy will be straightforward: I'll use the available robot arm, `v4`, to pick up each object individually from its current position on `v11` and carefully place it at `#o2` on `v16`. Before I do any picking and placing, I need to make sure the robot is at base configuration `#o3` because, from the initial state analysis, all of the relevant pick and place operations require this configuration. So, my first step is to move the robot's base from its current position, `v3`, to the required `#o3`.
           
           Then, I'll go through each of the objects. For `v8`, I'll use the grasping configuration `#o1` to pick it up from pose `v9`. After that, I'll carefully place it down at `#o2` on surface `v16`.  I'll repeat this exact process for `v12` (initial pose `v13`) and `v14` (initial pose `v15`), ensuring I pick them up from their current pose and place them at pose `#o2` on `v16`.
           
           I have to be careful with the preconditions of my actions, specifically those regarding safety. The problem statement says any fact not explicitly stated in the initial state is false. Since there are no safety facts like `unsafeapproach` explicitly stated, I can safely assume that the preconditions for picking up and placing the objects are satisfied. This allows me to move forward with the planning process.
           
           I will use facts like *kin*, *basemotion*, *grasp*, *pose*, and *supported* to perform the plan.
           
           This sequence of actions should allow me to achieve the goal efficiently, ensuring each object is stacked correctly on surface `v16`.
           
           Here's the planned sequence:
           
           1.  **Move base:** Move robot base from v3 to #o3.
           2.  **Pick v8:** Pick up `v8` from pose `v9`.
           3.  **Place v8:** Place `v8` at pose `#o2` on `v16`.
           4.  **Pick v12:** Pick up `v12` from pose `v13`.
           5.  **Place v12:** Place `v12` at pose `#o2` on `v16`.
           6.  **Pick v14:** Pick up `v14` from pose `v15`.
           7.  **Place v14:** Place `v14` at pose `#o2` on `v16`.
