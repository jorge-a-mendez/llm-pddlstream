           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My thought process in tackling this planning problem began with a focused analysis of the goal `new-axiom@0()`.**  I immediately recognized two axioms with that name, one with a parameter and one without, a confusing detail.  The goal, based on the zero-arity axiom, seemed to require making `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` true. I looked for an object meeting these criteria, and quickly found `v12` already had the right type. The plan seemed simple: put `v12` on `v18`.
           
           The solution plan, therefore, would be to get v12 on v18.
           
           Initially, I devised a plan involving picking `v12` and placing it on `v18`.  I traced the required preconditions for `move_base`, `pick`, and `place` actions, and step-by-step verified the plan. However, a major hurdle surfaced when examining the `pick` action's precondition: `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)`.  This axiom, defined in a particularly tricky way, meant the `pick` was possible *only* if `new-axiom@0(?o)` was *false*.
           
           I then thoroughly analyzed the axiom `new-axiom@0(?o)` which states `EXISTS ?culprit (graspable(?culprit) AND ?culprit != ?o)`. This boils down to "there must exist a graspable object other than the one we are about to pick".  In the initial state, *both* `v12` and `v15` are graspable! This makes `new-axiom@0(v12)` *true*, invalidating the `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(v12)` precondition and effectively blocking the `pick` action for `v12`.
           
           I exhaustively reviewed the domain for actions that could modify the 'graspable' property or achieve the goal indirectly.  However, no such action exists, I then reviewed the context again for some hidden action to modify those properties, but the facts, `graspable(v12)` and `graspable(v15)`, remain true.
           
           With pick off the table, the plan, therefore, is impossible.
           
           It became painfully clear that due to the structure of `new-axiom@0(?o)` and the existing graspable objects, the pick and place approach was fundamentally blocked. The goal `new-axiom@0()` (0-arity) requires `on(X, v18)` and `type(X, v17)`. The only possible `X` I found was `v12`. But moving `v12` needs picking.  But picking `v12` is impossible. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.  I carefully checked the domain actions, preconditions, and effects, making sure I hadn't overlooked an alternative, but my conclusion remains: this goal is not achievable given the current conditions.
           
           My analysis has led me to conclude that this planning problem is unsolvable.
