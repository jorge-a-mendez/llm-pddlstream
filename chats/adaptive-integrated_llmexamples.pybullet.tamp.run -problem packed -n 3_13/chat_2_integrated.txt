           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.092, -0.236, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.892, -0.452).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.216, -0.247), (0.297, -0.166)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.079, 0.209), (0.163, 0.293)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.256, -0.207, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.087, 0.996).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.141, -0.285), (-0.043, -0.187)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.121, 0.251, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.782, 0.623).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, and two surfaces: `v11` and `v16`. `v10` is another surface that can support objects, but has no specific AABB, so we'll treat it as a dummy surface. The goal is to place all three objects (`v8`, `v12`, and `v14`) on `v16`. Currently, `v8` is on `v11` at `v9`, `v12` is on `v11` at `v13`, and `v14` is on `v11` at `v15`. The robot arm `v4` is currently empty and at `v5`, and the base is at `v3`.
           
           The plan involves picking each object from its initial pose on `v11` and placing it on `v16` at a new pose represented by `#o2`. Since the robot needs to move to a base configuration `bconf(#o3)` for picking and placing, and then back to `v3` for potential further moves, `move_base` actions will be necessary. However, the cost of moving the base is based on distance, and all relevant actions for picking and placing use the same base configuration `#o3` and initial base configuration `v3`. Since the base does not need to move to different locations to pick/place the objects from/to a different surface, the cost of the `move_base` actions between `v3` and `#o3` should be minimal. We can optimize by moving the base to `#o3` once, performing all picks and places, and then potentially moving back to `v3` if needed for future tasks (though not strictly necessary for this goal).
           
           The core of the plan will be:
           1. Move the base from `v3` to `#o3`.
           2. Pick `v8` from `v9` (on `v11`).
           3. Place `v8` at `#o2` (on `v16`).
           4. Pick `v12` from `v13` (on `v11`).
           5. Place `v12` at `#o2` (on `v16`).
           6. Pick `v14` from `v15` (on `v11`).
           7. Place `v14` at `#o2` (on `v16`).
           
           For step 1, `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` is used. This action generates a `btraj` object `#o0` which is then used by the `basemotion` predicates.
           Since all the target poses for `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are `#o2`, we must ensure that each object is placed at a *distinct* collision-free pose on `v16`. We need to provide three different values for `#o2` based on the object being placed on `v16`. We will place the objects in sequence, meaning only one object will be at `#o2` at a time before the next object is picked. We will need to define a slightly different `#o2` for each object to satisfy the "on" condition for all objects on `v16`. However, the PDDL description indicates that `#o2` refers to a single pose that can be taken by multiple objects. We must choose collision-free poses for each object when it is placed, while considering the AABBs of the objects. Since `v16` is a square of `0.27 x 0.27`, we need to place the objects such that they don't overlap when all are on `v16`. Since all objects are relatively small, we can place them side by side on `v16`.
           
           The plan below assumes that the continuous parameter `#o3` for the base configuration is the same for all pick and place actions, and the continuous parameter `#o4` for the arm trajectory is also the same. The objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14` are to be placed on `v16`. The AABB for `v16` is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           For `v8` (AABB: `((0.216, -0.247), (0.297, -0.166))`), `v12` (AABB: `((-0.141, -0.285), (-0.043, -0.187))`), and `v14` (AABB: `((0.079, 0.209), (0.163, 0.293))`), we will place them on `v16` (AABB: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`). We need to ensure that the objects are within the bounds of `v16`. Since the AABBs for the objects are given relative to their own frames, we need to choose placement positions on `v16` such that the bounding box of the object at that position is entirely within `v16`. Assuming the object's origin is at its center, for an object with a width `w` and height `h`, placed at `(x, y)` relative to the center of `v16`, the object occupies `[x - w/2, x + w/2]` and `[y - h/2, y + h/2]`. The `v16` surface is centered at `(0,0)` if we take the coordinate system where its bounds are `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           Let's estimate the dimensions of the objects from their AABBs:
           - `v8`: width = 0.297 - 0.216 = 0.081, height = -0.166 - (-0.247) = 0.081. (Note: These AABBs seem to be in global coordinates and not relative to the object's origin for the object type `object` and are not standard). For `pose` coordinates (x, y), these correspond to the location of the object. We will pick poses on `v16` that are within its bounds and are separated. We'll use a `z` value that is typical for objects on a surface, e.g., 0.781 (from existing poses).
           
           Let's try to place them at the following (x,y) on `v16` (relative to the center of `v16`):
           1. `v8`: (-0.08, 0.0)
           2. `v12`: (0.0, 0.08)
           3. `v14`: (0.0, -0.08)
           
           The poses must be provided relative to the world frame. Assuming `v16` is centered at `(0,0,0.781)` and has the given dimensions. We can translate this to:
           - For `v8`: pose(-0.08, 0.0, 0.781, 0)
           - For `v12`: pose(0.0, 0.08, 0.781, 0)
           - For `v14`: pose(0.0, -0.08, 0.781, 0)
           
           These coordinate values for the poses will be used for `#o2`. The problem statement says if multiple objects use `#o2`, we must provide a different continuous value for *each* object at that pose. This implies that the same symbolic `#o2` can represent multiple distinct continuous values depending on the object.
