User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.079, 0.209), (0.163, 0.293)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.256, -0.207, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.087, 0.996).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.092, -0.236, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.892, -0.452).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.121, 0.251, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.782, 0.623).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.216, -0.247), (0.297, -0.166)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.141, -0.285), (-0.043, -0.187)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom stackable(v14, v16)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)
           Atom graspable(v14)

           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)

           Atom supported(v14, v15, v11)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom stackable(v14, v10)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable objects: v8, v12, and v14. They are currently located at poses v9, v13, and v15, respectively, all supported by v11. The goal is to place all three objects on v16. There is only one base motion available, which is a self-loop from v3 to v3 with trajectory #o0, incurring no cost.
           
           The plan involves picking up each object from its current location and placing it on v16 at a new pose. Since all objects need to be placed on v16 and all have #o2 as a possible pose on v16, we will need to provide three distinct continuous values for #o2, one for each object.
           
           Since there are no pick or place actions provided in the action instance list, it is impossible to achieve the goal of moving objects from their current location to v16.
           
           The goal is to have objects v8, v12, and v14 on v16. However, there are no valid `pick` or `place` action instances provided in the problem description. The only action instance available is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which does not alter the state of the objects or their locations. Therefore, it is impossible to move any of the objects to v16 and achieve the goal.
