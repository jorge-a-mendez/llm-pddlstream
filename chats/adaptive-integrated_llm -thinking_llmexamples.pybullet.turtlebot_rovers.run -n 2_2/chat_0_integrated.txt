           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Finalized Plan for new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, let's break this down from a planning perspective. My primary goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. This translates to satisfying a conjunction of several predicates: capturing images of objectives, receiving analyses of stones and soil, all within the constraints of my current state.
           
           First, I identified the main subgoals: getting images of `v17` and `v18` with mode `v11`, and receiving analyses for stones and soil. The initial state analysis revealed that I'm already in a good spot for some predicates, but need to work on others.  I'm already at configurations `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`.  `v12` is at `v13`, and `v14` is at `v15`. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are also true.
           
           I have rovers `v12` and `v14` which are onboard with cameras (camera `v10`). My problem is that I cannot move to different configurations because the given actions are only no-ops, which are of the form `move v12 v13 #o2 v13` where the agent stays in its current configuration. This means my planned actions must be executed at existing configurations, specifically `v13` or `v15`.
           
           **Here's the detailed plan:**
           
           **Rover v12 (at v13) for Imaging:**
           
           1.  **Calibrate Camera (for Objective v18):**  `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v18, v10)`.  To satisfy `calibrate` with a configuration `#o3`,  I must set `#o3`'s location. Given my constraints, I'm setting `#o3` to be the current configuration of rover `v12`, which is `v13`. I'm trusting that `imagevisible(v12, v13, #o4, v18)` is a valid statement in the initial state.
           2.  **Take Image (of v18):** `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`. Again, the configuration is `#o3`, which will be `v13`.
           3.  **Calibrate Camera (for Objective v17):** `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)`. Since I'm using `v12`, with an impossible move, I set  `#o3` to `v13` here as well.
           4.  **Take Image (of v17):** `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`. The configuration again is  `#o3`, interpreted as the current position `v13`.
           5.  **Send Image (v18):** `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`.  For this action to be possible, I require `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`.  To satisfy `comvisible`, I set the `#o0` parameter as the current configuration, which is the same as `v13`.
           6.  **Send Image (v17):** `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`.  Again, I set `#o0` to `v13`, the current configuration of `v12`, such that I can use `comvisible(v12, v13, #o1, v9)`.
           
           **Rover v14 (at v15) for Analyzing:**
           
           7.  **Sample Rock:**  `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v4, v16)`.  To satisfy this, I must be `above(v14, #o5, v4)`, and the store `v16` must be free.  I am assuming, as stated in the problem statement that  `above(v14, #o5, v4)` implies a valid configuration in the initial state, given no moves available. Since rover `v14` is in configuration `v15`, for a valid interpretation, I *must* set `#o5` to `v15`.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10) , (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11) , (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10) , (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11) , (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11) , (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11) , (sample_rock v14 #o5 v4 v16) , (send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v4) , (sample_rock v14 #o5 v8 v16) , (send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v8)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Goal Reachability with Restricted Actions**
           
           Okay, I've got a problem. The agent's actions are severely limited.  I've been given a list of valid actions, and my previous plan utilized actions outside this list. Now, I can only use `move` (self-loop) and `drop_rock`.  Let's re-evaluate the target goal `new-axiom@0()` given these constraints.
           
           The goal consists of several conditions: being "at configuration" for two rovers (`atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`), having the stores "free" (`free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)`), and receiving images and analyses (`receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, and analyses of some stone and soil).
           
           The initial state already satisfies the "at configuration" and "free" conditions.  The `move` actions simply reinforce those truths; they are essentially no-ops in terms of state change. I can't even get to the point of sampling rocks because the `drop_rock` action requires that the store be "full." However, there are no actions to fill the store with sampled rocks in the valid action list.
           
           Critically, there are no actions to send images or analyses. These are effects of `send_image` and `send_analysis`, respectively, which are not allowed.  Therefore, I'm stuck: the goal conditions related to images and analyses are completely unachievable.
           
           Since the goal requires *all* of its constituent conditions to be true, and I cannot achieve the image and analysis components, the overall goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable with the given restricted action set. The agent is in a constrained state.
