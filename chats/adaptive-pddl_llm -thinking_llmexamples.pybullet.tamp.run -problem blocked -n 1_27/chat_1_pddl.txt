           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Goal and Constraints**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to ensuring that an object (let's call it `?green`) is both `on v18` and has a specific `type` (represented by `v17`). The initial state provides two potential candidates for `?green`: `v8` and `v12`, both sharing the desired `type`.
           
           To satisfy `on(?green, v18)`, I need the `?green` object to be both `supported` by `v18` and in the correct `atpose`.  Looking at the initial state, I see both `v8` and `v12` are already supported by `v18` (via the pose `#o2`), but crucially, neither is *currently* at pose `#o2`. `v8` is at pose `v9` and `v12` is at pose `v13`.
           
           **Action Availability and Limitations**
           
           Now, the real kicker: I'm severely restricted in the actions I can take. The "valid action instances" only give me the `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` option. This means the robot can *only* "move base" from its current configuration `v3` to the same configuration `v3` using trajectory `#o0`.  This particular action doesn't allow me to pick up and place objects to change their pose and `on` status.
           
           **Impossibility of Goal Achievement**
           
           Since I lack the essential `pick` and `place` actions needed to modify the object's `atpose` (and subsequently, its `on` status), and the sole available action (`move_base`) is irrelevant to object manipulation, I conclude that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently *unachievable* given the constraints of the initial state and the limited set of available actions. I cannot change the `on` status of any object with this constraint, therefore, the goal is unreachable.
