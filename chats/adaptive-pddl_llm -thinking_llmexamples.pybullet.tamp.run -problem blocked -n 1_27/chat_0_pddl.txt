           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom graspable(v15)
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)

           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)

           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Problem and Constraints**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: `new-axiom@0()`, which I understand means I need to make an object that's the right "type" be placed "on" a specific target. The axioms tell me that "on" means supported by a certain object and in the right pose. Looking at the initial state, I see I have some objects that *could* be the right "type," specifically `v8` and `v12`. I need to figure out how to get one of them on `v18`.
           
           My initial thought is, how do I move these objects? I know they're currently "on" other objects (`v11` and `v14` respectively). To get them on `v18`, I'd normally think of using `pick` and `place` actions to change their pose.
           
           However, here's where it gets tricky: I'm only *allowed* to use `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. That's it! Looking at this `move_base` action, it *appears* to be a no-op, meaning it doesn't actually move any objects. It primarily modifies the `canmove()` predicate. This limitation is a showstopper.
           
           **The Impossibility of Achieving the Goal**
           
           The crux of the matter is this: to achieve the "on" condition, I *need* to change the `atpose` of either `v8` or `v12`. But I can't do that with just `move_base`. Without being able to change the pose, I'm stuck with what I have. There is no way I can manipulate objects within the allowed action and achieve the goal. No matter how I twist and turn this, the specific `move_base` action just doesn't provide the ability to change `atpose`.
           
           **Conclusion**
           
           I've carefully considered the possible scenarios. Given the constraints and the nature of the available action, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is *unachievable*. It's impossible to manipulate the object's pose, the prerequisite to satisfy the "on" predicate and to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` condition. The provided action `move_base v3 v3 #o0` is an identity action, it's a useless action that does nothing towards the objective of this task.
