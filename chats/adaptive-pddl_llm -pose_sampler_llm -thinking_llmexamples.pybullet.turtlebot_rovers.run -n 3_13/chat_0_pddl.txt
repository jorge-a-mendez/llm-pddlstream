           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Final Plan and Reasoning**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, considering that the rovers are essentially fixed at their initial configurations due to the lack of movement actions.  I've reasoned through this carefully, assuming the continuous parameters can be instantiated to the current rover positions.
           
           My main thought process was to first break down the goal `new-axiom@0()` into its sub-goals.  It needs `receivedimage` for objectives v17, v18, and v19, and `receivedanalysis` for one rock of type v2 and one of type v6.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`, I'll need to use actions to calibrate the camera, take an image, and send it. Similarly, `receivedanalysis` requires sampling a rock and then sending the analysis.
           
           The main challenge I faced was that the rovers `v12` and `v14` are "stuck" at configurations `v13` and `v15` respectively, with only self-move actions. This means any action that requires a rover to be *at* a different configuration is *impossible*. If I did not assume that `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` are implicitly equal to the rovers' current location during action execution, this problem would have been unsolvable.
           
           Given this constraint, I decided to focus on using `v12` at `v13` because the camera and other relevant objects are associated with this rover for actions.  Here's the plan I've come up with. It's a sequence of actions that, under the assumption that the continuous parameters are effectively the current configurations, should satisfy all the sub-goals.
           
           1.  **Calibrate** the camera (v10) for objective v17 at v13: `calibrate(v12, v13, #o4, v17, v10)`.
           
           2.  **Take** an image of v17 at v13: `take_image(v12, v13, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`.
           
           3.  **Send** the image of v17 to the lander (v9) at v13: `send_image(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`.
           
           4.  **Repeat steps 1-3** for objective v18, starting from calibrating for v18.
           
           5.  **Repeat steps 1-3** for objective v19, starting from calibrating for v19.
           
           6.  **Sample** the rock (v1), which is a type v2 rock, and store the sample in the rover's store (v16): `sample_rock(v12, v13, v1, v16)`.
           
           7.  **Send** the analysis of the rock (v1) to the lander: `send_analysis(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v1)`.
           
           8.  **Drop** the sampled rock from the rover's store: `drop_rock(v12, v16)`.
           
           9.  **Sample** the rock (v8), which is a type v6 rock and is the second type of analysis requested. We will use the store that was emptied in the last step: `sample_rock(v12, v13, v8, v16)`.
           
           10. **Send** the analysis of the rock (v8): `send_analysis(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v8)`.
           
           This plan covers all the necessary actions, assuming the continuous parameters can be treated as if they refer to the rover's current state. No movement occurs. All preconditions check out.

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Goal Achievability**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a new problem, and unfortunately, it looks like my previous attempt didn't quite cut it. The user rightly pointed out that I strayed from the provided list of *valid action instances*. That's a fundamental error on my part. I need to work within the constraints.
           
           My primary task now is to determine if the goal, `Atom new-axiom@0()`, is achievable from the initial state, given these valid actions:
           
           1.  `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`
           2.  `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`
           3.  `(drop_rock v12 v16)`
           4.  `(drop_rock v14 v16)`
           
           The goal is quite elaborate, but upon inspection, a significant portion is already satisfied in the initial state. Specifically, the following are already true: `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, and `free(v14, v16)`.
           
           That leaves the following predicates that I need to satisfy:
           * `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           * `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           * `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           * `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for a rock of type `v2`
           * `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for a rock of type `v6`
           
           Now, let's carefully evaluate the impact of each of the allowed actions. The `move` actions seem irrelevant to the remaining goal clauses, as they only reassert existing `atconf` facts. The `drop_rock` actions have preconditions that are not met in the initial state. Since both locations are initially `free` rather than `full`.
           
           Examining the goal, I realized that getting `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` is critical. To achieve these, I would typically use `take_image` and `send_image` for images, and `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` for the analysis. However, none of these actions are in the provided list.
           
           Therefore, given the available actions, there's no way to reach the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. I'm forced to conclude that, based on the problem statement, the goal is simply *not achievable* with the provided set of actions. This is unfortunate, as I have no suitable plan to generate, it is a problem constraint.
