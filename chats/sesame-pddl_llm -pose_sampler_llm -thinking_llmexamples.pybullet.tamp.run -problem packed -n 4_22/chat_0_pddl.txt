(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation for Object ID 6**
           
           My goal is to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 6) on a given surface. The surface is a square centered at the origin, with bounds from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). The object's dimensions are almost perfectly square: size_x = 0.09316991543906566 and size_y = 0.09316991543906572.  A placement is defined by (surf_idx, theta, x, y), where surf_idx is the surface index (0 in this case), theta is the rotation angle, and (x, y) are the coordinates of the object's center.  Stability requires the object to be fully contained within the surface bounds.
           
           First, I calculate the object's half-extents, hx and hy, which are half of size_x and size_y respectively. Since these values are nearly identical, I can make a simplifying assumption:  I approximate hx and hy using their average, h_avg.  This allows me to significantly simplify the calculation of the rotated AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) dimensions. The main goal here is to get 50 diverse placements that fit.
           
           For a given rotation angle, theta, the effective half-extents of the rotated AABB are calculated. The general formulae are `hw_rot = abs(hx * cos(theta)) + abs(hy * sin(theta))` and `hh_rot = abs(hx * sin(theta)) + abs(hy * cos(theta))`. However, the near-square object allows a critical simplification. Since hx and hy are practically equal, the expressions for `hw_rot` and `hh_rot`  become approximately the same, so I can use a combined effective extent `h_eff = h_avg * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.  This greatly simplifies the calculation of the bounds.
           
           With this, I generate 50 placements.
           Here's how I vary placement: I first vary theta from 0 to 2*pi in 50 equal steps. For each rotation `theta`, I then pick the x, y center of the placement. I set factors x_factor, y_factor from [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0] to place the object centers evenly across the allowed region within the surface bounds.
           This gives me 5 different `x, y` within the bounds.
           So, the surface bounds ([-0.135, -0.135], [0.135, 0.135]) and the object’s rotation are used to calculate where the center of the object can be.
           
           Now, I calculate the valid range for the object's center (x, y) given theta. The range for x is [surf_min_x + h_eff, surf_max_x - h_eff] and the range for y is [surf_min_y + h_eff, surf_max_y - h_eff]. The factors x_factor and y_factor are multiplied by this range and added to the minimum to find x and y.
           
           The results are:

(Thoughts: **Collision-Free Placement Strategy for Object 4**
           
           Alright, I've got the feedback: object ID 6 is placed, and now I need to figure out where to put object ID 4 without any collisions, especially avoiding that already-placed object 6. I've got the dimensions and know the rules: keep it stable, and no overlapping. The key is surface 0 and remembering the constraint of no collision between objects.
           
           First, I've got to define what I'm working with. Object 6 is set with size, half-extents, and an orientation of 0. That's a rectangle in the bottom-left corner of the surface:  `[-0.135, -0.04183] x [-0.135, -0.04183]`. Then, there's object 4, the new one, with its size and half-extents. It's a square too.  Now, the surface bounds are fixed: `[-0.135, 0.135] x [-0.135, 0.135]`.
           
           To place object 4, I'll consider rotation (theta) and its center position (x, y). Each `theta` yields different rotated AABB bounds for checking collisions. I'll need to account for object 4's rotation, and the overlap condition which I defined as having the form `(max_x_4 < min_x_6)` OR `(min_x_4 > max_x_6)` OR `(max_y_4 < min_y_6)` OR `(min_y_4 > max_y_6)`.
           
           My initial idea is placing `theta_4 = 0`. This makes calculations simpler. I calculated the bounds for the center position to avoid collisions on the surface, and determined the constraints: object 6's AABB is  `[-0.135, -0.04183]` and object 4 would not overlap if `(x > 0.00689)` or `(y > 0.00689)`. I also determined object 4's bounds.
           
           Now, I'll need to generate a diverse set of 50 placements, considering rotation angles and surface constraints. I'll need to calculate `hw_rot` and `hh_rot` for each rotation.
           
           So, for all angles, I'll check if they are within surface bounds and collision-free to create diverse positions. I will iterate `theta` from `0` to `2 * pi`, and for each angle, calculate `hw_rot` and `hh_rot`, determine surface constraints. And, since I know that it is in the bottom left,  I'll place object 4 in the upper right.  `x_safe_start = x_6_max + hw_rot`, `y_safe_start = y_6_max + hh_rot`. I'll set a point (0.04, 0.04) and re-check if it's collision-free, using bounds.
           
           I'll check the bounds that I've used as a safe start. The result will provide 50 collision-free placements on the surface for object 4.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for a New Object**
           
           I need to place a new object (ID 5) on surface 0, avoiding collisions with two existing objects (ID 4 and ID 6), while aiming for 50 stable placements. Object 5 has equal x and y dimensions (meaning it's square), which simplifies some calculations. The approach involves iterating through different object orientations (theta) and testing for collisions across the available surface area.
           
           First, I need to define the surface bounds and identify the fixed obstacles. The surface area on which to place new objects is a square with coordinates: x between -0.135 and 0.135, and y also between -0.135 and 0.135. Object 6's AABB is approximately [-0.135, -0.042] x [-0.135, -0.042], while Object 4's AABB is [-0.041, 0.056] x [-0.041, 0.056]. These AABBs partially overlap, but I treat them independently.
           
           For each tested theta, I calculate the effective half-width of the object, which is identical to its half-height because it's square, considering the object's rotation using the formula involving cosine and sine of the angle. I then define the safe placement region within the surface by the effective bounding box. Then I calculate the allowable x and y.
           
           To check for collision, I'll iterate through `theta` in `[0, 2 * pi]`, generate candidate placement points (x, y) across the viable area, and test for collision. I will test each possible location. I'll need a grid for (x, y).
           
           I will check the bounding box with the fixed bounding boxes. This prevents object 5 from overlapping with the existing objects.
           
           For diversity, the best region to start at is the top-right. I'll search around there. To place the new object entirely outside an existing box means its location must exceed a minimum boundary. I can construct a grid to sample locations. The order of search will prioritize the top-right, or x,y positive coordinates.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object 7**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for Object ID 7 on Surface 0, taking into account three fixed obstacles: Object IDs 6, 4, and 5. Surface 0 is a rectangle, and I've analyzed the placement, extents, and AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of each object to understand the available space.
           
           Object 7 has its extents, and I've calculated its half-extents.  I've come up with a strategy:
           
           1.  Iterate through `theta` (rotation) values from 0 to 2*pi.
           2.  Calculate the effective half-extents of the rotated Object 7.
           3.  Determine the available x and y ranges on Surface 0, considering the effective half-extents.
           4.  Generate candidate (x, y) coordinates within these ranges.
           5.  Check each candidate placement for collision with the existing obstacles. If no collision, I've found a stable placement.
           
           I identified the occupied areas by the obstacles and aimed to place Object 7 in the remaining free space. My understanding of the collision logic is that two AABBs collide if their corresponding x and y ranges overlap. I've also noted that the available space is fragmented, but that the code should handle those cases.

           2.  Calculate the effective half-extents of the rotated Object 7.
           3.  Determine the available x and y ranges on Surface 0, considering the effective half-extents.
           4.  Generate candidate (x, y) coordinates within these ranges.
           5.  Check each candidate placement for collision with the existing obstacles. If no collision, I've found a stable placement.
           
           I identified the occupied areas by the obstacles and aimed to place Object 7 in the remaining free space. My understanding of the collision logic is that two AABBs collide if their corresponding x and y ranges overlap. I've also noted that the available space is fragmented, but that the code should handle those cases.
