User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point.

           Okay, so I need to generate 25 diverse positions for a robot base relative to a target point. The robot's got a few constraints: it has to be within a 4-unit radius of the target, and it's boxed in by walls at x=-2.5 and 2.5, and y=-2.5 and 2.5.  There's also this vertical wall-like obstacle right down the middle at x=0. Given the target point of (0.9, -1.6), I know the robot needs to stay on the right side of that wall (x>0), specifically at x > 0.05. I also need to make sure the robot base doesn't collide with the other fixed obstacles, which seem to be a mix of scattered blocks and a few "doorways."
           
           My strategy is as follows. I'm going to start by creating a comprehensive list of potentially valid positions by sampling points at different distances and angles around the target. Then, I will filter those candidate points based on these constraints: global boundaries, distance, and collision with fixed obstacles. I will specifically check for collision, by running an AABB test for each fixed obstacle and the proposed robot base. Then, I'll take the first 25 of these valid candidate positions.
