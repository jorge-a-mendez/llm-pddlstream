User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5. There's a central vertical wall at x=0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered around the environment. I need to find positions within a radius of 2 from the target point {target_point} that are not in collision with these obstacles and have a line of sight to the target. I will aim for positions that are spread out around the target to increase the chances of finding clear views.
