           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object

           ```
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)

           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes three graspable and stackable objects (v8, v12, v14) currently located on object v11. The robot has two arms (v4, v6) and is initially at a base configuration v3 with arms at configurations v5 and v7 respectively. The goal is to move all three objects (v8, v12, v14) onto object v16.
           
           However, the only available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which moves the robot from base configuration v3 to v3 (effectively staying in place). This action does not interact with any of the objects, nor does it allow for any picking or placing actions, which are necessary to achieve the goal of changing the location of objects.
           
           Since there are no pick or place actions available, and no other actions that could manipulate the objects, it is impossible to move v8, v12, and v14 from v11 to v16. Therefore, the goal is unachievable with the given set of allowed action instances.
