           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Infeasibility of Achieving the Goal**
           
           My primary objective is to devise a plan to realize the `new-axiom@0()` goal. After carefully expanding the goal and analyzing the initial state, I've determined it's unachievable given the provided constraints.  Specifically, the conjunction of conditions within `new-axiom@0()` requires predicates like `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.  To satisfy these, I need to utilize actions like `send_image` and `send_analysis`. However, the problem statement explicitly restricts me to the action instances listed: `move` and `drop_rock`. Crucially, these required actions are *not* included in the permitted actions. Therefore, I cannot construct a plan to reach the `new-axiom@0()` state under these circumstances.  The goal is unreachable due to the lack of necessary actions.
