           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.033, 0.382, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.766, 0.642).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.216, -0.021), (0.292, 0.054)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.25, 0.379), (-0.157, 0.472)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.117, -0.436), (-0.037, -0.356)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.067, -0.303), (0.164, -0.206)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.254, 0.017, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.043, 0.999).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.007, 0.341), (0.074, 0.422)).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.204, 0.426, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.977, 0.214).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.077, -0.396, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.65, 0.76).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.116, -0.254, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.874, -0.486).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Action Constraints**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) from surface v11 to surface v20.  This is a classic planning problem, and my immediate strategy is to employ `pick` and `place` actions to achieve the `on(obj, v20)` predicate for each object. The key insight here is that `on(obj, v20)` is an axiom dependent on `supported(obj, p, v20)` and `atpose(obj, p)`.  Therefore, for each object, I need to identify a pose 'p' where it's supported on v20 and then execute a pick-and-place operation.
           
           I've carefully examined the initial state facts for each object. Each has `atpose(obj, ...)` indicating their current location on v11, `supported(obj, ..., v11)` which aligns with that location, and `supported(obj, ..., v20)` which supports the goal. They are also all `graspable` and `stackable` and possess a defined pose `#o2` for placement on v20.  Crucially, all objects share the same potential final pose `#o2`. This doesn't pose a problem in itself, but it does mean I need to ensure that the continuous parameter for `#o2` is handled differently for each object if I actually use it.  The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, which are both initially handempty.
           
           Now, the critical constraint: I'm restricted to using *only* the action instances explicitly provided.  The problem statement is clear: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." And the only instance I've been given is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This is a `move_base` action, and it appears to simply refresh `canmove()`, though that's not needed since `pick` and `place` set it to true.
           
           The implications are clear and, frankly, frustrating.  Without `pick` and `place`, I have *no* way to move any object. The `move_base` action, as it stands, is useless for achieving the goal of moving the objects. Neither can the `clean` nor the `cook` action move objects.  The given constraint renders the goal **unreachable**.  I've double-checked the action constraint statement for good measure, and my conclusion stands.  The provided action instances are insufficient to solve the task. I can't construct a valid plan.
