           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.033, 0.382, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.766, 0.642).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.216, -0.021), (0.292, 0.054)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.25, 0.379), (-0.157, 0.472)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.117, -0.436), (-0.037, -0.356)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.067, -0.303), (0.164, -0.206)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.254, 0.017, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.043, 0.999).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.007, 0.341), (0.074, 0.422)).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.204, 0.426, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.977, 0.214).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.077, -0.396, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.65, 0.76).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.116, -0.254, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.874, -0.486).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Here's my plan:**
           
           My primary objective is to move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) from their current positions on object v11 to a new location on object v20. I'll be using the robot's arm (v4) to do this, and its base (v3) won't need to move since it's already in the correct configuration. The assumption is that base configuration #o3 is fixed as v3 as per the `kin` predicates.
           
           The solution requires a series of pick and place actions, each involving one object.
           
           I'll proceed by picking each object from its initial pose and placing it on v20 at a specific new pose, making sure the order is as follows: v8, v12, v14, v16, v18.
           
           **Plan:**
           
           1.  **Move v8:**
               *   Pick v8 from its current location, v9, using arm v4.
               *   Place v8 on v20 at a specific pose: (#o2 v8 v20) (0.0 0.0 0.781 0.0).
           
           2.  **Move v12:**
               *   Pick v12 from its current location, v13, using arm v4.
               *   Place v12 on v20 at a specific pose: (#o2 v12 v20) (0.05 0.0 0.781 0.0).
           
           3.  **Move v14:**
               *   Pick v14 from its current location, v15, using arm v4.
               *   Place v14 on v20 at a specific pose: (#o2 v14 v20) (-0.05 0.0 0.781 0.0).
           
           4.  **Move v16:**
               *   Pick v16 from its current location, v17, using arm v4.
               *   Place v16 on v20 at a specific pose: (#o2 v16 v20) (0.0 0.05 0.781 0.0).
           
           5.  **Move v18:**
               *   Pick v18 from its current location, v19, using arm v4.
               *   Place v18 on v20 at a specific pose: (#o2 v18 v20) (0.0 -0.05 0.781 0.0).
           
           This plan will ensure that all five objects are moved to v20 without any base movements and that the robot will not need to move. There are no blocking conditions, and the planned poses are distinct.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v18 v19 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v18 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Impossibility of Goal Achievement**
           
           Okay, so I've carefully considered the constraints of this problem, and it's become clear that the provided goal is unattainable. The user correctly pointed out my initial oversight: my plan relied on `pick` and `place` actions, which are explicitly *not* valid action instances in this scenario.
           
           My understanding is this: the robot can only perform a single action, `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This boils down to moving the robot's base from and to the *same* location. This single action, while seemingly innocuous, has significant implications for reaching the goal. The goal is to place objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, `v18`) *on* surface `v20`.  To achieve this, I need to manipulate the `atpose` predicates for those objects to place them on the table (`v20`). That means I need to `pick` them up and `place` them down.
           
           However, since `pick` and `place` are not in the valid actions list, I'm effectively handcuffed. The `move_base` action doesn't alter the `atpose` of any objects.
           
           I've even gone through the initial state to verify: none of the target states (`on(v8, v20)`, `on(v12, v20)`, etc.) are initially true.  The objects are supported on `v11`, not `v20`.  Even though the objects are already *supported* by `v20`, they are not *atpose* on `v20`.  To satisfy the goal, I need `atpose(?o, v20)`, which means manipulating objects *to* the right location. That manipulation is impossible, given the valid actions.
           
           Furthermore, executing the `move_base` action doesn't get me any closer. It changes `canmove()` to false, which is something that has to be true to be able to use any valid actions. The cost is zero, meaning that I don't incur cost. The important thing here is that the initial `canmove` is true, which is good.  Once `canmove` is false, it stays false.
           
           The core problem is the *lack* of actions that can modify object positions, which makes the stated goal unreachable with the provided action constraints.
