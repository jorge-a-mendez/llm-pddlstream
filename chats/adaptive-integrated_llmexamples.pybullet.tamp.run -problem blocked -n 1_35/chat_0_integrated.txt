User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.567, 0.083), (-4.489, 0.161)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.528, 0.122, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.66, 0.751).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Atom btraj(#o0)

           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains several objects, some of which are stackable and graspable. There are two arms, `v4` and `v6`, two base configurations, `v3` and `v3` (they are identical), and several poses and continuous parameters represented by objects starting with '#'. The goal is `(new-axiom@0)`, which, according to the axioms, expands to `(on ?green v18)` and `(type ?green v17)`. Looking at the initial state, we have `(type v8 v17)` and `(type v12 v17)`, which means that `v8` or `v12` could be `?green`. We also have `(stackable v8 v18)` and `(stackable v12 v18)`, so both `v8` and `v12` can be placed on `v18`. Therefore, the goal simplifies to putting either `v8` or `v12` on `v18`.
           
           Let's choose `v8` as `?green`. Currently, `v8` is at `v9` and supported by `v11`. To achieve `(on v8 v18)`, we need to place `v8` at a pose `p` such that `(supported v8 p v18)` and `(atpose v8 p)`. The initial state gives us a continuous pose `#o2` for `v8` such that `(supported v8 #o2 v18)` is true. So the plan should involve picking `v8` and then placing it at `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           However, the only available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not allow us to pick or place any objects. Since the goal requires placing an object, and there are no pick/place actions available in the provided list, the goal is not achievable.
           
           No plan is possible.
