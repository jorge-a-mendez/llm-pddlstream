           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Plan: Placing Objects on a Surface**
           
           Okay, so the goal is clear: I need to position objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto surface `v18`. Currently, they're sitting on `v11`, and all the necessary `supported` relations are in place, meaning `v18` can indeed *support* these objects. No problem there.
           
           The available tools are the standard: `move_base`, `pick`, and `place`. Two robot arms, `v4` and `v6`, are ready to be used. Both are currently hand-empty and in their home configurations. The key lies in utilizing the available `kin` predicates, which specify how each arm can interact with each object at its current and desired pose using a suitable grasp and configuration.
           
           My plan unfolds as follows: I need to pick up each object and then place it onto `v18`. This is a straightforward application of the pick-and-place paradigm.
           
           Here's the detailed breakdown for a single object, let's say `v8`. Currently, it's at pose `v9`, supported on `v11`. The goal is `on(v8, v18)`. That means I need to get `v8` to pose `#o2` on `v18`. The sequence will be:
           
           1.  **Move the base configuration.** Given the `kin` and `basemotion` facts, all picks and places seem to require the base to be at configuration `#o3`. Therefore, the first step is to move the robot's base from its starting configuration `v3` to configuration `#o3`. This step might not be required if the base is already at the desired pose, but the plan should include it.
           2.  **Pick:** Arm `v4` will pick up `v8` from its current pose `v9`, using a grasp `#o1` while at configuration `#o3` and moving the arm through the trajectory `#o4`.
           3.  **Place:** Then, `v8` will be placed onto the target pose `#o2` (which is supported by `v18`), again using arm `v4`, the same grasp `#o1`, and trajectory `#o4`. The base configuration remains at `#o3`.
           
           This process is then repeated for each of the remaining objects: `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`. Since the actions don't interfere with each other (the arm is hand-empty after each place), the order doesn't particularly matter.
           We can use arm `v4` for this task.
           
           One thing to verify is that all the actions are *safe*. The `kin` facts inherently provide this. The initial state doesn't have any `unsafepose`, `unsafeapproach`, or `unsafeatraj` predicates, which means all actions are considered safe.
           
           Finally, confirm that all the target poses for the objects are in fact supported by `v18` to satisfy the goal. This is already given in the initial state.
           
           In summary, the optimal plan involves a single base move and four pick-and-place sequences, one for each object.
