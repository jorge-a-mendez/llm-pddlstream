User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is essentially a square room defined by obstacles 0-4. Obstacle 5 is a wall dividing the room into two halves along the y-axis, centered at x=0. There are various other smaller obstacles scattered throughout the room.
           I need to find 3 positions within 2 units of the target point. I will try to place the robot in different quadrants relative to the target to provide diversity. I will try to stay away from the walls and known obstacles as much as possible, as these are the most likely places for collisions or occlusions. Since the robot's orientation is set automatically, I only need to consider the (x,y) coordinates.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     The scene is a square room defined by obstacles 0-4, with a central wall obstacle 5 at x=0. There are also smaller obstacles scattered around.
           My previous attempts had some issues. The position (0.9168925769747355, 2.457816172551062) collided with the top wall (obstacle 0). The other two positions had no line of sight, likely due to obstacle 5, the central wall, or some of the smaller obstacles.
           
           The target point is (-0.5804358720779419, 2.021266460418701). This is in the top-left quadrant, close to the top wall. I need to be careful to stay away from the top wall and the central obstacle 5 (x=0).
           
           I will try positions that are closer to the target point and explore the area to the left and below the target, avoiding the x=0 line.
