User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.047, -0.408), (0.028, -0.332)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.058, 0.313), (0.141, 0.396)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.286, 0.439), (-0.197, 0.528)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.129, 0.37, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.944, 0.33).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.162, -0.33), (0.256, -0.235)).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.01, -0.37, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.039, 0.999).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.099, 0.354, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.103, 0.995).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.241, 0.483, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.986, -0.166).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.209, -0.282, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.858, 0.514).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.178, 0.321), (-0.08, 0.419)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v20)
               Atom on(v12, v20)
               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Action Instance Constraint**
           
           My analysis indicates that the goal of placing objects v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18 onto surface v20 is *unreachable* with the given constraints. The core of the problem lies in the severely restricted set of allowed action instances: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  This implies that only base movements that start and end in configuration v3 are permissible.  Crucially, this list *excludes* the `pick` and `place` actions that are *essential* for manipulating the objects' positions.
           
           I began by examining the initial state, noting the positions and poses of the target objects (currently on surface v11) and the robot's configuration (base at v3, arms handempty). My strategy involved planning to pick each object from its initial pose and place it onto a new pose on v20.  However, this requires the use of `pick` and `place` actions, which in turn necessitates the existence of `kin` predicates, specifying the robot's arm trajectories for each pick and place operation.
           
           The problem specifically states that *only* the provided actions are allowed, and any other action instance is *not permitted*. There are no `kin` facts in the initial state or derivable from axioms, and the given action list only includes a `move_base` action. This leaves me unable to instantiate `pick` or `place` actions, without any valid `kin` facts. Without the ability to change the objects' `atpose` facts, I cannot achieve the goal of having the objects on v20.
           
           I scrutinized the problem statement and constraints multiple times to ensure I had not overlooked any subtle hints or implicitly assumed capabilities.  However, the explicit restriction on action instances is absolute.  Therefore, I must conclude that the goal is unattainable under these circumstances.
