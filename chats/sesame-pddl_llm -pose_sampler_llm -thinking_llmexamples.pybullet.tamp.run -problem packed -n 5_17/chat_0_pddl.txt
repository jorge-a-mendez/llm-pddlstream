(Thoughts: **Fulfilling the Request: Generating Stable Placements**
           
           I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, dimensions ≈ 0.09x0.09) on a surface, which is a square AABB defined by (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135). A placement means defining the surface index (0), rotation angle (theta), and center coordinates (x, y) of the object's bounding box. The object is nearly square, so its bounding box dims change very slightly with rotation. A placement is stable and contained if, when rotated, the object's bounding box is entirely within the surface's bounding box.
           
           To determine stable placements, I'll consider how the effective dimensions (`W`, `H`) of the object's rotated bounding box change with angle (`theta`). I'll use the formulas: `W = w * |cos(theta)| + h * |sin(theta)|` and `H = w * |sin(theta)| + h * |cos(theta)|`, where `w` and `h` are the object's original dimensions.
           
           I need to generate a diverse set of placements. I'll utilize a few key angles, including 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3*pi/4, and pi. I need to space out the placements to ensure good coverage. For theta = 0, I create a dense 5x5 grid of center positions, resulting in 25 placements. For all other angles, I use a 3x3 grid for the center positions for each angle for 36 more placements. Then the first 50 positions from this total are returned.
           
           This approach ensures a good spread of rotations and translations within the surface for each rotation, and the resulting placements will guarantee that the AABB stays within the bounds of the provided surface at any of those rotation angles. This should give a robust and diverse set of stable placements.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for a new, square object (ID 6) on a given surface (ID 0), ensuring these placements don't collide with a pre-existing object (ID 5). I have the prior placement of Object 5, which sits in the bottom-left corner of the surface.
           
           To achieve this, I'll generate a diverse set of candidate placements by varying the object's position (x, y) and rotation angle (theta). The key is to avoid overlap with Object 5's bounding box. For a square, I will generate values of theta `(0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi)`.
           
           Given the surface boundaries, I determine the feasible center points for the new object, considering its size and potential rotations. To find the optimal locations, I'll generate the x,y coordinates and apply the filtering logic for each angle:
           For each combination of angle, x and y, I construct the new objects bounding box, and confirm by applying the rules of not touching or intersecting O5 and returning True. Once 50 valid, non-colliding positions are found, the process concludes.

(Thoughts: **Scene Understanding and Placement Strategy for Object 7**
           
           My primary goal is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 7) on Surface 0, which is a 27cm x 27cm square centered at the origin. Two existing obstacles, Object 5 and Object 6, must be avoided. Object 5 is located in the bottom-left corner of the surface and has an AABB of `(-0.135, -0.135, -0.0445, -0.0445)`. Object 6 is just above Object 5, with an AABB of `(-0.135, -0.0413, -0.0525, 0.0413)`. Object 7 itself is also a square and has a size of (0.098401, 0.098401) .
           
           I have to carefully consider the impact of rotating the new square object. Since the object is perfectly square, the AABB extents don't change by rotating by multiples of 90 degrees, but they *do* change by a factor of sqrt(2) by rotations of 45 degrees. I will use rotations of `0, pi/4, pi/2, 3*pi/4, pi` to explore a diversity of rotations.
           
           To determine if an object placement is valid, I'll need to calculate the AABB of the new object given its position (x, y) and its rotation.
           The current strategy is as follows: 
           
           1.  I have defined a method to detect AABB collision ( min\_x1 < max\_x2 && max\_x1 > min\_x2 && min\_y1 < max\_y2 && max\_y1 > min\_y2 ).
           2.  I will iterate through the valid angles (0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi).
           3.  Based on the rotation I determine W and H.
           4.  Then I will generate a regular grid of x and y center coordinates within the surface bounds, keeping in mind the object's dimensions based on current rotation. The grid needs to have high enough resolution and sufficient coverage to reach 50 placements.
           5.  I will check for collision with each candidate position for this range of x/y values with both objects.
           6.  The placement must not have collision with Object 5 or Object 6, and I will store these valid placements.
           
           Because of the arrangement of objects, the bottom-left corner and the region around objects are constrained. The algorithm will have to carefully generate positions. The general approach is to iterate on the x/y positions in the grid for each rotation and check each point.
           
           I found the following: To avoid collision with the existing objects, the x coordinate of Object 7 must be greater than or equal to -0.044569 (obj5 max_x) + half_w or y coordinate of object 7 must be greater or equal to obj6_max_y + half_h, in order to guarantee there is no overlap.
           
           I am setting up a high-density grid for each angle to make sure at least 50 valid placements are found, with a focus on areas that are "free" from obstacles.
