User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.042, -0.373), (0.139, -0.276)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.291, -0.538), (-0.196, -0.442)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.116, -0.436), (-0.02, -0.341)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.287, 0.378), (-0.189, 0.476)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.09, -0.325, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.955, -0.297).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.244, -0.49, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.262, 0.965).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.068, -0.388, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.966, -0.257).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.238, 0.427, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.325, 0.946).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains multiple objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) that need to be placed on a surface (v18). The initial state describes the current poses of these objects, with v8, v14, and v16 already on surface v11, and v12 also on v11. All these objects are graspable. The robot has two arms (v4 and v6), both of which are currently empty. The robot is at base configuration v3.
           
           The goal is to have all four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) on surface v18. The problem provides a dummy surface v18 that has an AABB of ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). I'll need to compute collision-free poses for these objects on this surface.
           
           Since only one `move_base` action is provided, and it's a null move (from v3 to v3), it won't change the robot's base configuration. This implies that the robot must be able to reach all necessary pick and place locations from the initial base configuration v3.
           
           The plan will involve picking up each object from its current location and placing it onto the v18 surface. There are multiple unknown continuous parameters (poses, grasps, kinematics, trajectories), indicated by '#' in the initial state. I will need to select appropriate ones and provide values for any new pose starting with '#'.
           
           Specifically, the initial state defines `pose(v14, #o2)`, `pose(v16, #o2)`, `pose(v8, #o2)`, and `pose(v12, #o2)` such that they are `supported` on v18. This indicates that #o2 is a pose on v18 that I need to define. I will define four distinct poses for each object on v18, all using the common name `#o2` as instructed. These poses will be on v18, ensuring they are collision-free and stable.
           
           I will use arm v4 for all pick and place operations, as the provided `ataconf(v4, v5)` suggests it's in a useful configuration. Arm v6 is also available, but only one arm is needed.
           
           I need to pick each object, one by one, and place it on surface v18.
           The current poses are:
           v8 at v9 (on v11)
           v14 at v15 (on v11)
           v16 at v17 (on v11)
           v12 at v13 (on v11)
           
           The plan will be:
           1. Pick v8 from v9.
           2. Place v8 onto a new pose on v18 (let's call it `p_v8_on_v18` but use `#o2` in the plan).
           3. Pick v12 from v13.
           4. Place v12 onto a new pose on v18 (let's call it `p_v12_on_v18` but use `#o2` in the plan).
           5. Pick v14 from v15.
           6. Place v14 onto a new pose on v18 (let's call it `p_v14_on_v18` but use `#o2` in the plan).
           7. Pick v16 from v17.
           8. Place v16 onto a new pose on v18 (let's call it `p_v16_on_v18` but use `#o2` in the plan).
           
           For each pick and place, I need to generate suitable continuous parameters. For the `kin` and `traj` parameters, since no specific values are given, I will use generic placeholders, assuming they are computed by an external oracle that guarantees executability and collision-freeness for valid pick/place actions. The problem statement says "Any object that starts with a '#' represents a continuous parameter (e.g., a trajectory, or a pose) that has not yet been computed. If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `pose(obj, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `obj`, then you must provide a continuous value for the pose". In my case, `#o2` is the only pose starting with `#` in the initial state and supported on v18. I need to define the coordinates for each of the objects when placed on v18 using `#o2`.
           
           The AABB of v18 is ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). I will define 4 poses within this bounding box to accommodate the 4 objects. A typical object height is about 0.08m, so z-coordinate will be 0.781 (surface height) + 0.08/2 = 0.821 for a general object.
           
           For simplicity, I will use generic names for the grasps and trajectories, as no specific values are given and the problem expects them to be computed. The problem specifies `grasp(v12, #o1)`, `grasp(v14, #o1)`, `grasp(v16, #o1)`, `grasp(v8, #o1)` implying that `#o1` is the grasp for all these objects. I'll use `#o1` for all grasps.
           Similarly, `btraj(#o0)` and `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)` indicates `#o0` is a btraj. No other traj types (atraj) are given. I'll use placeholders for `atraj` to satisfy the action preconditions.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #a0) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #a1) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #a2) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #a3) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #a4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #a5) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #a6) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #a7)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The provided list of valid action instances only contains `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This action represents a robot moving its base from configuration `v3` to `v3` using trajectory `#o0`. This is essentially a null movement of the base.
           
           The goal is to place four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) onto surface v18. To achieve this, the robot needs to perform `pick` and `place` actions. However, these actions are not present in the allowed list of actions.
           
           Since `pick` and `place` actions are necessary to manipulate objects and achieve the goal state, and these actions are not available in the provided list of valid actions, the goal is unachievable with the given constraints.
