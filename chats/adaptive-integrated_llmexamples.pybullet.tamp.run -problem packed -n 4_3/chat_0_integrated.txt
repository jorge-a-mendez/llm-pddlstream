User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           #o1: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.161, 0.131), (0.26, 0.23)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.05, 0.491), (0.127, 0.568)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.032, 0.315), (0.125, 0.408)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.151, 0.364), (-0.056, 0.459)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.21, 0.18, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.343, 0.939).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.089, 0.53, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, -0.054).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.078, 0.362, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.218, 0.976).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.103, 0.412, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.968, 0.25).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains four graspable objects: v8, v12, v14, and v16. These objects are initially located on surface v11 at poses v9, v13, v15, and v17, respectively. The goal is to place all four objects on surface v18.
           
           The only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action moves the robot's base from its current configuration v3 to the same configuration v3. This means the robot is not intended to move its base in this task, or that the cost of moving the base is negligible and all motions are within reach of the robot's arms. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, both of which are initially empty and at arm configurations v5 and v7 respectively.
           
           The problem requires moving four objects from surface v11 to surface v18. Since there are no `pick` or `place` action instances provided, and only a single `move_base` action, the goal is not achievable. The `move_base` action only changes the base configuration and does not interact with objects or change their locations. To move objects, `pick` and `place` actions would be required, but none are available in the provided list of valid action instances. Therefore, the goal cannot be achieved.
