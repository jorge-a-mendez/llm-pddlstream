           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachability Analysis for new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of the situation.  I'm trying to figure out how to satisfy that new axiom, right? It's all about getting images, analyzing rocks, and making sure everyone's in the right place.
           
           First, I looked at the components of the axiom. It's got those *atconf* predicates, telling me where the rovers are.  It's also got *free* for the stores, *receivedimage* for the images, and *receivedanalysis* for the analysis. Simple enough, in theory.  I can see that the first four subgoals involving rovers and stores are immediately satisfied in the initial state.
           
           Then, I focused on those *receivedimage* subgoals.  To get an image *received*, I need to *send_image*. To *send_image*, I've got to *take_image* and calibrate.  I've got the necessary *imagevisible* and *comvisible* facts.  I've got cameras and the right modes, and no rays are blocked.  So far, so good, right?
           
           The issue comes down to preconditions for *take_image*, *calibrate*, and *send_image*: they all require *atconf* – the rover has to be at a specific configuration.  Specifically, for imaging, I need to be at `#o3`; for communication, I need to be at `#o0`; for soil analysis, I need to be at `#o5`. But here's the kicker: the *initial state* says my rovers, `v12` and `v14`, are at configurations `v13` and `v15` *respectively*.
           
           I've gone over the available actions, the *move* actions, and the initial state. There's no way to move to the configurations needed for taking images, sending them, or taking samples because those configurations are distinct from the starting configurations and the available move actions are basically no-ops, not changing the configuration.  I can't shift my position. The preconditions for image visible, image calibration, communications are simply not satisfiable.
           
           Given this, the goals about receiving images are now impossible, the goals about sampling are impossible because the configuration requirements cannot be met. The new axiom also requires receiving images and soil analysis.  Since both those are now impossible from the starting configuration, I'm forced to conclude: the overall goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable from the initial state given the allowed actions.
