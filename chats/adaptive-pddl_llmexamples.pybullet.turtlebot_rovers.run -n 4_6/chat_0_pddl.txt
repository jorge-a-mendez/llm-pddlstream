           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, and a lander `v9`. Both rovers are equipped with a camera `v10` and are capable of taking images in `v11` mode. There's a storage `v16` that both rovers can use. Several rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`) are present, categorized by `v2` (stone) and `v6` (soil) types. Multiple objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`) are also defined.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` represents a complex state that requires several sub-goals to be met:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: Both rovers are at their initial configurations, which is true in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: Both rovers must have a free storage, which is true in the initial state.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedimage(v20, v11)`: Images of all four objectives must be taken by a rover and sent to the lander.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: At least one rock of type `v2` must be sampled and its analysis sent. `v1`, `v3`, `v4` are of type `v2`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: At least one rock of type `v6` must be sampled and its analysis sent. `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are of type `v6`.
           
           The given valid action instances are only for `move` and `drop_rock`. This means that actions like `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` are not available in this specific problem instance. Without these actions, the subgoals related to taking/sending images and sampling/sending analysis cannot be achieved. Therefore, the overall goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable.
           
           The only available actions are `move` and `drop_rock`. The goal requires `receivedimage` for four objectives and `receivedanalysis` for a rock of type `v2` and a rock of type `v6`. None of these can be achieved with the given actions.
           --Plan--:
           (move v12 v13 #o2 v13)

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Fact is not satisfied: Atom new-axiom@0()`. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The previous plan was invalid because it did not achieve the stated goal. The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires several conditions related to `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`, which are not directly achievable by the `move` or `drop_rock` actions that were listed as the only valid actions. Given that the `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions are explicitly *not* in the list of valid action instances, it is impossible to satisfy the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates in the goal. Therefore, the overall goal is currently unreachable with the provided set of allowed actions.
