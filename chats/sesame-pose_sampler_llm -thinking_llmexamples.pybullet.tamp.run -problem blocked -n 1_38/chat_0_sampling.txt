           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Initial Placement Strategy for Object ID 5**
           
           Okay, I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, dimensions 0.07 x 0.07) on a single surface (surface index 0, defined by points (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0)).  A stable placement requires the object to be entirely within the surface bounds and not colliding with any existing obstacles or other placed objects.  I'll need to generate 50 tuples, each containing (surface index, rotation, x-coordinate, y-coordinate).  Since I'm dealing with a square object on a rectangular surface, and there are no existing obstacles, my initial strategy will be to create a grid of evenly spaced positions.
           
           First, I calculate the valid range for the object's center point. The object's half-extents are 0.035, so the x-coordinate of the center must be between 4.235 and 4.765, and the y-coordinate must be between -0.565 and -0.035.  Given the surface's dimensions (0.6 x 0.6), I'll try an even spacing of 0.05 between placements, as using `0.07` might result in placements right next to each other.
           
           I can make a list of valid x-coordinates: [4.235, 4.285, 4.335, 4.385, 4.435, 4.485, 4.535, 4.585, 4.635, 4.685, 4.735] and a similar list for the y-coordinates: [-0.565, -0.515, -0.465, -0.415, -0.365, -0.315, -0.265, -0.215, -0.165, -0.115, -0.065].  This gives me a total of 11 x 11 = 121 possible placements. I'll take the first 50. Since the object is square, there is no need to vary the `theta`, I'll use 0.
           
           My placements will be:
           
           (0, 0, 4.235, -0.565)
           (0, 0, 4.235, -0.515)
           (0, 0, 4.235, -0.465)
           ...
           (0, 0, 4.235, -0.065)
           
           (0, 0, 4.285, -0.565)
           (0, 0, 4.285, -0.515)
           ...
           (0, 0, 4.285, -0.065)
           
           (0, 0, 4.335, -0.565)
           (0, 0, 4.335, -0.515)
           ...
           (0, 0, 4.335, -0.065)
           
           (0, 0, 4.385, -0.565)
           (0, 0, 4.385, -0.515)
           ...
           (0, 0, 4.385, -0.065)
           
           (0, 0, 4.435, -0.565)
           (0, 0, 4.435, -0.515)
           (0, 0, 4.435, -0.465)
           (0, 0, 4.435, -0.415)
           (0, 0, 4.435, -0.365)
           (0, 0, 4.435, -0.315)
           
           ...and so on.
           If this initial set doesn't work due to unseen constraints, I'll revise.
