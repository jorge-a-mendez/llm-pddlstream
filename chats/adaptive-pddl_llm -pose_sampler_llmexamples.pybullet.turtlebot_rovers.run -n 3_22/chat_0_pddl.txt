           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers (v12 and v14), a lander (v9), a camera (v10), a store (v16), and several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and objectives (v17, v18, v19). The rocks are classified by type (v2 for v1, v3, v4 and v6 for v5, v7, v8). The camera v10 supports mode v11 and is onboard both rovers. Both rovers are currently at their initial configurations (v13 for v12 and v15 for v14) and have free storage (v16). Both rovers can move to their current configuration (effectively staying in place). There are also visibility facts for imaging and communication.
           
           The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`
           3. `free(v12, v16)`
           4. `free(v14, v16)`
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           7. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           8. `type(?stone, v2)` (meaning some rock of type v2 has its analysis received)
           9. `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (same as above)
           10. `type(?soil, v6)` (meaning some rock of type v6 has its analysis received)
           11. `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (same as above)
           
           Let's break down how to achieve each part of the goal:
           
           Parts 1-4: `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)` are all true in the initial state. The available actions `move` and `drop_rock` do not negate these facts when applied with the given parameters. The `move` actions are no-op movements that keep the rovers at their current configurations. `drop_rock` is not possible since the `full` predicate is not met for any store. So these parts of the goal are already satisfied and will remain so.
           
           Parts 5-7: `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`. To achieve this, a rover needs to `take_image` of objectives v17, v18, v19 using camera v10 in mode v11, and then `send_image` of them.
           For `take_image`, the rover must be `atconf`, the camera `onboard`, `supports` the mode, `calibrated`, and `imagevisible` to the objective without `blocked` ray.
           For `send_image`, the rover must be `atconf`, `comvisible` to the lander, `haveimage` of the objective, and `objective` and `mode` predicates must hold, and the ray not `blocked`.
           There are no `calibrate` or `take_image` or `send_image` actions in the allowed action instances list. Thus, these parts of the goal are unachievable.
           
           Parts 8-11: `type(?stone, v2)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, `type(?soil, v6)`, `receivedanalysis(?soil)`. This requires `receivedanalysis` for at least one rock of type v2 and at least one rock of type v6.
           To achieve this, a rover needs to `sample_rock` and then `send_analysis`.
           For `sample_rock`, the rover must be `above` the rock, `atconf`, `store` available, and `free` store. This action makes the store `full` and the rock `analyzed`.
           For `send_analysis`, the rover must be `atconf`, `comvisible` to the lander, `analyzed` the rock, `rock` predicate must hold, and the ray not `blocked`.
           There are no `sample_rock` or `send_analysis` actions in the allowed action instances list. Thus, these parts of the goal are also unachievable.
           
           Since none of the actions required to achieve the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` components of the goal are available, the goal is unachievable.
           The only allowed actions are `move` and `drop_rock`. Neither of these actions can directly or indirectly lead to the achievement of `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           
           The goal is not achievable given the allowed actions.
