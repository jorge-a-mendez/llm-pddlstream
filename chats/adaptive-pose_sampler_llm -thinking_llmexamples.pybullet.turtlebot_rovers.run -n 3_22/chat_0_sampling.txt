User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Here's the breakdown of my thinking to find suitable robot base positions:**
           
           First, I needed to understand the environment – specifically the fixed obstacles – and identify potential problems. I realized that the central vertical obstacle (AABB 5) was a major concern, as it could easily block line-of-sight to the target, especially if I positioned the robot base on the 'wrong' side. The target point is at `(1.5273, -0.6277)`, which places it in the bottom-right quadrant and to the right of this central obstacle.  Therefore, I concluded it's generally best for the robot to be on the right side of x = 0.
           
           To find valid positions, I focused on three main constraints: distance from the target (within 2 units), staying within the environment bounds (x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5]), and avoiding collisions with fixed obstacles. I visualized the obstacles, particularly the central wall, and considered its impact on line-of-sight.
           
           I then formed a strategy to pick good starting points, centered around the target:
           
           1.  I started by defining a circle of radius 2 centered at the target, ensuring all positions are within that circle.
           2.  I filtered points inside that circle by the environment boundaries.
           3.  I decided to pick points at various angles around the target and then adjust. This meant checking for collisions and for line-of-sight obstructions for each proposed point.
           
           Given the target's location, my first instinct was to explore the space around it, keeping in mind the need to avoid the central obstacle.
           
           I arrived at these positions as the most plausible, given my observations and analyses:
           
           1.  **Candidate 1: `(0.06, -0.6277)`**:  Just to the right of the central obstacle (x=0) and directly 'behind' the target from the perspective of the task.
           2.  **Candidate 2: `(2.4, -0.6277)`**: A position directly to the right of the target.
           3.  **Candidate 3: `(1.5273, 0.8723)`**: Directly "above" the target.
           
           I carefully checked the distance from the target for all candidates, as well as line-of-sight (LOS) blockages for the known obstacles for each of these three points. The key for each step was to avoid, primarily, the central wall. I determined that all three points met the criteria: They were within the specified range, within environment limits, and had a clear line of sight to the target.
           
           These candidate positions are spread out, within the appropriate range of the target, and meet all the constraints – providing a diversity of locations to the end-user.
