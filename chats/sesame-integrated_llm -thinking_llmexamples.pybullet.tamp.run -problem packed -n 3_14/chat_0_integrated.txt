           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.245, 0.238), (-0.15, 0.334)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.25, -0.558), (-0.153, -0.461)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.128, 0.181), (0.221, 0.274)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.198, 0.286, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.864, 0.504).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.202, -0.51, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.28, 0.96).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.174, 0.228, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.539, 0.843).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning to Stack Objects**
           
           My objective is clear: I need to place objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto surface `v16`. Currently, these objects are situated on surface `v11`.  The task hinges on executing a series of "pick" and "place" actions using arm `v4`.  I need to ensure the robot moves to a suitable base configuration (`#o3`), picks each object (using grasp `#o1`) from its initial location, and then places it on `v16` at a specific pose designated as `#o2`. The main challenge lies in arranging these three objects on `v16` without any collisions, as the surface is relatively small.
           
           The solution requires careful calculation and assignment of the continuous pose values for the symbolic pose `#o2` used in the initial state of the problem for each of the objects. Since multiple objects will be placed on `v16`, I must assign unique pose values for each one. From the provided information, I can see that all objects will be placed at a similar height to their initial positions (z=0.781). I will place them in a line using unique `x` and `y` values to avoid collisions, keeping them centered near the (0,0) location.
           
           My plan proceeds as follows: First, I will have the robot move to base configuration `#o3` (using move_base). Then, I will pick up each object and place it on `v16` at one of the three unique poses. I will compute and provide continuous values for each pose that ensures that the robot can avoid the collisions that can occur while placing three objects on the given area `v16`. Since kinematic checks exist, these values should work well, given that no static obstacle is present.
           
           To summarize, my plan involves a `move_base` action followed by three sets of `pick` and `place` actions: one for each of the objects. I must provide precise continuous values for the unique pose `#o2` associated with each object placement on `v16` to ensure collision-free motion and to satisfy the goal state.
