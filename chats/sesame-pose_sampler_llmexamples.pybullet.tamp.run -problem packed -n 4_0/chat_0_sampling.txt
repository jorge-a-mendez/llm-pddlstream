           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 4) -- 0.08266041677719466, 0.0826604167771946)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single square surface centered at the origin. The object is also square, with sides of approximately 0.0827. Since the object is smaller than the surface, there are many possible stable placements. I will try to place the object centrally and then explore various rotations and translations within the bounds of the surface.
           
           The surface 0 has extents from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           The object has a side length of 0.08266.
           
           For the object to be fully contained, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           x - size_x/2 >= -0.135 => x >= -0.135 + 0.08266/2 = -0.135 + 0.04133 = -0.09367
           x + size_x/2 <= 0.135 => x <= 0.135 - 0.04133 = 0.09367
           
           Similarly for y:
           y - size_y/2 >= -0.135 => y >= -0.09367
           y + size_y/2 <= 0.135 => y <= 0.09367
           
           So, for any rotation, the center of the object must be within the square defined by (-0.09367, -0.09367) and (0.09367, 0.09367).
           
           For a square object, the bounding box size remains the same regardless of rotation due to how `size_x` and `size_y` are defined. However, generally, for a rotated rectangle, the effective bounding box changes. Since the provided `size_x` and `size_y` are the extents of the *object's AABB*, they are constant regardless of its orientation. Therefore, the valid center ranges derived above are valid for any rotation.
           
           I will generate a variety of placements, varying position and rotation within these constraints.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene is the same as before, with a single square surface centered at the origin: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           The new object, ID 5, is also square, with sides of approximately 0.0910.
           
           I need to place object ID 5 on surface 0, ensuring it's stable and within bounds.
           The previous placement for object ID 4 was `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. I must ensure that the new placement for object ID 5 does not collide with object ID 4. Since both objects are square and the previous placement of object 4 was at (0,0,0,0), any placement of object 5 that would overlap with object 4 should be avoided if object 4 is considered to be a fixed obstacle. However, the prompt says "If you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j." This means I need to account for the object 4.
           
           Object 4 AABB:
           min_x = 0.0 - 0.08266041677719466 / 2 = -0.04133
           max_x = 0.0 + 0.08266041677719466 / 2 = 0.04133
           min_y = 0.0 - 0.0826604167771946 / 2 = -0.04133
           max_y = 0.0 + 0.0826604167771946 / 2 = 0.04133
           
           So, object 4 occupies the region `(-0.04133, -0.04133)` to `(0.04133, 0.04133)`.
           
           Now for object 5 (size_x, size_y: 0.09098, 0.09098):
           Its half-size is 0.09098 / 2 = 0.04549.
           For object 5 to be fully contained on surface 0:
           x_min_surf = -0.135
           x_max_surf = 0.135
           y_min_surf = -0.135
           y_max_surf = 0.135
           
           The center (x, y) for object 5 must satisfy:
           x - 0.04549 >= -0.135 => x >= -0.08951
           x + 0.04549 <= 0.135 => x <= 0.08951
           y - 0.04549 >= -0.135 => y >= -0.08951
           y + 0.04549 <= 0.135 => y <= 0.08951
           
           So object 5's center must be within `(-0.08951, -0.08951)` to `(0.08951, 0.08951)`.
           
           Collision avoidance with object 4:
           Object 4 is centered at (0,0) with half-extents of 0.04133.
           Object 5, if placed, must not overlap with `(-0.04133, -0.04133)` to `(0.04133, 0.04133)`.
           
           This means that for object 5 to not collide with object 4, the minimum distance from object 5's center (cx5, cy5) to the origin (0,0) must be such that:
           abs(cx5) > 0.04133 + 0.04549 = 0.08682
           OR
           abs(cy5) > 0.04133 + 0.04549 = 0.08682
           
           So, the central region of the surface is occupied by object 4. I need to place object 5 in one of the corners or along the edges of the available space, outside of object 4's bounding box.
           The maximum allowed center coordinate for object 5 is 0.08951.
           The minimum allowed center coordinate to avoid object 4 is 0.08682 (for positive x/y).
           This leaves a very narrow band of space around object 4. For instance, (0.087, 0.0) or (0.0, 0.087). Or at the very corners, e.g., (0.087, 0.087).
           
           I'll try to place object 5 at the edges of the available space, ensuring it doesn't collide with object 4 and remains within surface 0.

           *   Size: `0.09054`. Half-size: `0.04527`.
           
           **Surface Constraints for Object 7:**
           For object 7 to be fully contained on surface 0:
           x_center - 0.04527 >= -0.135 => x_center >= -0.08973
           x_center + 0.04527 <= 0.135 => x_center <= 0.08973
           y_center - 0.04527 >= -0.135 => y_center >= -0.08973
           y_center + 0.04527 <= 0.135 => y_center <= 0.08973
           So, object 7's center must be within `(-0.08973, -0.08973)` to `(0.08973, 0.08973)`.
           
           **Collision Avoidance for Object 7:**
           Object 7 must not overlap with Object 4's AABB `(-0.04133, -0.04133)` to `(0.04133, 0.04133)`.
           Object 7 must not overlap with Object 5's AABB `(0.04151, -0.04549)` to `(0.13249, 0.04549)`.
           
           Let's visualize the occupied space:
           Object 4 occupies the central square.
           Object 5 occupies a rectangle to the right of Object 4, extending almost to the surface edge on the right.
           
           The remaining available space is primarily to the left, top, and bottom of Object 4, and possibly small regions in the corners that are not encroached upon by Object 5's vertical extent.
           
           Let's calculate the minimum distance for object 7 to avoid object 4:
           To avoid object 4 along X: abs(x_center_7) > 0.04133 (half_size_4) + 0.04527 (half_size_7) = 0.0866
           To avoid object 4 along Y: abs(y_center_7) > 0.04133 (half_size_4) + 0.04527 (half_size_7) = 0.0866
           
           So, for object 7 to not collide with object 4, the center (cx7, cy7) must satisfy:
           abs(cx7) > 0.0866 OR abs(cy7) > 0.0866.
           
           Now, considering Object 5.
           Object 5 occupies `x` from `0.04151` to `0.13249`.
           Object 7, if its center is `(cx7, cy7)`, occupies `x` from `cx7 - 0.04527` to `cx7 + 0.04527`.
           To avoid Object 5, Object 7's AABB cannot overlap with Object 5's AABB.
           This means:
           1. `cx7 + 0.04527 < 0.04151` (Object 7 is entirely to the left of Object 5) => `cx7 < 0.04151 - 0.04527 = -0.00376`
           OR
           2. `cx7 - 0.04527 > 0.13249` (Object 7 is entirely to the right of Object 5) => `cx7 > 0.13249 + 0.04527 = 0.17776` (This is outside surface bounds 0.08973)
           
           Also, along Y, Object 5 occupies `y` from `-0.04549` to `0.04549`.
           To avoid Object 5 along Y:
           `cy7 + 0.04527 < -0.04549` (Object 7 is entirely below Object 5) => `cy7 < -0.04549 - 0.04527 = -0.09076`
           OR
           `cy7 - 0.04527 > 0.04549` (Object 7 is entirely above Object 5) => `cy7 > 0.04549 + 0.04527 = 0.09076` (This is outside surface bounds 0.08973)
           
           Let's combine these:
           *   `cx7` must be in `[-0.08973, 0.08973]`.
           *   `cy7` must be in `[-0.08973, 0.08973]`.
           
           Collision with Object 4:
           `abs(cx7) <= 0.0866` AND `abs(cy7) <= 0.0866` implies collision with object 4. So we need to ensure this is NOT true.
           
           Collision with Object 5:
           Object 5 spans X from 0.04151 to 0.13249.
           Object 5 spans Y from -0.04549 to 0.04549.
           
           If `cx7 > -0.00376`, then to avoid object 5, object 7 must be outside the Y range of object 5.
           This means `cy7 < -0.09076` or `cy7 > 0.09076`, which is not possible within the surface bounds for cy7 `[-0.08973, 0.08973]`.
           This implies that `cx7` must be less than `-0.00376`.
           So, `cx7` must be in `[-0.08973, -0.00376]`.
           
           Now, we need to satisfy `abs(cx7) > 0.0866` OR `abs(cy7) > 0.0866` (to avoid obj 4), AND `cx7` must be in `[-0.08973, -0.00376]` to avoid obj 5.
           Given `cx7` must be negative, the condition `abs(cx7) > 0.0866` simplifies to `cx7 < -0.0866`.
           So, to avoid both objects, we need `cx7` in `[-0.08973, -0.0866]`.
           Within this range, `cx7` is approximately `-0.087` to `-0.089`.
           If `cx7` is in this range, then `abs(cx7) > 0.0866` is satisfied, and so we avoid object 4 along X.
           Also, the range for `cx7` (`[-0.08973, -0.0866]`) satisfies `cx7 < -0.00376`, thus avoiding object 5.
           
           So, valid placements exist where `cx7` is around `-0.087` to `-0.089`.
           For such `cx7`, the `cy7` can be anywhere within its valid range `[-0.08973, 0.08973]`.
           Example: `(-0.087, 0.0)` or `(-0.087, 0.087)`.

           *   Size: `0.09826`. Half-size: `0.04913`.
           
           **Surface Constraints for Object 6:**
           For object 6 to be fully contained on surface 0:
           x_center - 0.04913 >= -0.135 => x_center >= -0.08587
           x_center + 0.04913 <= 0.135 => x_center <= 0.08587
           y_center - 0.04913 >= -0.135 => y_center >= -0.08587
           y_center + 0.04913 <= 0.135 => y_center <= 0.08587
           So, object 6's center must be within `(-0.08587, -0.08587)` to `(0.08587, 0.08587)`.
           
           **Collision Avoidance for Object 6:**
           Object 6 must not overlap with:
           *   Object 4's AABB `(-0.04133, -0.04133)` to `(0.04133, 0.04133)`.
           *   Object 5's AABB `(0.04151, -0.04549)` to `(0.13249, 0.04549)`.
           *   Object 7's AABB `(-0.13227, -0.04527)` to `(-0.04173, 0.04527)`.
           
           Let's analyze the occupied space along X and Y axes.
           **X-axis occupied regions for half-extents of the new object (0.04913):**
           *   Object 4: `[-0.04133, 0.04133]`
           *   Object 5: `[0.04151, 0.13249]`
           *   Object 7: `[-0.13227, -0.04173]`
           
           Combining these, the X-axis is heavily occupied in the central and side regions.
           `[-0.13227, -0.04173]` (Obj 7)
           `[-0.04133, 0.04133]` (Obj 4)
           `[0.04151, 0.13249]` (Obj 5)
           
           The Y-axis for these objects is roughly `[-0.045, 0.045]`. This means the central horizontal strip is occupied.
           
           For Object 6 (half-size 0.04913):
           To avoid Object 4 along X: abs(cx6) > 0.04133 + 0.04913 = 0.09046. (This is outside surface bounds 0.08587)
           This means if Object 6 is to avoid Object 4 along X, its center would need to be outside `[-0.09046, 0.09046]`. However, its own center must be within `[-0.08587, 0.08587]`. This implies that `cx6` cannot avoid `obj4` by X-translation, *if* `cy6` is within the Y-range of `obj4`.
           So, object 6's center cannot be such that it entirely clears object 4 *only* in X if its Y-center overlaps. It must clear it along Y.
           
           Let's look at the available Y-range for object 6, considering the existing objects.
           The combined Y-range of existing objects (4, 5, 7) is approximately `[-0.04549, 0.04549]`.
           For object 6 (half-size `0.04913`) to avoid this strip along Y:
           cy6 - 0.04913 > 0.04549 => cy6 > 0.04549 + 0.04913 = 0.09462 (This is outside surface bounds 0.08587)
           OR
           cy6 + 0.04913 < -0.04549 => cy6 < -0.04549 - 0.04913 = -0.09462 (This is outside surface bounds 0.08587)
           
           This is a critical observation! If the new object is this large, it seems it cannot entirely avoid the central horizontal strip *even along Y*. This means it must somehow fit in the X-gaps *between* objects 4, 5, and 7, which are almost non-existent.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the collision logic more carefully.
           Let AABB_obj4 = `(-0.04133, -0.04133)` to `(0.04133, 0.04133)`
           Let AABB_obj5 = `(0.04151, -0.04549)` to `(0.13249, 0.04549)`
           Let AABB_obj7 = `(-0.13227, -0.04527)` to `(-0.04173, 0.04527)`
           
           A placement (cx, cy) for object 6 (half-size 0.04913) is valid if:
           1. It's within surface bounds: `cx, cy in [-0.08587, 0.08587]`.
           2. It doesn't collide with obj 4.
           3. It doesn't collide with obj 5.
           4. It doesn't collide with obj 7.
           
           No collision between two AABBs (min1, max1) and (min2, max2) happens if `max1 < min2` or `min1 > max2` in at least one dimension.
           
           Let AABB_obj6_x = `(cx - 0.04913, cx + 0.04913)`
           Let AABB_obj6_y = `(cy - 0.04913, cy + 0.04913)`
           
           **Collision with Object 4:**
           No collision if (`cx + 0.04913 < -0.04133` OR `cx - 0.04913 > 0.04133`) OR (`cy + 0.04913 < -0.04133` OR `cy - 0.04913 > 0.04133`).
           Simplified: `cx < -0.09046` OR `cx > 0.09046` OR `cy < -0.09046` OR `cy > 0.09046`.
           Since `cx, cy` must be in `[-0.08587, 0.08587]`, this means `cx` cannot be `<-0.09046` or `>0.09046`.
           Therefore, to avoid Object 4, it *must* be `cy < -0.09046` or `cy > 0.09046`.
           But `cy` must be in `[-0.08587, 0.08587]`.
           This is a contradiction! It appears that object 6, with its current size, cannot be placed without colliding with object 4, given the current AABB interpretation.
           
           This problem suggests that I might have misunderstood the exact definition of "collision" or "stable placement" if the object's dimensions are truly fixed as AABB extents. Or, the available space is simply too small.
           
           Let's re-read: "Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 6) -- 0.09826400141807418, 0.0982640014180742)`." This means the object, *regardless of rotation*, has an AABB of this size. So, the rotated AABB calculation is not needed; I only need to consider its fixed AABB size.
           
           The calculation above seems correct. Let me double check the numbers.
           Object 6 half-size = 0.09826 / 2 = 0.04913.
           Surface bounds for object 6 center: `[-0.135 + 0.04913, 0.135 - 0.04913]` = `[-0.08587, 0.08587]`.
           
           Object 4 AABB x-range: `[-0.04133, 0.04133]`.
           Object 6 AABB x-range for center `cx`: `[cx - 0.04913, cx + 0.04913]`.
           Collision if: `cx - 0.04913 < 0.04133` AND `cx + 0.04913 > -0.04133`.
           Simplified: `cx < 0.04133 + 0.04913 = 0.09046` AND `cx > -0.04133 - 0.04913 = -0.09046`.
           So, collision in X with Object 4 if `cx` is in `(-0.09046, 0.09046)`.
           
           Object 4 AABB y-range: `[-0.04133, 0.04133]`.
           Object 6 AABB y-range for center `cy`: `[cy - 0.04913, cy + 0.04913]`.
           Collision if: `cy < 0.09046` AND `cy > -0.09046`.
           So, collision in Y with Object 4 if `cy` is in `(-0.09046, 0.09046)`.
           
           For object 6 to NOT collide with object 4:
           (`cx >= 0.09046` OR `cx <= -0.09046`) OR (`cy >= 0.09046` OR `cy <= -0.09046`).
           
           However, `cx` and `cy` must be within `[-0.08587, 0.08587]`.
           This means:
           `cx >= 0.09046` is impossible.
           `cx <= -0.09046` is impossible.
           `cy >= 0.09046` is impossible.
           `cy <= -0.09046` is impossible.
           
           This implies that if only object 4 existed, object 6 cannot be placed without colliding with object 4. This is a problem.
           I need to be very careful here. Is it possible that the object ID 6 is actually smaller or that the fixed obstacles (4, 5, 7) are not absolutely fixed in terms of collision detection (i.e., maybe they can be nudged by a new object, which contradicts the prompt "avoid collision between objects i and j")? Or maybe the provided `size_x, size_y` are for a *particular* orientation of the object, and rotation can make it fit? No, "extent" usually refers to the AABB of the object regardless of its orientation.
           
           "Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 6) -- 0.09826400141807418, 0.0982640014180742)`." This means its AABB is *always* 0.09826 x 0.09826.
           
           If the above calculations are correct, then it's impossible to place object 6 without colliding with object 4. This means either:
           1. There's a slight numerical tolerance I'm missing (highly unlikely for exact AABB calculation).
           2. The problem implies "stable placement" can mean "barely touching" rather than strictly "no overlap".
           3. I've misunderstood something fundamental about the geometry or collision.
           4. The problem is truly impossible under the given constraints.
           
           Given the instructions "You never give up", I must try to find a placement.
           The only way for my calculation to be wrong is if the AABB size is not *always* `size_x, size_y`, but perhaps this is the size for a specific rotation (e.g., 0 radians), and other rotations could lead to a *smaller* AABB (which is counterintuitive for "extents"). However, for a square object, `size_x` and `size_y` will be maximum when aligned with axes, and the diagonal length would determine the maximum extent for rotated AABB. But the problem states "x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)". This usually means it's the fixed AABB.
           
           If the object is a square of side `s`, its AABB is always `s x s` regardless of rotation, if `size_x` and `size_y` describe the sides of the square itself. If `size_x` and `size_y` describe the AABB of a general rectangle *at a specific rotation*, then rotation would change the AABB. But here, `size_x` and `size_y` are identical, implying a square object. For a square, the AABB is always the side length, unless we are talking about the bounding box of a *rotated* square on a fixed axis system, in which case the bounding box could be larger (using the diagonal). However, "extents (size_x, size_y)" refers to the AABB dimensions. So, I will proceed assuming the AABB of object 6 is always 0.09826 x 0.09826.
           
           Let's check the absolute limits.
           Surface bounds for object 6 center: `x, y in [-0.08587, 0.08587]`.
           Required for no collision with Object 4: `cx` or `cy` must be outside `(-0.09046, 0.09046)`.
           This is impossible. The ranges `[-0.08587, 0.08587]` and `(-0.09046, 0.09046)` fully overlap such that no center can satisfy the condition.
           
           This scenario is very difficult. I will assume there might be a very, very tiny numerical tolerance where `0.08587` is just outside `0.09046`. This is incorrect mathematically.
           Perhaps I should revisit the concept of stability. "fully contained within the bounds of the surface."
           
           If it's impossible to avoid object 4, it means any placement will cause a collision. Since I must provide 50 placements, and I'm told "You never give up", I will provide placements at the edge of the surface (but still invalid due to collision with obj 4). This may indicate to the system that the object cannot be placed, or that my interpretation of collision detection is too strict.
           
           I will try to place it at the absolute edge of the available space, maybe this tiny margin matters. I will assume that "avoid collision" means the AABBs must not strictly overlap (i.e. overlap region must be zero or negative).
           The required distance to clear object 4 along an axis is 0.09046. The maximum allowed center is 0.08587.
           
           Let's assume there is some epsilon. For example, if x_center = 0.08587, then `x - 0.04913 = 0.03674`, `x + 0.04913 = 0.135`.
           Object 4 AABB is `[-0.04133, 0.04133]`.
           If `cx = 0.08587`, then `0.03674 < 0.04133`. So there is an overlap.
           If `cx = -0.08587`, then `0.04133 > -0.04133`. So there is an overlap.
           
           The only way for this to be possible is if the object's specified `size_x, size_y` are not its *true* AABB (in a fixed global coordinate system) when rotated, but rather the dimensions of its physical body, and the "AABB" of the *rotated* object is what matters for collision, which means the object's AABB will change with rotation. This would make `size_x` and `size_y` the actual width and height of the object itself. However, "x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)" explicitly states these are the AABB dimensions. If the object is a square (which it is, since `size_x == size_y`), its AABB *is* always `size x size` in any orientation, aligned with the axes. This means a square object has a fixed AABB.
           
           This looks like an impossible placement if strictly following AABB collision rules.
           I will generate placements that would otherwise be valid if only surface constraints were considered, but will fail due to object 4's presence. I will prioritize positions that are furthest from objects 4, 5, and 7, hoping some tiny numerical tolerance works or that some of my collision assumptions are off.
           
           The region that is *not* occupied by Object 4, 5, or 7:
           *   Y for existing objects is approx `[-0.045, 0.045]`.
           *   X for existing objects covers `[-0.132, -0.0417]` and `[-0.0413, 0.0413]` and `[0.0415, 0.132]`.
           This means the Y-strip from approx -0.045 to 0.045 is almost fully blocked in X.
           The *only* possible region to place object 6 (half size 0.04913) would be in the Y "channels" above `y=0.045` or below `y=-0.045`.
           Let's re-examine `cy < -0.09462` or `cy > 0.09462` to avoid the entire central horizontal strip.
           This condition is stricter than `cy < -0.09046` or `cy > 0.09046` (to avoid object 4 along Y).
           Both conditions are outside `[-0.08587, 0.08587]`.
           
           The problem statement "You never give up. No matter how many times you fail to provide a placement, or how many valid placements you have already provided, you will always try to find a new placement." suggests I should still try.
           
           I will attempt placing it as close as possible to the corners of the surface, as this would maximize the distance from the existing objects, primarily focusing on the Y-axis extremes. For example, `(0.0, 0.085)` for `cy` (very close to the upper limit). At `cy = 0.085`, `obj6` AABB would be `[0.085 - 0.04913, 0.085 + 0.04913]` which is `[0.03587, 0.13413]`. This would clear the Y-range of obj4.
           If `cy = 0.085`, then `obj6_y` range is `[0.03587, 0.13413]`.
           This would clear the Y-range of obj4 (0.04133). And it clears obj5 and obj7 y-ranges (0.04549 and 0.04527 respectively).
           
           So, the condition for `cy` to avoid object 4 (and by extension objects 5 & 7, which have smaller Y-extents) is `cy + 0.04913 < -0.04133` or `cy - 0.04913 > 0.04133`.
           This simplifies to `cy < -0.09046` or `cy > 0.09046`.
           Still, these are outside `[-0.08587, 0.08587]`.
           
           The only possible logical conclusion is that the `size_x` and `size_y` given are the dimensions *when aligned*, and rotation can make the effective AABB smaller, or there's some special geometry of squares. But for a square, the AABB is always `side x side` if axis-aligned, or `diagonal x diagonal` if rotated 45 degrees. The prompt usually provides the largest dimension of the AABB for *any* rotation. Given this constraint, it is impossible.
           
           I will provide placements at the extreme edges of the surface for the new object. These will likely collide with the existing objects given my calculations, but I'm instructed not to give up. The most "stable" locations would be the corners.
