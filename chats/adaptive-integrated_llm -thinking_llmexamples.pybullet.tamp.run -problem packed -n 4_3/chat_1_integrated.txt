User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object

           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.206, 0.228, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.004, 1.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.218, -0.431, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.52, 0.854).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.04, 0.399, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.857, 0.515).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.073, -0.336), (0.002, -0.261)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.17, 0.192), (0.241, 0.263)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.265, -0.478), (-0.171, -0.384)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.036, -0.298, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, -0.04).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.088, 0.351), (0.007, 0.446)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **The Challenge: Orchestrating a Precise Object Transfer**
           
           I'm tasked with devising a plan to move four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) from their current perch on v11 onto the target surface v18.  The key is to use the robot arm, v4, to execute a series of "pick" and "place" actions. Since the robot's base can't move, the planning will be simplified. The only move that will be allowed in this problem is `move_base v3 v3`.  It will be skipped from the plan as the base is already at the correct position.
           
           To get the four objects, each supported on v11, to v18 will follow four actions, that involve picking an object and then placing them on their desired destination surface. Specifically, I'll need to use the `pick` and `place` action instances to manipulate the objects.
           
           The `pick` preconditions are all given. I need to make sure the robot arm v4 is empty, it can reach the object on its current surface, and it is safe to pick. The `place` preconditions are all given as well, the robot arm needs to have the object, that can reach the target surface (v18), and be safe.
           
           Based on the scenario, I need to create a plan that addresses each object sequentially. The sequence will be "pick" an object and "place" it on v18. Given all the kinematic relationships provided in the initial state, I can construct the individual steps. The plan will contain a list of 'pick' and 'place' actions:
           
           1.  **Pick v8 from v9 and Place it on v18**:  This requires a concrete pose on v18, which is uniquely linked with the placeholder `#o2` symbol.
           2.  **Pick v12 from v13 and Place it on v18**: A similar move but the key here is to choose a unique target pose on v18.
           3.  **Pick v14 from v15 and Place it on v18**: Place it at its unique position given by `#o2`.
           4.  **Pick v16 from v17 and Place it on v18**: Place it at its unique position given by `#o2`.
           
           **Specific Considerations**
           
           Given the instruction and the fact that the problem specifies `supported(object, #o2, surface)`, means for each object I will need to select a unique continuous coordinate on v18. I need to carefully calculate the poses of placement on the target surface, taking collision-avoidance into account. v18 is smaller than v11 and I need to select a set of positions that allows for the four objects to be placed. The dimensions of the objects will be taken into account for the layout.
           
           **The Strategy for Surface Placement**
           Since the problem states that I need a different `pose` for all four objects, I must assign distinct poses for each object on v18, I've decided to subdivide the v18 area into four quadrants to minimize the chances of collisions. By spreading each object to the four quadrants, the objects will be placed such that they occupy a position at the center and four corners of v18.
           
           Here's the planned approach:
           1. v8: (0.07, 0.07, 0.781) on v18.
           2. v12: (-0.07, 0.07, 0.781) on v18.
           3. v14: (-0.07, -0.07, 0.781) on v18.
           4. v16: (0.07, -0.07, 0.781) on v18.
           
           **Cost Evaluation**
           
           The costs for pick and place are all the same, so I don't need to consider any optimization in the sequence. I can order them alphabetically to avoid any future confusion. The robot cannot move the base, since the action allowed `move_base v3 v3` and the robot base is already at `v3` which is the one that's needed for the plan and does not affect the plan.
           
           I am confident that the proposed plan, with its precise handling of continuous parameters and strategic placement, will successfully move the objects and meet all the preconditions.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user's pointed out a significant issue with the initial plan.  They noticed that the plan relies on `pick` and `place` actions, which aren't explicitly listed as valid action instances. The *only* allowed action is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  This is a huge problem.
           
           The goal we're working towards is `on(v8, v18) & on(v12, v18) & on(v14, v18) & on(v16, v18)`.  We need to get these objects onto `v18`. Looking at the initial state, it's clear they're currently supported on `v11`.  Therefore, we *need* to pick each object up (using a `pick` action) and then place them (using a `place` action) on `v18`. 
           
           But, we can't do that. The given valid action instance only allows for robot motion, not object manipulation.  Since we *must* use only allowed action instances, this goal is *impossible* to achieve with the given constraints. I'm afraid I have to conclude that this plan is infeasible because the necessary actions for achieving the goal are not available.
