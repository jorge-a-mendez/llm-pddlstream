User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with inner dimensions 5x5, centered at (0,0). There's a vertical wall in the middle along x=0. There are also several smaller rectangular obstacles within the room. I will try to find positions for the robot base that are within 2 units of the target point, avoiding the known obstacles and the walls. I will prioritize positions that are likely to have line-of-sight to the target.
