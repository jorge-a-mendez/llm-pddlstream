           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27. The object is also square, with side length approximately 0.0786. This means the object is significantly smaller than the surface, allowing for many possible placements.
           
           To find stable placements, I will consider placing the object on surface 0. Since the object is square, its orientation (theta) does not affect its bounding box, so I can keep theta at 0 for simplicity, or vary it if it adds to diversity without introducing instability. The object needs to be fully contained within the surface. The surface extends from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. The object has a half-extent of 0.07856657716148471 / 2 = 0.03928328858074235.
           
           Therefore, for the object to be contained, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.03928328858074235 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.03928328858074235
           -0.09571671141925765 <= x <= 0.09571671141925765
           
           And similarly for y. I will generate a diverse set of (x, y) coordinates within this valid range, and vary theta for some of the placements.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have learned that placing object 4 at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) is stable.
           Now I need to place object 7, which has dimensions (0.09017, 0.09017). This object is also square.
           The surface 0 remains the same: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           The new object (ID: 7) has a half-extent of 0.09017021364400099 / 2 = 0.0450851068220005.
           For object 7 to be contained within surface 0, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.0450851068220005 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.0450851068220005
           -0.0899148931779995 <= x <= 0.0899148931779995
           
           And similarly for y.
           
           I also need to avoid collision with object 4, which is at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Object 4 has dimensions (0.07856657716148471, 0.07856657716148469).
           Object 4 occupies the space from x = -0.03928 to 0.03928 and y = -0.03928 to 0.03928.
           
           To avoid collision, the bounding box of object 7 must not overlap with the bounding box of object 4.
           This means that for object 7, its x range must be entirely above 0.03928 or entirely below -0.03928.
           Similarly for its y range.
           
           Let's consider possible placements for object 7.
           If object 7 is placed with its center at (x,y) and orientation 0:
           Its x-range is [x - 0.045085, x + 0.045085]
           Its y-range is [y - 0.045085, y + 0.045085]
           
           To avoid collision with object 4:
           Case 1: (x + 0.045085) < -0.03928 => x < -0.084365 (e.g., x = -0.085)
           Case 2: (x - 0.045085) > 0.03928 => x > 0.084365 (e.g., x = 0.085)
           Similar logic applies to y.
           
           Therefore, suitable non-colliding coordinates for the center of object 7 are, for example:
           (0.085, 0.085), (0.085, -0.085), (-0.085, 0.085), (-0.085, -0.085)
           (0.085, 0.0), (-0.085, 0.0), (0.0, 0.085), (0.0, -0.085)
           I'll also include some slightly smaller values to ensure they fit within the surface bounds. The maximum valid coordinate for object 7 is 0.0899. So 0.085 is a safe choice.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have learned about the following stable placements:
           - Object 4: (ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. Extents: (0.07856657716148471, 0.07856657716148469). Half-extents: ~0.03928. Occupies x in [-0.03928, 0.03928], y in [-0.03928, 0.03928].
           - Object 7: (ID: 7) -- 0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.085. Extents: (0.09017021364400099, 0.09017021364400096). Half-extents: ~0.04508. Occupies x in [0.085-0.04508, 0.085+0.04508] = [0.03992, 0.13008], y in [0.03992, 0.13008].
           
           Now I need to place object 5, which has dimensions (0.0987496696577248, 0.0987496696577248). This object is also square.
           The surface 0 remains the same: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           The new object (ID: 5) has a half-extent of 0.0987496696577248 / 2 = 0.0493748348288624.
           For object 5 to be contained within surface 0, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.0493748348288624 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.0493748348288624
           -0.0856251651711376 <= x <= 0.0856251651711376
           
           And similarly for y.
           
           I also need to avoid collision with object 4 and object 7.
           Object 4 occupies x in [-0.03928, 0.03928], y in [-0.03928, 0.03928].
           Object 7 occupies x in [0.03992, 0.13008], y in [0.03992, 0.13008].
           
           Let's consider placement for object 5. Its x-range is [x - 0.04937, x + 0.04937] and y-range is [y - 0.04937, y + 0.04937].
           
           To avoid collision with object 4 (center (0,0), half-extent ~0.03928):
           x-overlap: [x - 0.04937, x + 0.04937] vs [-0.03928, 0.03928]
           y-overlap: [y - 0.04937, y + 0.04937] vs [-0.03928, 0.03928]

           y-overlap: [y - 0.04937, y + 0.04937] vs [0.03992, 0.13008]
           
           Let's look for an empty corner, for instance, the bottom-left.
           The available space for object 5's x is [-0.0856, 0.0856].
           The available space for object 5's y is [-0.0856, 0.0856].
           
           Consider a placement in the bottom-left corner of the surface that avoids both object 4 and object 7.
           Object 4's bounding box starts at x = -0.03928, y = -0.03928.
           Object 7's bounding box starts at x = 0.03992, y = 0.03992.
           
           If we place object 5 in the bottom-left region:
           We need x + 0.04937 < -0.03928 => x < -0.08865 (This is too far to the left, max is -0.0856)
           This means object 5 cannot fully avoid object 4 if it's placed fully to the left of object 4 without going out of bounds.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the free space.
           Object 4 occupies roughly the center.
           Object 7 occupies the top-right corner.
           
           This leaves the top-left, bottom-left, bottom-right, and sections along the edges.
           
           Let's try placing object 5 in the bottom-left part of the surface.
           We need `x + 0.04937` to be less than the left edge of object 4 or `x - 0.04937` to be greater than the right edge of object 4.
           And `y + 0.04937` to be less than the bottom edge of object 4 or `y - 0.04937` to be greater than the top edge of object 4.
           
           Let's try to place object 5 in the bottom-left of the surface such that its right edge is at x = -0.03928 and its top edge is at y = -0.03928.
           This would mean x = -0.03928 - 0.04937 = -0.08865. This is slightly out of bounds (-0.0856).
           
           Let's try to place it at the max allowed values in x and y that avoid object 4.
           To avoid object 4's right side, x must be > 0.03928 + 0.04937 = 0.08865 (out of bounds for object 5, max 0.0856)
           To avoid object 4's left side, x must be < -0.03928 - 0.04937 = -0.08865 (out of bounds for object 5, min -0.0856)
           
           This means that object 5 is large enough that it *must* overlap with object 4's x-projection or y-projection if placed at (0,0).
           Let's analyze this more carefully.
           If object 5 is centered at (x_5, y_5), its AABB is [x_5 - hx_5, x_5 + hx_5] x [y_5 - hy_5, y_5 + hy_5].
           hx_5 = hy_5 = 0.04937.
           Surface bounds: [-0.135, 0.135] x [-0.135, 0.135].
           Valid range for x_5, y_5: [-0.0856, 0.0856].
           
           Object 4: AABB [-0.03928, 0.03928] x [-0.03928, 0.03928].
           Object 7: AABB [0.03992, 0.13008] x [0.03992, 0.13008].
           
           There are four quadrants for placements:
           1. Top-left: x < 0, y > 0
           2. Top-right: x > 0, y > 0
           3. Bottom-left: x < 0, y < 0
           4. Bottom-right: x > 0, y < 0
           
           Let's try top-left.
           We need x + hx_5 < -0.03928 => x < -0.03928 - 0.04937 = -0.08865. This is out of bounds for x.
           So object 5 cannot be placed entirely to the left of object 4.
           
           What if we try to place it such that its x range is within the x range of object 4 but its y range is outside? Or vice versa.
           
           Let's try placing object 5 in the bottom-right corner of the surface.
           The max x is 0.0856. The max y is 0.0856.
           Let's pick an (x,y) around (0.08, -0.08).
           
           Check collision with object 4 for center (0.08, -0.08):
           Object 5 AABB: [0.08-0.04937, 0.08+0.04937] = [0.03063, 0.12937]
           Object 5 AABB: [-0.08-0.04937, -0.08+0.04937] = [-0.12937, -0.03063]
           Object 4 AABB: [-0.03928, 0.03928] x [-0.03928, 0.03928].
           X-ranges [0.03063, 0.12937] and [-0.03928, 0.03928] do not overlap.
           Y-ranges [-0.12937, -0.03063] and [-0.03928, 0.03928] do not overlap.
           So, (0.08, -0.08) avoids object 4.
           
           Check collision with object 7 for center (0.08, -0.08):
           Object 5 AABB: [0.03063, 0.12937] x [-0.12937, -0.03063]
           Object 7 AABB: [0.03992, 0.13008] x [0.03992, 0.13008]
           X-ranges [0.03063, 0.12937] and [0.03992, 0.13008] *do overlap*. They overlap significantly.
           Y-ranges [-0.12937, -0.03063] and [0.03992, 0.13008] *do not overlap*.
           
           Since x-ranges overlap but y-ranges don't, there is no collision at (0.08, -0.08) with object 7.
           This placement (0.08, -0.08) works!
           
           Let's try other corners.
           How about the top-left corner, e.g., (-0.08, 0.08)?
           Object 5 AABB: [-0.08-0.04937, -0.08+0.04937] = [-0.12937, -0.03063]
           Object 5 AABB: [0.08-0.04937, 0.08+0.04937] = [0.03063, 0.12937]
           Object 4 AABB: [-0.03928, 0.03928] x [-0.03928, 0.03928].
           X-ranges [-0.12937, -0.03063] and [-0.03928, 0.03928] do not overlap.
           Y-ranges [0.03063, 0.12937] and [-0.03928, 0.03928] do not overlap.
           So, (-0.08, 0.08) avoids object 4.
           
           Check collision with object 7 for center (-0.08, 0.08):
           Object 5 AABB: [-0.12937, -0.03063] x [0.03063, 0.12937]
           Object 7 AABB: [0.03992, 0.13008] x [0.03992, 0.13008]
           X-ranges [-0.12937, -0.03063] and [0.03992, 0.13008] do not overlap.
           Y-ranges [0.03063, 0.12937] and [0.03992, 0.13008] *do overlap*.
           Since x-ranges don't overlap, there is no collision at (-0.08, 0.08) with object 7.
           This placement (-0.08, 0.08) works!
           
           I'll use these corner placements and vary them slightly.
           Max coordinates: 0.0856.
           So (0.08, -0.08) and (-0.08, 0.08) are good.
           I can also consider placing them along the edges.
           For example, (0.0, -0.08).
           Object 5 AABB: [-0.04937, 0.04937] x [-0.12937, -0.03063]
           Object 4 AABB: [-0.03928, 0.03928] x [-0.03928, 0.03928].
           X-ranges [-0.04937, 0.04937] and [-0.03928, 0.03928] *overlap*.
           Y-ranges [-0.12937, -0.03063] and [-0.03928, 0.03928] *do not overlap*. No collision with object 4.
           
           Object 7 AABB: [0.03992, 0.13008] x [0.03992, 0.13008]
           X-ranges [-0.04937, 0.04937] and [0.03992, 0.13008] *do overlap*.
           Y-ranges [-0.12937, -0.03063] and [0.03992, 0.13008] *do not overlap*. No collision with object 7.
           So (0.0, -0.08) also works!
           
           Similarly, (-0.08, 0.0), (0.08, 0.0), (0.0, 0.08) might not work depending on overlap with Object 4 or 7.
           Let's check (0.08, 0.0):
           Object 5 AABB: [0.03063, 0.12937] x [-0.04937, 0.04937]
           Object 4 AABB: [-0.03928, 0.03928] x [-0.03928, 0.03928].
           X-ranges [0.03063, 0.12937] and [-0.03928, 0.03928] do not overlap.
           Y-ranges [-0.04937, 0.04937] and [-0.03928, 0.03928] *do overlap*. No collision with object 4.
           
           Object 7 AABB: [0.03992, 0.13008] x [0.03992, 0.13008]
           X-ranges [0.03063, 0.12937] and [0.03992, 0.13008] *do overlap*.
           Y-ranges [-0.04937, 0.04937] and [0.03992, 0.13008] *do overlap*. This *is a collision* with object 7. So (0.08, 0.0) is not good.
           
           Need to be more careful.
           A collision occurs if (X_obj5_min < X_other_max AND X_obj5_max > X_other_min) AND (Y_obj5_min < Y_other_max AND Y_obj5_max > Y_other_min).
           
           Let's test (0.0, 0.08):
           Object 5 AABB: [-0.04937, 0.04937] x [0.03063, 0.12937]
           Object 4 AABB: [-0.03928, 0.03928] x [-0.03928, 0.03928].
           X-overlap: Yes. Y-overlap: No. No collision with object 4.
           
           Object 7 AABB: [0.03992, 0.13008] x [0.03992, 0.13008]
           X-overlap: Yes ([-0.04937, 0.04937] and [0.03992, 0.13008]).
           Y-overlap: Yes ([0.03063, 0.12937] and [0.03992, 0.13008]). This *is a collision* with object 7. So (0.0, 0.08) is not good.
           
           It looks like the top-right and bottom-left for object 5 are good because object 4 and 7 are in the center and top-right respectively.
           The available space is somewhat 'L' shaped.
           I'll stick to positions like (-0.08, 0.08), (0.08, -0.08), (0.0, -0.08), and a similar placement in the top-left area.
           How about a placement in the top-left portion, e.g., (-0.08, 0.08)? This worked.
           How about a placement in the bottom-left portion, e.g., (-0.08, -0.08)?
           Object 5 AABB: [-0.12937, -0.03063] x [-0.12937, -0.03063]
           Object 4 AABB: [-0.03928, 0.03928] x [-0.03928, 0.03928].
           X-overlap: No. Y-overlap: No. No collision with object 4.
           
           Object 7 AABB: [0.03992, 0.13008] x [0.03992, 0.13008]
           X-overlap: No. Y-overlap: No. No collision with object 7.
           So (-0.08, -0.08) also works!
           
           So the four corners are good, as long as they fit on the surface and avoid collision.
           Corner placements like (-0.08, -0.08), (-0.08, 0.08), (0.08, -0.08) should work.
           The top-right corner (0.08, 0.08) for object 5 would collide with object 7 as object 7 is already there.
           
           Okay, let's target (-0.08, -0.08), (-0.08, 0.08), (0.08, -0.08).
           And then some near-edge positions for variety.
           A position like (0.0, -0.08) worked. How about (-0.08, 0.0)?
           Object 5 AABB: [-0.12937, -0.03063] x [-0.04937, 0.04937]
           Object 4 AABB: [-0.03928, 0.03928] x [-0.03928, 0.03928].
           X-overlap: No. Y-overlap: Yes. No collision with object 4.
           
           Object 7 AABB: [0.03992, 0.13008] x [0.03992, 0.13008]
           X-overlap: No. Y-overlap: No. No collision with object 7.
           So (-0.08, 0.0) also works!
           
           I will generate placements using these 4 positions and varying angles.
           
           Placements:

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have learned about the following stable placements:
           - Object 4: (ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. Extents: (0.07856657716148471, 0.07856657716148469). Half-extents: ~0.03928. AABB: x in [-0.03928, 0.03928], y in [-0.03928, 0.03928].
           - Object 7: (ID: 7) -- 0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.085. Extents: (0.09017021364400099, 0.09017021364400096). Half-extents: ~0.04508. AABB: x in [0.085-0.04508, 0.085+0.04508] = [0.03992, 0.13008], y in [0.03992, 0.13008].
           - Object 5: (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, -0.08, -0.08. Extents: (0.0987496696577248, 0.0987496696577248). Half-extents: ~0.04937. AABB: x in [-0.08-0.04937, -0.08+0.04937] = [-0.12937, -0.03063], y in [-0.12937, -0.03063].
           
           Now I need to place object 6, which has dimensions (0.0987431156189873, 0.0987431156189873). This object is also square.
           The surface 0 remains the same: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           The new object (ID: 6) has a half-extent of 0.0987431156189873 / 2 = 0.04937155780949365. Let's call this `h6`.
           For object 6 to be contained within surface 0, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + `h6` <= x <= 0.135 - `h6`
           -0.135 + 0.04937155780949365 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.04937155780949365
           -0.08562844219050635 <= x <= 0.08562844219050635
           And similarly for y.
           
           I also need to avoid collision with objects 4, 7, and 5.
           Object 4 AABB: [-0.03928, 0.03928] x [-0.03928, 0.03928].
           Object 7 AABB: [0.03992, 0.13008] x [0.03992, 0.13008].
           Object 5 AABB: [-0.12937, -0.03063] x [-0.12937, -0.03063].
           
           Let's look for an empty spot.
           Object 4 is in the center.
           Object 7 is in the top-right.
           Object 5 is in the bottom-left.
           
           This leaves the top-left and bottom-right as potentially free areas, as well as space along the edges.
           
           Let's try placing object 6 in the top-left part of the surface.
           A candidate position for object 6's center could be (-0.08, 0.08).
           Let's check the AABB for object 6 if centered at (-0.08, 0.08) with half-extent h6 = 0.04937155780949365:
           AABB for Object 6: x in [-0.08 - h6, -0.08 + h6] = [-0.12937155, -0.03062844]
                            y in [0.08 - h6, 0.08 + h6] = [0.03062844, 0.12937155]
           
           Collision check with Object 4:
           Object 4 AABB: [-0.03928, 0.03928] x [-0.03928, 0.03928].
           Object 6 x-range: [-0.12937, -0.03063]. Object 4 x-range: [-0.03928, 0.03928]. They do not overlap (max of 6 is -0.03063, min of 4 is -0.03928, so 6 is to the left of 4).
           Object 6 y-range: [0.03063, 0.12937]. Object 4 y-range: [-0.03928, 0.03928]. They do not overlap (min of 6 is 0.03063, max of 4 is 0.03928, so 6 is above 4).
           No collision with Object 4.
           
           Collision check with Object 7:
           Object 7 AABB: [0.03992, 0.13008] x [0.03992, 0.13008].
           Object 6 x-range: [-0.12937, -0.03063]. Object 7 x-range: [0.03992, 0.13008]. They do not overlap.
           Object 6 y-range: [0.03063, 0.12937]. Object 7 y-range: [0.03992, 0.13008]. They *do overlap* (0.03992 is between 0.03063 and 0.12937, and 0.12937 is between 0.03992 and 0.13008).
           Since y-ranges overlap but x-ranges do not, there is *no collision* with Object 7.
           
           Collision check with Object 5:
           Object 5 AABB: [-0.12937, -0.03063] x [-0.12937, -0.03063].
           Object 6 x-range: [-0.12937, -0.03063]. Object 5 x-range: [-0.12937, -0.03063]. They *do overlap*.
           Object 6 y-range: [0.03063, 0.12937]. Object 5 y-range: [-0.12937, -0.03063]. They do not overlap.
           Since x-ranges overlap but y-ranges do not, there is *no collision* with Object 5.
           
           So, placing Object 6 at (-0.08, 0.08) is a valid placement.
           
           Let's try another corner: bottom-right.
           A candidate position for object 6's center could be (0.08, -0.08).
           AABB for Object 6: x in [0.08 - h6, 0.08 + h6] = [0.03062844, 0.12937155]
                            y in [-0.08 - h6, -0.08 + h6] = [-0.12937155, -0.03062844]
           
           Collision check with Object 4:
           Object 4 AABB: [-0.03928, 0.03928] x [-0.03928, 0.03928].
           Object 6 x-range: [0.03063, 0.12937]. Object 4 x-range: [-0.03928, 0.03928]. No overlap.
           Object 6 y-range: [-0.12937, -0.03063]. Object 4 y-range: [-0.03928, 0.03928]. No overlap.
           No collision with Object 4.
           
           Collision check with Object 7:
           Object 7 AABB: [0.03992, 0.13008] x [0.03992, 0.13008].
           Object 6 x-range: [0.03063, 0.12937]. Object 7 x-range: [0.03992, 0.13008]. They *do overlap*.
           Object 6 y-range: [-0.12937, -0.03063]. Object 7 y-range: [0.03992, 0.13008]. They do not overlap.
           No collision with Object 7.
           
           Collision check with Object 5:
           Object 5 AABB: [-0.12937, -0.03063] x [-0.12937, -0.03063].
           Object 6 x-range: [0.03063, 0.12937]. Object 5 x-range: [-0.12937, -0.03063]. No overlap.
           Object 6 y-range: [-0.12937, -0.03063]. Object 5 y-range: [-0.12937, -0.03063]. They *do overlap*.
           No collision with Object 5.
           
           So, placing Object 6 at (0.08, -0.08) is also a valid placement.
           
           I'll use these positions and some variations, and vary theta.
           
           Placements:
           (0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.08)
           (0, 0.0, 0.08, -0.08)
           (0, 0.0, -0.06, 0.06)
           (0, 0.0, 0.06, -0.06)
           (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.08) # Let's check this one carefully. Obj6 AABB: [-h6, h6] x [0.08-h6, 0.08+h6] = [-0.04937, 0.04937] x [0.03063, 0.12937]
                            # vs Obj4: [-0.03928, 0.03928] x [-0.03928, 0.03928] -> X overlap, Y no overlap. No collision.
                            # vs Obj7: [0.03992, 0.13008] x [0.03992, 0.13008] -> X overlap, Y overlap. Collision! (0.0, 0.08) is bad.
           
           Let's rethink this for object 6.
           The 'L' shape for the clear area:
           Area 1 (Top-Left): x from [-0.0856, -0.03063), y from (0.03063, 0.0856]. Center (-0.08, 0.08) is good.
           Area 2 (Bottom-Right): x from (0.03063, 0.0856], y from [-0.0856, -0.03063). Center (0.08, -0.08) is good.
           
           What about a "strip" in the middle along the Y-axis below the center object?
           X-range: If x is centered at 0, then Object 6 x-range is [-0.04937, 0.04937]. This overlaps with Object 4's x-range [-0.03928, 0.03928]. So for no collision, the y-ranges must not overlap.
           If center x is 0:
           For Object 4, y_6_min > 0.03928 or y_6_max < -0.03928.
              y_6_min = y - h6. y - h6 > 0.03928 => y > 0.03928 + h6 = 0.03928 + 0.04937 = 0.08865 (too high for surf 0.0856). So y cannot be above Object 4.
              y_6_max = y + h6. y + h6 < -0.03928 => y < -0.03928 - h6 = -0.03928 - 0.04937 = -0.08865 (too low for surf -0.0856). So y cannot be below Object 4 with its center at x=0.
           This means placing object 6 with x=0 results in a collision with object 4, because it's too big to fully avoid object 4's y-extent while also maintaining x=0 and staying within surface bounds.
           
           Let's re-evaluate all potential clear areas with object 6's half-extent h6 = 0.04937.
           Object 4: [-0.03928, 0.03928] x [-0.03928, 0.03928].
           Object 5: [-0.12937, -0.03063] x [-0.12937, -0.03063]. (Bottom-Left)
           Object 7: [0.03992, 0.13008] x [0.03992, 0.13008]. (Top-Right)
           
           Available areas:
           - Top-left: x from [-0.0856, -0.03063) and y from (0.03063, 0.0856]. This is the quadrant that avoids both object 4's and object 5's x-extent, and object 4's and object 7's y-extent.
             Example center: (-0.08, 0.08). Already verified this.
           - Bottom-right: x from (0.03063, 0.0856] and y from [-0.0856, -0.03063). This is the quadrant that avoids both object 4's and object 7's x-extent, and object 4's and object 5's y-extent.
             Example center: (0.08, -0.08). Already verified this.
           
           These are the main two distinct 'corners' available.
           Any position along the central axes (x=0 or y=0) would involve one of object 6's extents overlapping with object 4, and as previously calculated, object 6 is too large to completely clear object 4 if its center is on x=0 or y=0.
           Specifically, if x_center = 0, x_span is [-0.04937, 0.04937]. This overlaps with x_4_span [-0.03928, 0.03928]. So for no collision, the y_spans must not overlap.
           y_6_min > y_4_max (0.03928) or y_6_max < y_4_min (-0.03928).
           y_center - 0.04937 > 0.03928 => y_center > 0.08865. Max allowed y_center is 0.0856. Not possible.
           y_center + 0.04937 < -0.03928 => y_center < -0.08865. Min allowed y_center is -0.0856. Not possible.
           So, x_center cannot be 0. By symmetry, y_center cannot be 0 either.
           
           This limits me to the four "quadrants" where x_center and y_center are both non-zero.
           1. Top-left: x_center < 0, y_center > 0.
              Must avoid Object 5 (bottom-left): This means y_center - h6 > y_5_max (-0.03063) or x_center + h6 < x_5_min (-0.12937).
                 y_center - 0.04937 > -0.03063 => y_center > 0.01874.
              Must avoid Object 7 (top-right): This means y_center + h6 < y_7_min (0.03992) or x_center - h6 > x_7_max (0.13008).
                 x_center - 0.04937 > 0.13008 => x_center > 0.17945 (impossible, x_center < 0).
                 y_center + 0.04937 < 0.03992 => y_center < -0.00945 (impossible, y_center > 0).
              This means Object 7's x and y ranges will always overlap if x_center < 0 and y_center > 0 (unless one of the objects is very tiny), which means collision is avoided by ensuring that Object 6's AABB does not overlap on *both* axes.
              As verified earlier, at (-0.08, 0.08), Object 6 AABB is [-0.12937, -0.03063] x [0.03063, 0.12937].
              Object 7 AABB is [0.03992, 0.13008] x [0.03992, 0.13008].
              X-ranges: [-0.12937, -0.03063] and [0.03992, 0.13008]. No overlap. Good.
              This area is valid.
           
           2. Bottom-right: x_center > 0, y_center < 0.
              Must avoid Object 5 (bottom-left): This means x_center - h6 > x_5_max (-0.03063) or y_center + h6 < y_5_min (-0.12937).
                 x_center - 0.04937 > -0.03063 => x_center > 0.01874.
              Must avoid Object 7 (top-right): This means x_center + h6 < x_7_min (0.03992) or y_center - h6 > y_7_max (0.13008).
                 x_center + 0.04937 < 0.03992 => x_center < -0.00945 (impossible, x_center > 0).
                 y_center - 0.04937 > 0.13008 => y_center > 0.17945 (impossible, y_center < 0).
              Similar to the top-left, the collision with Object 7 is avoided by ensuring AABB's x-ranges don't overlap, which they don't for (0.08, -0.08).
              Object 6 AABB at (0.08, -0.08) is [0.03063, 0.12937] x [-0.12937, -0.03063].
              Object 7 AABB is [0.03992, 0.13008] x [0.03992, 0.13008].
              Y-ranges: [-0.12937, -0.03063] and [0.03992, 0.13008]. No overlap. Good.
              This area is valid.
           
           It seems I am limited to these two primary "L-shaped" areas. I will generate a variety of points within these two regions.
