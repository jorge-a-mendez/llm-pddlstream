(Thoughts: **Placing a Square Object on a Square Surface: A Robust Strategy**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing a square object (ID 5, roughly 0.099 x 0.099 units) on a square surface (Surface 0, 0.27 x 0.27 units centered at the origin). The goal is to generate 50 stable placements, considering both position (x, y) and orientation (theta). Here's my thought process:
           
           Since both the object and the surface are squares, the orientation plays a significant role in determining how well they fit. To ensure stability and maximize the usable area for the object's center, I'm going to leverage the properties of squares. The key is to recognize that a square's bounding box is minimized when aligned with the global coordinate axes. This means when theta is 0, pi/2 (90 degrees), pi (180 degrees), or 3pi/2 (270 degrees).
           
           Therefore, to cover a diverse set of placements and maximize stability, I'll generate placements with theta = 0 and theta = pi/2. For these orientations, the bounding box of the square object remains the same (0.09897931995354425 x 0.09897931995354425). This maximizes the valid range for the object's center (x, y) to -0.08551034 < x < 0.08551034 and -0.08551034 < y < 0.08551034.
           
           I'll divide this range into a 5x5 grid for both orientations, giving me a total of 50 placements.
           
           Specifically, I'll use the following (x, y) coordinate set:
           x_coords = [-0.085, -0.0425, 0.0, 0.0425, 0.085]
           y_coords = [-0.085, -0.0425, 0.0, 0.0425, 0.085]
           
           For each combination of (x, y) in the above set, I'll create placements both with theta = 0 and theta = pi/2, for a total of 50 placements. The goal is to maximize stability, by focusing on theta values that maintain minimum bounding box extents, for the full range of (x,y) co-ordinates, using the grid to get even coverage. These placements should be good because they ensure a diverse and stable set of placements on the surface.

(Thoughts: **Placing Object 4 on Surface 0: A Careful Strategy**
           
           Okay, so object 5 has been successfully placed, good to know. Now it's object 4's turn.  I've got the dimensions for object 4 (a square, about 0.096 units per side) and I'm targeting surface 0, which is also a square (0.27 units per side) centered at (0,0).  The task is to find 50 stable placements for object 4 on this surface, *without* it colliding with object 5.
           
           First things first, I need to get a clear picture of where object 5 *is* so I can stay clear. I've calculated its AABB using its given placement (`(0, 0.0, -0.085, -0.085)`) and dimensions. It turns out object 5 takes up the region  `[(-0.134, -0.134), (-0.035, -0.035)]`, nestled in the lower-left corner of the surface.
           
           Now, for object 4.  Since it's a square, I'll stick with 0 or pi/2 rotations (for maximum stability).  The surface's AABB is easy, `[(-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)]`.  Ignoring object 5 for now, the furthest I can push object 4's center coordinates are about -0.0869 and 0.0869 in both x and y.
           
           To avoid a tedious search, I'll use a grid of points as a starting point, but I know I'll need to tweak it because of the collision constraint.  I'm thinking of sampling points like I did before, in an array and then checking each. I did a similar operation in prior steps.
           
           Object 5's AABB is  `[(-0.134, -0.134), (-0.035, -0.035)]`.  Any valid placement for object 4  *must not* overlap with this region.
           
           I've written a quick collision check, it's something I've done often, to check if the AABBs of objects 4 and 5 are overlapping. The rule is simple: if the maximum extent of one object along an axis is greater than the minimum extent of the other, then they overlap on that axis.
           
           I've got a collision test, but I need to make some precise calculations for object 4. I know that the critical distance between object 4's center and object 5's is the sum of the half-extents, about 0.098 units. I then check all these points to see if the collision conditions were met, and discard those.
           
           The surface bounds and collision-avoidance conditions together lead to an important realization. I need to make sure the center of object 4 is not in the collision zone, based on the coordinates of the first object. Since I have 50 placements to find, I'll focus on locations outside that zone.
           
           So, I need to generate placement coordinates that *avoid* this collision zone. If my grid is in the upper right and lower left quadrants, and there's a forbidden region. I can easily determine a grid to test, then run the checks to confirm. I should have 56 possible placement coordinates, then, using either 0 or pi/2 for each point.
           
           I've written the routine to filter those points to yield 50 distinct positions.  I will take 25 points from theta=0 and 25 from theta=pi/2.
           
           I believe I can use the same technique I used with object 5, and the output is likely to be similar. All of these points should be within surface bounds and *guaranteed* to be collision-free.  This approach is efficient and should give me reliable placements.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Plan for 50 Stable Positions**
           
           Alright, here's the plan. I need to place Object 6, a square, in 50 stable positions on Surface 0.  My immediate concern is avoiding collisions with Object 5 and Object 4, which are already in place.  I'll stick with placing Object 6 at either a 0 or 90-degree angle (theta=0 or pi/2) to keep things simple and maximize the potential area.
           
           Object 6 has a side of roughly 0.097, so its half-extent is about 0.0485. Surface 0 has bounds of +/- 0.135 in both x and y.  Considering the object's size, its center must be within a smaller square, about +/-0.0864.
           
           Now, for the collisions. Object 5 is at roughly (-0.085, -0.085) and has a similar size, so any center of Object 6 that is within about 0.098 distance of (-0.085, -0.085) will collide with O5.  This creates a restricted region.
           
           Object 4 is at roughly (0.02, -0.08), and again, with its half extent, any center within ~0.097 will collide with O4.
           
           I calculated these zones and found the forbidden regions in the plane.
           
           Since I need 50, I decided to simplify things and restrict my approach to finding (x,y) pairs such that y > 0.02 (the y coordinate of O6's center), thus the points outside the 2 areas of collision for both objects, O4, and O5, are stable.
           
           I will use this logic to find a set of 17x7 = 119 potential positions, of which I will select the first 25 for theta=0, and the next 25 for theta=pi/2.
