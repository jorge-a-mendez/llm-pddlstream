User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with dimensions from -2.5 to 2.5 in both x and y. There's a central vertical wall along x=0. There are also several smaller rectangular obstacles scattered throughout the room, mostly concentrated in the upper quadrants.
           
           Given the target point at (-0.03823432168936906, -0.6277685652516624), I will propose positions within a radius of 2 from this point, avoiding the central wall and other visible obstacles. I'll prioritize positions with clear lines of sight.
           
           Positions:
           (0.5 -0.6)
           (-0.03 -2.0)
           (-1.5 -0.6)
