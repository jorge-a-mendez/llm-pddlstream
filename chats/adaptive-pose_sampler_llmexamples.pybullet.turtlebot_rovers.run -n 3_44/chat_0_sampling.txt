           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a central vertical wall at x = 0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered around the scene, including some in the corners and some along the central vertical wall and some in the middle sections. I will try to find positions for the robot that are within the allowed x and y ranges, within a distance of 2 from the target point. I will prioritize positions that are not too close to the known obstacles.

Model:     The previous positions failed because they collided with the boundary walls or were unreachable. I need to be more careful with the exact boundaries of the fixed obstacles. The first position collided with the top wall (obstacle 0: ((-2.55, 2.45), (2.55, 2.55))). The second collided with the left wall (obstacle 0: ((-2.55, -2.55), (-2.45, 2.55))). The third position was unreachable, likely due to being outside the allowed x/y range despite seeming valid. I will adjust my proposed positions to stay further away from the absolute boundaries and ensure they are within the [-2.5, 2.5] range.

Model:     The previous attempts to place the robot close to the upper and left boundaries resulted in collisions, even when trying to stay slightly away from the absolute limits. Specifically, `(-1.65, 2.3)` collided with the top wall (0) and also with obstacle 1 ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)), which is in the top-left quadrant. `(-2.3, 0.5)` collided with the left wall (0). It seems the definition of the boundary obstacles is quite strict, and I should leave more clearance. The target point is at `(-0.65, 1.99)`, which is in the upper-left quadrant. I need to find positions that avoid the walls and the block 1. I will try to stay further away from the known obstacles and walls.

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The previous attempts were for a target point (-0.65, 1.99), then (0.43, 2.00). The current target point is (-1.65, 0.5).
           My previous strategy of staying away from the boundaries was good, but I also collided with smaller obstacles. It seems "not reachable for robot base" means the position is outside the allowed x/y range, or too close to obstacles. For the target (0.426, 2.004), a position of (-0.65, 2.2) collided with obstacle 10 and 20. Obstacle 10 is ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)) and 20 is ((-0.7027, 1.9404), (-0.6038, 2.0393)). These are very close to the proposed point.
           
           Now, for the target point (-1.65, 0.5), which is in the lower-left quadrant. I need to avoid the left wall, bottom wall, and the central vertical wall (x=0). I also need to be mindful of obstacles 6 ((-2.4047, -2.3455), (-1.3953, -1.6544)) and 12 ((-2.4185, -1.2533), (-2.3060, -1.1408)) and 17 ((-1.812, 1.215), (-1.670, 1.357)) and 18 ((-0.242, -1.721), (-0.112, -1.590)).
           
           Considering a max_range of 2 from (-1.65, 0.5):
           x range: [-3.65, 0.35], but limited by [-2.5, 2.5] so [-2.5, 0.35]
           y range: [-1.5, 2.5], but limited by [-2.5, 2.5] so [-1.5, 2.5]
           
           I will try to place the robot in open areas, not too close to the obstacles.
           The area around (-1.65, 0.5) has some space.
           
           Positions:

           ```
           
           The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The previous target point was (-1.65, 0.5), and the proposed position (-1.8, 0.5) resulted in "no line of sight to target due to occlusion". It seems that for the next request the target point has changed to (-1.84, 2.07). The failure from (-1.8, 0.5) for target (-1.84, 2.07) is understandable, as these points are quite far apart and something is likely between them.
           
           Now, the target point is (-1.8447, 2.0784). This is in the top-left quadrant, close to obstacle 8 ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)), obstacle 19 ((-1.893, 2.030), (-1.796, 2.126)), and the upper-left walls.
           The max range of 2 means the robot base can be from x in [-3.8447, 0.1553] and y in [0.0784, 4.0784]. Considering the scene limits:
           x: [-2.5, 0.1553]
           y: [0.0784, 2.5]
           
           I need to be very careful around the top-left corner due to the high density of obstacles and the collision history.
           Obstacle 8: ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)) - the target point is very close to this obstacle.
           Obstacle 19: ((-1.893, 2.030), (-1.796, 2.126)) - the target point is inside this obstacle, or at least very, very close to its boundary.
           
           This means that the target point itself is extremely close to or inside fixed obstacles. This makes finding a clear line of sight and collision-free position very difficult.
           
           If the target point is inside an obstacle, no position will have line of sight. I will assume the target point is just outside the obstacle and I need to view it from a direction that avoids the obstacle. Given the target is at (-1.84, 2.07), and obstacle 8 and 19 are around it, I should try to view it from the bottom-left or bottom-right, or maybe from directly below or to the right.
           
           Let's try to place the robot in a clear area to the right or below the target, keeping in mind the max distance of 2.

           The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The previous target point was (-1.8447, 2.0784). It seems the provided feedback for specific proposed positions is not for the current target point, which is slightly confusing, but I will focus on the new target point provided in the current request.
           The previous proposed positions for the target point (-1.8447, 2.0784) were:
           (-1.0, 1.9) - Failed: not reachable for robot base
           (-1.8, 1.0) - Failed: no line of sight to target due to occlusion
           (-2.4, 1.9) - I don't have feedback for this one, but I should assume it's also likely problematic given the pattern of failures near this target.
           
           The current target point is still (-1.8447, 2.0784).
           The failure for (-1.0, 1.9) is "not reachable", which implies it's either out of bounds or too close to an obstacle. Let's re-examine that. X should be in [-2.5, 0.1553] and Y in [0.0784, 2.5]. (-1.0, 1.9) is within these bounds. It's likely an obstacle collision. Looking at the map, there's obstacle 10 ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)) and 20 ((-0.70, 1.94), (-0.60, 2.03)) near x=-1.0 and y=1.9, which could be the cause.
           
           The failure for (-1.8, 1.0) for the target (-1.8447, 2.0784) indicates occlusion. This means there's something between ( -1.8, 1.0) and (-1.8447, 2.0784). Looking at the obstacles, 17 ((-1.812, 1.215), (-1.670, 1.357)) could be the occluder, as it's directly between the two points.
           
           Given the target point (-1.8447, 2.0784) is in a dense area (near obstacles 8 and 19), and previous attempts from various directions have failed, I need to be strategic.
           To view this target, I need to avoid:
           *   Walls: (-2.55, 2.45) for top, (-2.55, -2.55) for left.
           *   Obstacle 8: ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25))
           *   Obstacle 19: ((-1.893, 2.030), (-1.796, 2.126)) - The target point is inside or immediately adjacent to this obstacle. This makes finding a clear line of sight extremely challenging. If the target is truly inside, no view is possible. I will assume it is on the edge.
           
           Let's try to view it from slightly different angles, ensuring some distance from the target and avoiding known obstacles.
           The target is at x=-1.84, y=2.07.
           Let's try moving around obstacle 8.
           To the left of obstacle 8: x < -2.25. So, let's try x around -2.3, y around 2.07.
           To the right of obstacle 8: x > -1.75. So, let's try x around -1.5, y around 2.07.
           Below obstacle 8: y < 1.75. So, let's try x around -1.84, y around 1.6.
           
           Positions:
           (-2.3 2.0)
           (-1.5 2.0)
           (-1.8 1.6)
