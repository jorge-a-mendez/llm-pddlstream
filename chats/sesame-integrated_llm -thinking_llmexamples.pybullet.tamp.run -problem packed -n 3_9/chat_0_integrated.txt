           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.157, -0.426), (0.246, -0.337)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.18, -0.401), (-0.087, -0.308)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.108, 0.466), (-0.031, 0.544)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.202, -0.381, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.986, -0.166).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.133, -0.354, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.215, 0.977).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.07, 0.505, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.667, 0.745).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **A Detailed Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get objects v8, v12, and v14 all *on* v16, specifically supported by it.  I've got the initial state, which tells me where everything *is*, and the target surface, v16, defined by its AABB. Right now, these objects are all perched on v11, which means I need to *move* them.
           
           The axiom I'm working with connects `on(?o, ?r)` with `supported(?o, ?p, ?r) AND atpose(?o, ?p)`. That's my guide. This screams "pick and place"!  I need to use `pick` and `place` actions with the robot arm, v4.
           
           I have a bit of a wrinkle, though. The `place` action requires a pose on the destination, v16, and the current state provides a `supported` and a `pose`.   This means I need to generate unique poses, not just rely on what is given. So, I need different continuous values in the form `#o2` for each object when it's placed on `v16`.
           
           My strategy is to move the robot base to the correct initial configuration, then pick each object and place it on v16.  This will be done sequentially.
           
           Here's the plan I came up with:
           1.  **Move the Base:** Since every pick and place action involving v4 uses base configuration #o3, I start by doing `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`. That gets the robot in the right position.
           
           2.  **Object v8:**
               *   Pick v8 from its initial position on v11 (`v9`). This is `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)`.
               *   Place v8 onto v16 at position `p_v8_v16 = (0.0, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           
           3.  **Object v12:**
               *   Pick v12 from its initial position on v11 (`v13`). This is `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)`.
               *   Place v12 onto v16 at position `p_v12_v16 = (0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           
           4.  **Object v14:**
               *   Pick v14 from its initial position on v11 (`v15`). This is `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4)`.
               *   Place v14 onto v16 at position `p_v14_v16 = (0.0, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           
           I had to be careful here in choosing the placement, so I checked the objects' dimensions.  For collision-free and stable placement, I'm setting the y coordinate to be within the bounds of v16, the z to be the initial z, and for simplicity, theta is set to 0.  I am assuming, as stated in the text that any facts not explicitly stated are false, and the unsafe facts are indeed not true.  Also, it would seem that the problem is not about achieving a precise arrangement, as all three object placements are not at the same pose, per se, as `#o2` in place.
           This plan puts each object on v16, and gets me to my goal of `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`. The final cost will be a function of the distance required by moving the base plus the costs of the pick and place actions.
