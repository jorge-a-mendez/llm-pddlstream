           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of Achieving new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is `new-axiom@0()`.  First, I expand that predicate, and it requires a conjunction of conditions.  Four of them are already true in the initial state (`atconf`, `free`). The real challenge lies in the other conditions: `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`.
           
           To get `receivedimage`, I'd need to use `take_image` followed by `send_image`. But the preconditions for those actions involve being *calibrated*, *having an image*, and being able to *communicate* which are currently not true. To get `receivedanalysis`, I need `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`. However, my analysis actions are not available.
           
           The *available* actions are laughably limited: basically moving to my current location or dropping a rock. Dropping rocks is useless because my storage is empty.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`, I'd need to first calibrate my camera, which requires the action `calibrate` and then I'd need to take an image, action `take_image` and send the image, which is `send_image`.
           
           For the `receivedanalysis` conditions, I would need to *sample* a rock of the correct type and *send* the analysis. This necessitates the `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` actions.
           
           However, the provided list of *permitted* actions explicitly excludes all of these necessary actions. In fact, the only *valid* actions are essentially null operations: moving to the same position or dropping rocks when I cannot because my storage is empty.
           
           Therefore, because I can't *act* to satisfy the *preconditions* to those required actions, it is impossible for me to achieve the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` conditions. So, it appears that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently *unreachable* given the strict set of constraints on my actions. The system is designed such that this goal is not achievable in its current state.
