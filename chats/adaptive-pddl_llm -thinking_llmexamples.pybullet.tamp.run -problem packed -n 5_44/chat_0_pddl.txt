           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v20)
               Atom on(v12, v20)
               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unattainable Goal Due to Action Restrictions**
           
           Okay, I've got a clear objective: get all these objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) onto v20.  Currently, they're all on v11.  My understanding of the world is solid: I know that an object is "on" another if it's "supported" and "atpose".  Looking at the initial state, everything is supported by v11, and the facts are already "on(v8,v11)", "on(v12,v11)", and so on.
           
           The only way I can change this "on" relationship is by using the "pick" and "place" actions.  I need to grab each object, move it, and put it on v20. The facts I need are all there: `graspable`, `supported`, `atpose`, and so on.
           
           The problem, as I see it, comes down to my available actions.  I'm only given a *single* action instance: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. The task description is explicit: if an action isn't *explicitly* provided as an instance, it's not allowed.  And the initial state doesn't have `kin` facts, which would be necessary to generate these instances.
           
           So, I'm left with no way to pick up an object from its pose, and place it. Given that I can't modify the configuration to my liking, the goal is unreachable.  I'm stuck.
