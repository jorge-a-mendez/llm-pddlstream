           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Here's how I'm thinking about this placement problem:**
           
           I need to find 50 stable positions for a small, almost-square object (ID 5, dimensions 0.07 x 0.07) on a rectangular surface (Surface 0, defined by `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`). A stable placement means the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) is entirely within the surface's AABB.  A placement is defined by (surface_index, rotation, x, y).
           
           Since the object is very small relative to the surface (0.07 vs. 0.6 in width and height), there are potentially many valid placements.  I'm going to generate a grid-like structure to cover the available area, aiming for a diverse set of positions and rotations.  Rotation is important: although the object is nearly square, I need to account for possible rotations to ensure stability.
           
           My first step is to establish the constraints for the object's center (x, y).  Because I'm concerned about *stability* (full containment), I need to calculate the allowable range for the center of the object, which is going to be within the bounds of the surface, offset by half the size of the object's bounding box. So I need to use the dimensions of the object with rotation to calculate the padding.
           
           For a square object, the AABB size stays constant regardless of rotation if measured in its local frame but can change if measured in world space for rotations. The width and height of the world aligned AABB will be different for different rotation angles. The *minimal* world-aligned AABB's dimensions *does* change with theta, so I need to account for this to ensure full containment. Because I need to find the area for where the AABB can be placed, I'm going to use the maximum bound of the rotated box's AABB for padding.
           
           Let's do this calculation: given surface lower/upper and object's side length `s = 0.07`:
           I will also need to rotate the object at a few `theta` values. Then, to place the center (x, y) coordinates, the ranges will be set for a grid in that specific area. Then calculate 50 placement points.
           
           I will use 4 `theta`s: `0`, `pi/8`, `pi/4`, and `3pi/8`.  This will give a good coverage. For each `theta`, I will calculate the minimal possible dimensions, generate the `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, `max_y` range and make a grid with these. Then I should take at most 50 placements.
           
           Now I am ready to implement the grid generation.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Avoiding Collisions**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with finding 50 stable, collision-free placements for a new, almost-square object (ID 10, dimensions ~0.0777 x 0.0777) on a given surface (0). I already know the location of a previously placed object (ID 5: center (4.235, -0.565), dimensions 0.07 x 0.07, rotation 0 radians), and I need to avoid any overlap with it. The surface area is pretty straightforward, ranging from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0).
           
           First, I calculated the Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) for the existing object (ID 5), which is at (4.2, -0.6) to (4.27, -0.53) because it's square and has no rotation. This tells me the area I need to avoid.
           
           For my approach, I need to generate placements for the new object and check the generated points for stability and collisions. The code generates positions on the surface for the object, and then calculates the AABB of the potential new object. Then it checks if the new object, with its generated placement, overlaps the already placed object's AABB.
           
           To ensure stability, I'm making sure that the generated centers for the object lie within the given surface area after accounting for the object's dimensions and rotation.
           
           The key to preventing collisions is this:  I calculate the AABB of the new object (ID 10) for each potential center point and check if it intersects with the AABB of the existing object (ID 5). No intersection, no collision, and that placement is good! The condition for no collision, as I've written, translates to a simple bounding box check.
           
           Because the object is nearly a square, I can calculate `W_world` and `H_world` using absolute values and trigonometric functions with its current theta value.
           I will generate placements for multiple orientations, and filter out those placements that result in overlap. The new function takes into account how a rotated object interacts with a rectangular surface.
           
           I'm generating grid-like coordinates and applying collision checks. My goal here is to make sure I don't place something that's going to cause a collision, and also that I can create exactly 50 placements. I'm taking the intersection of "valid surface" and "not colliding" spaces to find good points. If 50 points are not found, I will increase number of points to sample or try a wider search. I am ready to return 50 stable placements!
