           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable: A Deep Dive into Rovers' Predicament**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, but after carefully dissecting the conditions, it's clear we're in a bit of a pickle. The goal is two-fold:  get those images received and analyze those samples.
           
           **Part 1: The Image Impasse**
           
           To satisfy `receivedimage`, we need to first *get* those images using `calibrate`, `take_image`, and then `send_image`.  But here's the rub: both rovers, `v12` and `v14`, are stuck in their starting configurations. Their available "move" actions don't *actually* move them; they're essentially self-loops. For `calibrate` and `take_image` to work, they need to be at the location where the objects are visible (`#o3`). However, the `move` actions prevent either rover from reaching this necessary configuration. Consequently, we can't get `haveimage`, and therefore, `receivedimage` is out of reach for any of the objectives.
           
           **Part 2: The Sampling Stalemate**
           
           Moving on to analyses, to achieve `receivedanalysis`, we need to sample rocks using `sample_rock` and then send those analyses using `send_analysis`. The hitch here is that the rocks we need to analyze are "above" different locations (`#o5` specifically), but the rovers can't reach those locations either. Neither `v12` nor `v14` can change their configuration to be at `#o5`, as both rovers are configured to be at locations other than `#o5` in the initial state. Since both rovers are stuck, `sample_rock` can't be executed, so `analyzed` remains unachievable. This means analyses, and therefore `receivedanalysis`, also cannot be reached.
           
           **Conclusion: A Plan with No Path**
           
           In essence, we are blocked on both counts. Both of our rovers are trapped, making all required image acquisitions and sample analyses impossible. Therefore, I conclude that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently **unachievable** with the provided initial state and available actions. The key lies in the limited move actions, rendering the rovers incapable of taking any of the required steps. This is a classic example of a planning problem where constraints on actions lead to a deadlock.
