           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Unreachability Analysis**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. Examining the axiom's structure, it's clear that it consists of several core requirements: rovers need to be in specific configurations, the store must be free, and both images and analyses must be *received*.  I observe that the initial state satisfies the rover configuration and store availability conditions. The challenge lies in receiving images and analyses, which, fundamentally, require specific actions outside the given action set.
           
           To analyze this further, let's break down the necessary steps. For image reception (`receivedimage`),  I would require the rover to `send_image`, which, in turn, needs the rover to take the image with `take_image` and calibrate with `calibrate`. Similarly, for analysis reception (`receivedanalysis`), I'd require `send_analysis`, achieved by `sample_rock`.
           
           The crux of the matter is the provided set of allowable actions, which includes only `move` and `drop_rock`. These actions are insufficient. Since `move` is a no-op in this case and `drop_rock` has unmet preconditions, I can't fulfill any condition for image or analysis reception. The actions of calibration, taking images, sending images, sampling rocks, and sending analyses are all absent.
           
           Thus, given the defined action space, the goal, specifically the conjuncts related to image and analysis reception, is fundamentally unachievable. No plan can possibly succeed. Consequently, I must conclude that the overall goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable with the given action set.
