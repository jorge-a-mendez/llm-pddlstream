           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point is (0.9168058253138871, 0.528416801948496).
           The fixed obstacles are mostly on the perimeter of the [-2.5, 2.5] x [-2.5, 2.5] square, and then a few scattered within. There are some pillars at x=0, and some smaller boxes in the corners and other locations. I will try to place the robot in a circle around the target point with radius 1.5, to maximize the distance from the target while still being within the 2-unit range. I will try to avoid the known obstacles.

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point is (0.6395795345306396, 1.8958196640014648).
           My previous attempts at (-2.479769363063539, 0.2335028784974017) collided with obstacle 4, which is the wall at x=-2.5. My other attempts had no line of sight, likely due to obstacles near the target point.
           Let's analyze the obstacles near the target point (0.639, 1.895):
           Obstacle 9: ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)) is very close to the target, almost enclosing it from multiple sides.
           Obstacle 10: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)) is to the west of the target.
           Obstacle 19: ((-0.5361162306199541, 2.0758605717291365), (-0.46427131878037553, 2.147705483568715)) is to the north-west of the target.
           Obstacle 20: ((0.6007075551727987, 1.856947684643624), (0.6784515138884806, 1.9346916433593058)) is extremely close to the target point, essentially surrounding it. This is probably the cause of the line-of-sight issues.
           
           Given the density of obstacles around the target, I will try to place the robot further away, but still within the 2-unit range. I'll focus on areas to the south and east where there seem to be fewer obstacles, and specifically avoid being directly behind obstacle 9 or 20 relative to the target.

Model:     The target point is (-0.5001937747001648, 2.111783027648926).
           My previous attempts around (0.639, 1.895) failed for line of sight, and one collided. The new target point is (-0.500, 2.111).
           Let's analyze obstacles near the target point:
           Obstacle 10: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)) is very close to the target point, likely causing occlusions.
           Obstacle 19: ((-0.5361162306199541, 2.0758605717291365), (-0.46427131878037553, 2.147705483568715)) is also very close to the target, practically enclosing it.
           Obstacle 5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)) is the central vertical pillar, which collided with one of my previous positions.
           
           The target is heavily obstructed by obstacle 10 and 19. I need to find a position that can see around these. I will try positions that are further away and attempt to get a clear line of sight, perhaps to the west or south-west.
