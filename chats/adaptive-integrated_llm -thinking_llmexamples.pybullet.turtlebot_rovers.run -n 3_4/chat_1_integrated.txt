           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Planning**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is to achieve a new axiom, and to do this I need to form a plan. The axiom is quite specific: I need to take pictures, send them, sample some rocks, analyze them, and transmit the analysis. It looks like my resources are two rovers, v12 and v14, both equipped with cameras and communication systems. The key is that I need *received* images and analyses, which means I have to take images, send them, sample rocks/soil, and then transmit the analyses.
           
           **Detailed Breakdown of Actions**
           
           First, I need to get the images. To capture images, I need to be in a configuration where my camera can "see" the targets (v17, v18, v19). I'll start with v12 and use its camera, denoted by v10 and operating with mode v11. The action `take_image` does the trick, but it requires that the rover is calibrated. The way I calibrate the camera is with `calibrate`. I'll need to send the images using `send_image`, but the rover needs to be in a comms-accessible configuration.
           
           To get the analyses, I need to sample rocks. I can do that using `sample_rock`. The sampling will also create the `analyzed` predicate, and `send_analysis` will let me transmit it. The sampling action relies on being "above" a rock. I need to make sure I'm "free" too, meaning my store must be empty.
           
           The initial state reveals a bunch of `atconf` (at a configuration), `free`, etc., and the goal is to make a `conjunction` of these items true. So, let's make a plan to do all that.
           
           **Image Acquisition Strategy**
           
           My plan will be as follows:
           v12 has to move to take the images, and then move back to send the images.
           I’ll move v12 to three different `#o3` (imaging) locations to image the three objects. To then move to another location to comm. I'll need to repeat move-calibrate-take three times, once for each object in order to build up the have image. Then the comm. I'll do the same to collect two different soil and stones. The sample_rock makes me full, so I then have to drop before I can sample another rock.
           
           First, I'll move v12 from initial config `v13` to `#o3`, and then I will move it to the location to comm. So I will move the rover to the correct spot for each image acquisition. The `conf` parameter is something I need to keep track of.
           
           **Sampling and Analysis Plan**
           
           To get the analyses, I will have to move the rover above the rock. To satisfy the goal to find different stones and soil, I will collect the rock.
           
           To send analyses, I'll move to the comm config, send the analysis, drop the rock. Then I go back to the starting config at `v13`.
           
           **Configuration Considerations**
           I need to be very careful to only provide config values for objects used within an `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicates. This means I'll need to provide continuous values for `#o0` (comms) and `#o3` (images). The question of `#o5` is debatable, but I decided that it doesn't need to be defined. I'll stick with `#o5` as a symbolic marker.
           
           **Final Plan and Configurations**
           
           Here's my full plan:
           1.  Move v12 from `v13` to `#o3`
           2.  Calibrate v10 at `#o3` for v17.
           3.  Take image of v17.
           4.  Move v12 to `#o3` to image v18.
           5.  Calibrate v10 at `#o3` for v18.
           6.  Take image of v18.
           7.  Move v12 to `#o3` to image v19.
           8.  Calibrate v10 at `#o3` for v19.
           9.  Take image of v19.
           10. Move v12 to `#o0`
           11. Send image of v17
           12. Send image of v18
           13. Send image of v19
           14. Move v12 to `#o5` (above the rocks)
           15. Sample rock/soil v3 with the rover.
           16. Drop the rock.
           17. Sample rock/soil v5 with the rover.
           18.

           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is to achieve a new axiom, and to do this I need to form a plan. The axiom is quite specific: I need to take pictures, send them, sample some rocks, analyze them, and transmit the analysis. It looks like my resources are two rovers, v12 and v14, both equipped with cameras and communication systems. The key is that I need *received* images and analyses, which means I have to take images, send them, sample rocks/soil, and then transmit the analyses.
           
           **Detailed Breakdown of Actions**
           
           First, I need to get the images. To capture images, I need to be in a configuration where my camera can "see" the targets (v17, v18, v19). I'll start with v12 and use its camera, denoted by v10 and operating with mode v11. The action `take_image` does the trick, but it requires that the rover is calibrated. The way I calibrate the camera is with `calibrate`. I'll need to send the images using `send_image`, but the rover needs to be in a comms-accessible configuration.
           
           To get the analyses, I need to sample rocks. I can do that using `sample_rock`. The sampling will also create the `analyzed` predicate, and `send_analysis` will let me transmit it. The sampling action relies on being "above" a rock. I need to make sure I'm "free" too, meaning my store must be empty.
           
           The initial state reveals a bunch of `atconf` (at a configuration), `free`, etc., and the goal is to make a `conjunction` of these items true. So, let's make a plan to do all that.
           
           **Image Acquisition Strategy**
           
           My plan will be as follows:
           v12 has to move to take the images, and then move back to send the images.
           I’ll move v12 to three different `#o3` (imaging) locations to image the three objects. To then move to another location to comm. I'll need to repeat move-calibrate-take three times, once for each object in order to build up the have image. Then the comm. I'll do the same to collect two different soil and stones. The sample_rock makes me full, so I then have to drop before I can sample another rock.
           
           First, I'll move v12 from initial config `v13` to `#o3`, and then I will move it to the location to comm. So I will move the rover to the correct spot for each image acquisition. The `conf` parameter is something I need to keep track of.
           
           **Sampling and Analysis Plan**
           
           To get the analyses, I will have to move the rover above the rock. To satisfy the goal to find different stones and soil, I will collect the rock.
           
           To send analyses, I'll move to the comm config, send the analysis, drop the rock. Then I go back to the starting config at `v13`.
           
           **Configuration Considerations**
           I need to be very careful to only provide config values for objects used within an `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicates. This means I'll need to provide continuous values for `#o0` (comms) and `#o3` (images). The question of `#o5` is debatable, but I decided that it doesn't need to be defined. I'll stick with `#o5` as a symbolic marker.
           
           **Final Plan and Configurations**
           
           Here's my full plan:
           1.  Move v12 from `v13` to `#o3`
           2.  Calibrate v10 at `#o3` for v17.
           3.  Take image of v17.
           4.  Move v12 to `#o3` to image v18.
           5.  Calibrate v10 at `#o3` for v18.
           6.  Take image of v18.
           7.  Move v12 to `#o3` to image v19.
           8.  Calibrate v10 at `#o3` for v19.
           9.  Take image of v19.
           10. Move v12 to `#o0`
           11. Send image of v17
           12. Send image of v18
           13. Send image of v19
           14. Move v12 to `#o5` (above the rocks)
           15. Sample rock/soil v3 with the rover.
           16. Drop the rock.
           17. Sample rock/soil v5 with the rover.
           18.

(Thoughts: **Refined Plan for Efficient Data Collection**
           
           Okay, so I've been given feedback that my previous plans for the rover's movements weren't quite right. Apparently, some of the configurations I suggested were either impossible to reach or would cause the rover to bump into things. So, I need to take another look at the continuous values I'm assigning to those abstract positions, represented by things like `#o0` and `#o3`, keeping in mind all those obstacles and making sure the rover can actually *get* to where it needs to go.
           
           The mission is still the same: I need to get images of three different objectives (`v17`, `v18`, and `v19`) and send them to the lander (`v9`), while also collecting and analyzing rock and soil samples. The rover `v12` is the main one for this, which starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           To solve this, I'm going to rethink the configuration settings and plan based on the information I have:
           
           1.  **Communication Setup (`#o0`):** I want to set up communications with the lander. The lander is at the center `(-1.9, -2.0)`. Considering the positioning of a large obstacle (`v21`) that is an obstacle at `x = 0.0` with the range of x `-0.05` to `0.05`. My original plan had a value for communication (`#o0`) was colliding with it. Now I am choosing a value for `x = 0.2`, so the rover `v12` has to be in between the initial and final position. That means my coordinates have to be `(0.2, -1.75)`. That has a good range and is easy for the rover to traverse.
           
           2.  **Imaging Configurations (`#o3`):**  I have to take pictures of three objects `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`. I am going to have the plan be that `v12` travels to three separate locations, each with the best position to take the image. I have to avoid obstacle `v20`.
               *   For `v17`, which has a center around `(-1.85, 1.93)`, I'm going to position the rover at the coordinates `(-1.5, 0.5)`. This should allow a good line of sight and avoid the obstacle.
               *   For `v18`, positioned around `(-0.51, 1.81)`, I'm planning to move the rover to the configuration `(0.0, 0.5)`. This also will avoid `v20`.
               *   For `v19`, around `(2.0, 1.82)`, I'll position the rover at `(1.5, 0.5)`. This position is also free of the obstacle `v20`.
           3.  **Sampling (`#o5`):** I need to sample some rocks. I still don't need to specify coordinates here, as the problem statement doesn't specify any specific rules here.
           
           **Putting It All Together:**
           
           Based on this, my plan will be:
           
           1.  Move from `v13` (current position) to `(-1.5, 0.5)` to image `v17`.
           2.  Calibrate the camera and take the image of `v17`.
           3.  Move from `(-1.5, 0.5)` to `(0.0, 0.5)` to image `v18`.
           4.  Calibrate for `v18` and take an image.
           5.  Move from `(0.0, 0.5)` to `(1.5, 0.5)` to image `v19`.
           6.  Calibrate for `v19` and take an image.
           7.  Move from the last image configuration to communication position `(0.2, -1.75)`.
           8.  Send the images.
           9.  Move to the sampling location `#o5` which isn't yet specified (but I assume reachable).
           10. Collect samples.
           11. Return to the original communication position, i.e., `(0.2, -1.75)`.
           12. Transmit the rock analysis.
           13. Return to the starting location `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           This plan should make the best use of the rover's movements. Also, I assume that I can move with

(Thoughts: **Rethinking Continuous Configurations**
           
           Based on the feedback, I need to revisit the continuous configurations, specifically for `#o0` (communication) and `#o3` (imaging). I need to ensure these are reachable from the previous configuration, collision-free, occlusion-free, and within the required range. The robot starts at (1.0, -1.75).
           
           **Imaging `v17`**: Previous position at `(-1.5, 0.5)` was unreachable, likely due to the vertical obstacle at x=0. To avoid this, and the small box at x=-0.44, I'll try `(-1.0, 1.0)`. It's within range (2m) and reachable via (1.0, -2.0) -> (0.1, -2.0) -> (-0.1, -2.0) -> (-1.0, -2.0) -> (-1.0, 1.0), which I am confident I can handle.
           
           **Imaging `v18`**: Since the target is also in the negative x-region, from the previous image, I'll try `(-0.5, 1.0)`. It is within 2m.
           
           **Imaging `v19`**: This target is in the upper-right quadrant. From `(-0.5, 1.0)`, let's try `(1.5, 1.0)`. This crosses the x=0 line but can be handled via (-0.5, 1.0) -> (-0.1, 1.0) -> (0.1, 1.0) -> (1.5, 1.0).
           
           **Communication with Lander `v9`**:  The previous attempt at (0.2, -1.75) collided with the obstacle. I will try `(-1.0, -1.75)`. It's within range (4m), clear of the x=0 obstacle, and can be reached via a detour.
           
           **Sampling** `#o5` requires no coordinate change.
           
           I've made sure to revise the plan so that all coordinates are collision-free.
           
           I'm confident these revised configurations will enable successful execution, including communication and obstacle navigation.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Impossible Goal**
           
           Okay, here's the deal: I've been at this `new-axiom@0()` goal in the `rovers` domain for a while now, and I'm hitting a wall, literally. I keep running into invalid configurations – things like not being able to reach specific spots, collisions, or being blocked. The main obstacle here is this vertical wall, `v21`.  It's positioned along the Y-axis (around x=0), and it's making life difficult. 
           
           The goal? Well, it's pretty straightforward on the surface: get two rovers in the right places, collect and transmit some image and analysis data.  But, it's the *how* that's tripping me up.
           
           The initial state is straightforward enough. We've got two rovers, v12 and v14, starting at known locations and ready to get to work. We've also got some key locations defined, where they can take and receive images/analysis. Also, we know the approximate location of the lander (`v9`). There are also some interesting landmarks: locations of rocks and soil that we need to analyze.
           
           The problem? `v12` starts on the right side of that darn wall at (1.0, -1.75). From that starting point, `v12` needs to image several targets (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`), and then communicate the results to `v9`. `v12` has the camera `v10` and should be able to get `v19` on the right-hand side. The soil sample (`v5`) is also on the right-hand side, so `v12` should also be able to collect that sample.
           
           The wall is a serious constraint. It is represented by an AABB: `((-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), (0.05, 2.5, 0.1))`.  Essentially, the wall extends vertically along x=0. The problem statement says "collision-free", so it's a barrier.
           
           It looks like, `v14` needs to be doing much more of the work. `v14` starts at (-1.0, -1.75), which means it's on the left side of the wall. That's good, because targets `v17`, `v18`, `v3` can be imaged by `v14` as well. That also solves some of the communication issues, since `v14` can communicate from the left side of the wall.
           
           So, the plan *should* be:
           
           *   **Rover v14**: Image and process `v17` and `v18`, analyze and transmit to `v9`.

Model:     **Re-evaluating the Impossible Goal**
           
           Okay, here's the deal: I've been at this `new-axiom@0()` goal in the `rovers` domain for a while now, and I'm hitting a wall, literally. I keep running into invalid configurations – things like not being able to reach specific spots, collisions, or being blocked. The main obstacle here is this vertical wall, `v21`.  It's positioned along the Y-axis (around x=0), and it's making life difficult. 
           
           The goal? Well, it's pretty straightforward on the surface: get two rovers in the right places, collect and transmit some image and analysis data.  But, it's the *how* that's tripping me up.
           
           The initial state is straightforward enough. We've got two rovers, v12 and v14, starting at known locations and ready to get to work. We've also got some key locations defined, where they can take and receive images/analysis. Also, we know the approximate location of the lander (`v9`). There are also some interesting landmarks: locations of rocks and soil that we need to analyze.
           
           The problem? `v12` starts on the right side of that darn wall at (1.0, -1.75). From that starting point, `v12` needs to image several targets (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`), and then communicate the results to `v9`. `v12` has the camera `v10` and should be able to get `v19` on the right-hand side. The soil sample (`v5`) is also on the right-hand side, so `v12` should also be able to collect that sample.
           
           The wall is a serious constraint. It is represented by an AABB: `((-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), (0.05, 2.5, 0.1))`.  Essentially, the wall extends vertically along x=0. The problem statement says "collision-free", so it's a barrier.
           
           It looks like, `v14` needs to be doing much more of the work. `v14` starts at (-1.0, -1.75), which means it's on the left side of the wall. That's good, because targets `v17`, `v18`, `v3` can be imaged by `v14` as well. That also solves some of the communication issues, since `v14` can communicate from the left side of the wall.
           
           So, the plan *should* be:
           
           *   **Rover v14**: Image and process `v17` and `v18`, analyze and transmit to `v9`.
           *   **Rover v12**: Image `v19` and collect/analyze `v5`. *But now the issue is communication!*
           
           The problem boils down to **communication.** `v12` cannot send its images and analysis to the lander on the *other* side of the wall.
           
           I've checked the PDDL for the `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, and it requires a direct line of sight. Given the way the wall is defined, `v12` *cannot* directly communicate to `v9`.
           
           So, the whole plan is completely blocked. It's impossible. No matter what, `v12` *has* to share information with `v9` to reach the goal.
           
           **In summary, there's no solution. The objective is currently unattainable, because v12 can't cross the barrier to send its results.**
