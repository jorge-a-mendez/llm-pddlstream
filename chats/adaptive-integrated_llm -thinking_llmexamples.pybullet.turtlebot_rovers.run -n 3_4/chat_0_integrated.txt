           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning:**
           
           I'm tasked with devising a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()` within the given `rovers` PDDL domain. This goal is a conjunction of several conditions: rovers at specific configurations, stores being free, and receiving images and analyses.
           
           I started by thoroughly analyzing the goal's requirements, specifically breaking down each condition (like `atconf`, `free`, `receivedimage`, and `receivedanalysis`). Then, I scrutinized the initial state to see which conditions are already satisfied and which need to be achieved.
           
           Crucially, I noticed the preconditions for achieving the "received" predicates (image and analysis) include actions *not* in the permitted action instances list. This immediately raised a red flag. Only trivial `move` actions (that don't change config) and inapplicable `drop_rock` actions were allowed.
           
           Given these severe constraints – no actions to generate the required *effects* and an *extremely limited* action list – the goal appears unsolvable. The permissible actions cannot produce the states necessary for achieving the goal, specifically the received images/analysis. Even assuming the *implicit flexibility* of configurations (#o3, #o0, #o5) based on their presence in the initial state with respect to the initial atconf locations doesn't make this achievable.
           
           My conclusion is that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable with the given constraints and available actions. Therefore, I can't generate a plan.
