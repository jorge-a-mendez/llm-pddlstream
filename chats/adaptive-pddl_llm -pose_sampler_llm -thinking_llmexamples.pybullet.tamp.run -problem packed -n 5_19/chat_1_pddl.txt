           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Dissection**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a planning problem. My overarching goal is to achieve `on(v8, v20)`, `on(v12, v20)`, `on(v14, v20)`, `on(v16, v20)`, and `on(v18, v20)`.  Essentially, I need to get five objects onto a specific surface, `v20`.  Initially, these objects are all sitting on `v11`.
           
           I'm given a detailed initial state: arms are available (`v4` and `v6`) with empty hands, a base configuration (`v3`), and objects with properties (graspable, stackable) and their initial poses and support relations.  Crucially, I have knowledge of grasps and kinematic information relating to how the robot can interact with the objects.  There are also *kin* facts that specify trajectories for picking up and placing.
           
           The available actions are limited, the only action instance I am given is to stay in place using the `move_base` action: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.
           
           **The Crucial Constraint: Action Instances**
           
           A significant constraint is that I can *only* use the provided action instances.  This is a critical point. The problem statement explicitly says that only the given action instances are allowed.
           
           My initial thought is to execute a plan using `pick` and `place` actions derived from the initial and the goal states. Based on the initial facts, I see `kin` facts relating to picking up and placing objects.  However, this requires the *presence* of instances like `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)` to be valid. The same goes for the other objects. The current scenario only gives a `move_base` action instance to stay in place.
           
           **The Impossibility of Solution**
           
           Unfortunately, I quickly realize the goal is unachievable with these constraints. To move the objects from `v11` to `v20`, I need to use `pick` and `place` actions. However, the *only* action I am allowed to use is a `move_base` action that does nothing except stay in place.  I have meticulously reviewed the problem, and there's no way to reach the desired `on` state without these actions.  Without pick and place actions, the `on` predicate cannot be changed.
           
           This is a classic case of an unsolvable planning problem due to restrictive action instances. The lack of `pick` and `place` makes the goal unattainable.
