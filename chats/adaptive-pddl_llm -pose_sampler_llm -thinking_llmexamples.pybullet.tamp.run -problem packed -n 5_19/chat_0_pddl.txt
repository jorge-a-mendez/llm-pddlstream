(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements**
           
           My task is to generate 50 stable placements for object ID 7 on surface 0. Object 7 has dimensions of approximately 0.0817 x 0.0817, making it almost square. Surface 0 is a square with side length 0.27, defined by the coordinates (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). A stable placement means the object, after rotation, is entirely within the surface's boundaries.
           
           I first considered how the object's effective dimensions change with rotation. The object is small enough that any orientation is feasible.  To ensure diversity, I decided to use two key orientations: 0 radians (no rotation) and pi/10 radians.
           
           For each orientation, I determined the valid range for the object's center (x, y) coordinates within the surface. I then created a 5x5 grid of evenly spaced (x, y) points within these valid ranges. This grid approach ensures 25 placements for each of the two chosen orientations, totaling 50 stable and distinct placements. The algorithm iterates through these calculations to generate the (surface, theta, x, y) values that represent a valid, stable set of placements.

(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Placing Object 4**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. I've been tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (Object 4) on a square surface (Surface 0).  The wrinkle?  I need to avoid collisions with another already placed object (Object 7).
           
           Here's my approach:
           
           1.  **Understand the Space:**  Surface 0 is a square, and I know the exact location and AABB of Object 7.  Object 4 is also a square, so its size and potential rotations directly influence its effective bounding box.
           
           2.  **Rotation is Key:**  Since Object 4 can be rotated, I have to consider the collision constraints and maximum dimensions for *each* angle.  I will be mainly working with two different rotation values.
           
           3.  **Forbidden Zone:** The existing object creates a "forbidden zone" within Surface 0.  I need to calculate this area. The center of Object 4 cannot enter that zone. If the object *center* is inside this zone, there is collision.
           
           4.  **Grid Approach:** I am going to use a grid-based approach (for two rotations). I will generate many points over the surface and then filter them by checking if the object, at that point, would collide with Object 7.
           
           5.  **Choose angles and Points:** I have to work around the limitations of the collision.
               For each angle, there would be a grid to choose the best points.
               I will generate a list of points and then remove the ones that are in collision.
               I will also make use of a set to ensure unique placement points.
           
           6.  **Edge Cases:** I need to handle rotations differently; with Object 4, it is easy due to its symmetry.
           
           7.  **Finalize & Iterate:** Once I have the final list of 50 non-colliding, stable placements. I have completed the task.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable positions for a new square object (ID 5) on surface 0, ensuring it doesn't collide with two existing objects (ID 7 and ID 4). Surface 0 is a square with side length 0.27, and object 5 is a square with sides of length 0.098283.  Object 7 is located at approximately (-0.094, -0.094) and Object 4 at (-0.086, -0.004).
           
           To plan this, I've calculated the minimum and maximum ranges on the surface for the center of the object, assuming rotations of 0 and π/4. Object 7 is in the bottom-left of the region, while object 4 lies above it to the right.
           
           The key to preventing collisions is a function that checks for the overlaps of the AABB bounding box for object 5 with existing objects.
           
           I'll use a grid-based approach with 7 gridpoints for both x and y.
           
           For each potential placement, I'll calculate the bounding box and then call the collision function.  I've found 64 placements (31 for 0 degrees and 33 for π/4) and then have selected the first 50.
