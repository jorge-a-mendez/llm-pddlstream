           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Impossibility of Goal Achievement**
           
           My analysis indicates that achieving the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently impossible due to a critical limitation in the available actions and the defined initial state. The plan requires the satisfaction of several predicates, but the only actions available to the rovers, `move`, are limited to staying in their initial configurations, `v13` and `v15`.
           
           The primary obstacle arises from the preconditions of key actions needed to achieve the goals of image and analysis acquisition. Both `take_image` and `calibrate` require the rovers to be at configurations defined by `#o3` (as per `imagevisible` predicates) and  `sample_rock` actions require `atconf` to match `#o5` as per `above` predicates. Similarly, to `send_analysis` or `send_image`, the rovers must be located at `#o0` (per `comvisible` predicates) as a precondition to any action.
           
           However, the action `move` actions available explicitly restrict the rovers to *only* moving between their current locations `v13` to `v13` or `v15` to `v15`, effectively preventing them from reaching the necessary configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, or `#o5`. This restriction renders the goal unreachable as the rovers cannot satisfy the necessary `atconf` preconditions for any action that generates a new `haveimage` or `analyzed` predicate. Since we can't `take_image`, the `receivedimage` predicates can't be achieved. Also, because we can't `sample_rock`, we can't fulfill the goals to send analysis.  Thus, given the provided initial state and action instances, the goals `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` cannot be achieved because the rovers are fixed at their initial configuration.
