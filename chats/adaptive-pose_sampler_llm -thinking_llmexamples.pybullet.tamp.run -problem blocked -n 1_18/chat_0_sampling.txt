           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to find 50 stable locations for this object (dimensions 0.07 x 0.07) on a surface defined by the bounds ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  A stable placement means the whole object fits inside the surface.
           
           First, I simplified things. Since the object is pretty close to a perfect square, I'm approximating it with a square side 's' of 0.07.  The key is that rotating this object changes the dimensions of its *bounding box* (the effective side length).  For a square, the biggest side length happens at 45 degree angles (s * sqrt(2) or about 0.099), the smallest at 0 and multiples of 90 degrees (s or 0.07). The surface area is much bigger than the object, giving me plenty of room.
           
           My plan is to spread out the object with different rotations. I'm choosing 5 angles: 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3*pi/4, and pi.  I'll then calculate the valid range for the center (x, y) coordinates for each angle, ensuring the object's bounding box stays within the surface. For theta=0, pi/2, pi, it's just 0.07/2 from each bound. For the others, it's 0.07 * sqrt(2)/2 or 0.0495.
           
           I'm dividing up the surface and placing 10 points at each angle. I'm varying x and y positions within the range. I picked the corners, the center, and edges.
           
           **Placements**
           
           *   **Theta 0 (0 degrees):** I set x range from 4.235 to 4.765 and y from -0.565 to -0.035 and then spaced the objects inside to find the placements.
           *   **Theta pi/4 (45 degrees):** I set x range from 4.2495 to 4.7505 and y from -0.5505 to -0.0495 and placed the objects inside the bounds.
           *   **Theta pi/2 (90 degrees):** I set x range from 4.235 to 4.765 and y from -0.565 to -0.035. I chose a different set of points within these ranges to make them distinct.
           *   **Theta 3*pi/4 (135 degrees):** I set x range from 4.2495 to 4.7505 and y from -0.5505 to -0.0495. I put the objects within the range.
           *   **Theta pi (180 degrees):** Same as the first.
           
           I have 50 placements in total. They cover all parts of the surface, with a variety of orientations. The dimensions and the math seem correct for stable placements of the object. They are ready to be used.

(Thoughts: **My Placement Strategy for Object 10 (ID: 10)**
           
           Alright, here's the plan. I've got to place this new object, ID 10, on Surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into Object 5 (ID: 5) which is already happily situated. Object 10 is almost a perfect square, so I'll be exploring different rotations to find the best spot.
           
           First, a quick recap of Object 5: it's at `(4.235, -0.565)` with a size of `0.07 x 0.07` and it's not rotated. I've already calculated its AABB, which is the region it occupies.
           
           Now, for Object 10. It's got dimensions of `0.0984040300988589 x 0.09840403009885845`. Very close to a square! I'll simplify those to roughly `0.0984`. Its starting location is free, and the surface bounds are known, defined as `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.
           
           To avoid collisions, I'll:
           
           1.  **Calculate Effective Dimensions:** Figure out how much space Object 10 takes up depending on its rotation (theta). Since it's nearly square, the effective dimensions won't change drastically with rotation, but I'll use the precise values for accuracy.
           2.  **Determine Valid Ranges:** Figure out the x and y ranges on Surface 0 that are valid for Object 10 at any given rotation.
           3.  **Generate Placements:** Systematically test a bunch of potential placements `(x_center, y_center, theta)`.
           4.  **Collision Check:** For each placement, calculate Object 10's AABB and check if it collides with Object 5's AABB. I will be checking against the calculated fixed AABB region of Object 5.
           5.  **Find 50 Unique Non-Colliding Placements:** The goal is to generate 50 distinct placements, making sure they are non-colliding with object 5 and within the surface bounds.
           
           The plan is to use a grid-like sampling approach with at least 8x8 points distributed throughout the surface to ensure diversity and systematically evaluate different rotations: `0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi` for a good mix. Since Object 10 is a square-like object, the valid AABB configurations occur at these rotation angles, which will also be used. This grid and rotation strategy will likely produce enough non-colliding candidates and then generate a list of exactly 50 suitable positions. If not, I'll have to adjust the grid density for better placement coverage.
