           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially means two rovers are at their initial configurations, two stores are free, all three objectives `v17, v18, v19` have received images with mode `v11`, and all rocks `v2` and `v6` have been analyzed.
           
           Let's break down the goal:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is true in the initial state.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is true in the initial state.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: This is true in the initial state.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: This is true in the initial state.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This needs to be achieved.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This needs to be achieved.
           7. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This needs to be achieved.
           8. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means all rocks of type `v2` need to be analyzed. From the initial state, `v3` and `v1` are type `v2` and `v4` is type `v2`. So `v3`, `v1`, and `v4` need to be analyzed.
           9. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means all rocks of type `v6` need to be analyzed. From the initial state, `v5`, `v8`, and `v7` are type `v6`. So `v5`, `v8`, and `v7` need to be analyzed.
           
           The available actions are very limited: only `move` and `drop_rock`.
           - `move` actions are given as `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`. These actions essentially move the rovers from their current configuration to the *same* configuration, which means they effectively do nothing to change the `atconf` predicates. Since the `atconf` predicates are already met, these are not directly useful for reaching the goal beyond satisfying the `atconf` parts.
           - `drop_rock` actions are `(drop_rock v12 v16)` and `(drop_rock v14 v16)`. These actions require `full(v, s)`. However, in the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true, and `full` is false for both. This means no rocks have been sampled by either rover, and thus cannot be dropped. Therefore, these actions are not useful for achieving the goal as we cannot get to a state where we can drop rocks.
           
           Let's look at how to achieve `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`:
           - To achieve `receivedimage(?o, ?m)`, we need to `send_image(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l, ?o, ?m)`. This requires `haveimage(?v, ?o, ?m)` and `comvisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l)`.
           - To achieve `haveimage(?v, ?o, ?m)`, we need to `take_image(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o, ?c, ?m)`. This requires `calibrated(?c, ?v)`, `onboard(?c, ?v)`, `supports(?c, ?m)`, `imagevisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o)`.
           - To achieve `calibrated(?c, ?v)`, we need to `calibrate(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o, ?c)`. This requires `onboard(?c, ?v)` and `imagevisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o)`.
           - To achieve `receivedanalysis(?r)`, we need to `send_analysis(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l, ?r)`. This requires `analyzed(?v, ?r)` and `comvisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l)`.
           - To achieve `analyzed(?v, ?r)`, we need to `sample_rock(?v, ?q, ?r, ?s)`. This requires `above(?v, ?q, ?r)` and `free(?v, ?s)`.
           
           The crucial issue is that none of the actions required to `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` are available in the provided list of valid action instances. The only available actions are `move` (which does not change the state relevant to the goal) and `drop_rock` (which cannot be executed due to missing preconditions).
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the given set of allowed actions.
