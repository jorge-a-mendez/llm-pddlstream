           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           I'm tasked with providing 50 stable placements for an object with ID 5, dimensions 0.07 x 0.07, on surface 0, defined by the coordinates ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  A "stable" placement means the object is fully contained within the surface boundaries, and I can rotate the object.
           
           Since the surface is a 0.6 x 0.6 square and the object is a much smaller square (0.07 x 0.07), there is ample space.  I want to create a diverse set of placements.
           
           First, I calculate the safe region for the object's center. To accommodate all rotations, I need to account for the object's maximum diagonal dimension, which occurs at a 45-degree angle (π/4 radians) rotation. This extended diagonal, using the AABB bounds is 0.07 * sqrt(2). So the *half* maximum dimension is 0.035 * sqrt(2) or approximately 0.0495. I then calculated bounds of the placement area: `x_lower_bound = 4.2 + 0.0495`,  `x_upper_bound = 4.8 - 0.0495`, `y_lower_bound = -0.6 + 0.0495`, `y_upper_bound = 0.0 - 0.0495`. These bounds give me a safe space to place the center (x, y) coordinates of the object, for *all* rotations.
           
           Next, I generated a 5x5 grid of (x, y) coordinates within this safe region, resulting in 25 distinct positions. This creates a diverse set of starting points. I then selected 2 different angles to add variety: 0 and pi/4.  This means that for each (x, y) position I'll place one object with no rotation, and then place another at the same location but with a rotation of 45 degrees. Therefore, a total of 50 stable object placements is created. Each placement specifies the surface, the angle, and the (x, y) coordinates, following the provided structure: `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`. The object's size and the surface characteristics ensure that these 50 placements are fully contained and therefore stable. The key here is the use of the bounding area for the center (x,y), which ensures that objects fit, no matter the rotation.
