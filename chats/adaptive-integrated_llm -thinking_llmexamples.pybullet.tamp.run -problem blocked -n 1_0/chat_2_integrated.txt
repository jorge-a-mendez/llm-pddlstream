User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.647, -0.361), (-4.57, -0.284)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.609, -0.322, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, 0.054).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which boils down to placing an object of type `v17` *on* surface `v18`. From the initial state, I know there are two objects of type `v17`: `v8` and `v12`. To get an object *on* something, I need the predicates `supported` and `atpose` to be true. Both `v8` and `v12` are *supported* by `#o2` on `v18` initially. Therefore, I need to place either `v8` or `v12` at pose `#o2`.
           
           My initial plan was to move `v8` from its current pose (`v9`) to `#o2` on `v18`. I've got the actions lined up: `move_base` to get the base in the right configuration and then a `pick` followed by a `place`. But now I'm hitting a roadblock because I need to find the appropriate continuous pose for `#o2`, ensuring stable placement according to the instructions.
           
           Now, here's where the problem arises. I have to make sure that the object is "fully contained within the bounds of the surface" to ensure stable placement. I'm using the provided AABB information to ensure this. The AABB for `v8` is `((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335))` and `v18` is `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.
           
           It's clear after analysis that the AABB values don't work. For `v8`, the y-coordinate ranges are entirely outside the range of `v18`. That is to say, if `v8` is indeed supported on `v18`, it can't be at those coordinates as I have them now. The same problem emerges with object `v12`, which also has a different AABB that cannot be placed inside `v18`.
           
           So, it seems that there's a geometric inconsistency. Neither `v8` nor `v12` can be stably placed on `v18` given their respective AABBs. Since the only objects with the necessary type (`v17`) are `v8` and `v12`, and I can't find a valid pose for them on `v18` due to the AABB constraints, I must conclude that `new-axiom@0()` is currently *unachievable* within the given constraints. The task demands finding a valid, stable, collision-free placement. This, unfortunately, appears impossible within the current problem setup, based on my analysis of the AABBs and the stable placement requirement.
