User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object

           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.647, -0.361), (-4.57, -0.284)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.609, -0.322, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, 0.054).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           Atom kin(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning Through Goal Unreachability**
           
           My goal is to find a plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which I've determined expands to `on(?green, v18) ∧ type(?green, v17)`. The objects `v8` and `v12` both satisfy the type constraint, so either could be `?green`.  Choosing `v8` for simplicity, the sub-goal is `on(v8, v18)`. From the axiom definition, achieving `on(v8, v18)` requires both `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)`. The initial state gives us `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`, so the real challenge is making `atpose(v8, #o2)` true.
           
           Currently, `v8` is `atpose(v8, v9)`.  To move it to `#o2`, I'd need a `pick` and a `place` action. However, the *only* available action instance is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  The prompt explicitly forbids using any action instance *not* in the provided list. Therefore, I can't move `v8` (or `v12`, the other valid option) because the necessary manipulation actions are unavailable.
           
           Since any object must be moved to be "on" `v18` and this requires unavailable actions, the goal is, unfortunately, unreachable given the restricted action set. The issue persists regardless of which eligible object I choose as `?green`.
