           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem requires achieving the `new-axiom@0()` state, which necessitates satisfying several conditions:
           1. Two rovers (`v12`, `v14`) must be at their respective `atconf` positions (`v13`, `v15`). This is already true in the initial state.
           2. Both rovers must have a free storage slot (`v16`). This is also true in the initial state.
           3. Two objectives (`v17`, `v18`) must have their images (`v11`) received.
           4. Two rocks of type `v2` (stone) and `v6` (soil) must have their analyses received.
           
           Let's break down how to achieve the image and analysis goals.
           
           **Image Reception:**
           To get `receivedimage(?o, ?m)`, we need to `send_image`. This requires `haveimage(?v, ?o, ?m)`, which is achieved by `take_image`. Taking an image requires the camera to be `calibrated`, which is done by `calibrate`. Both `take_image` and `calibrate` require `imagevisible` and `atconf`. `send_image` requires `comvisible` and `atconf`.
           
           Looking at the available action instances, we only have `move` and `drop_rock`. There are no `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` actions available.
           
           **Analysis Reception:**
           To get `receivedanalysis(?r)`, we need to `send_analysis`. This requires `analyzed(?v, ?r)`, which is achieved by `sample_rock`. `sample_rock` requires `above` and `atconf`. `send_analysis` requires `comvisible` and `atconf`.
           
           Again, the available action instances are limited to `move` and `drop_rock`.
           
           Since the problem requires that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is achieved, and the available actions do not include any actions that can create the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates (such as `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`, or `calibrate`), it is impossible to satisfy the goal from the initial state given the restricted set of executable actions. The only actions provided are `move` and `drop_rock`, none of which contribute to the generation of `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the given set of allowed action instances.
