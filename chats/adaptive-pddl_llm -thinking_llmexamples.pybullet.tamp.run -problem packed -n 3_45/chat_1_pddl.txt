           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable with Available Actions**
           
           Okay, so I'm looking at this problem, and my goal is pretty clear: I need to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all *on* `v16`. That means, in terms of my plan, I need `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`. Breaking it down, each of these `on` goals requires two conditions: that the object is supported by `v16` and that the object is in a specific pose, `?p`.
           
           Analyzing the initial state, I see that these objects are *currently* supported by and *atpose* `v11`, not `v16`. Specifically: `v8` is at `v9`, `v12` is at `v13`, and `v14` is at `v15`. To get them to where they need to be, I'll need to move them.
           
           My available actions, however, are extremely limited. I'm given only one: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This action is completely useless for achieving the `on` predicates, as it simply "moves the base" from `v3` to `v3` which is essentially no move and doesn't change any of the object's relationships or poses. My goal requires `pick` and `place` actions because I need to alter the objects' states.
           
           Now, let's consider the requirements for `pick` and `place` actions, even though they aren't available to me. They rely on things like `atpose`, `supported`, `kin`, `graspable` predicates. I *do* have some information that could be useful: I know `arm(v4)`, `handempty(v4)`, `atbconf(v3)`, `graspable(v8)`, `graspable(v12)`, and `graspable(v14)`. I also know the grasp and kinematic states, and this includes information about `?o2` which is the destination pose I need. But, this isn't enough.
           
           The problem specifically says I'm *only* allowed to use the given action. The list I'm given does not contain the necessary actions `pick` and `place`. It's clear that with the severely limited action space I'm in, this goal state is **unreachable**. I simply don't have the tools I need to manipulate the objects and achieve `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`. It's a no-go.
