User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object

           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.233, 0.088, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.043, 0.999).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.24, -0.054, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.516, 0.857).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.076, 0.278), (0.018, 0.372)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.174, -0.355), (-0.089, -0.271)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.168, -0.246), (0.243, -0.171)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.271, 0.05), (-0.195, 0.126)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.029, 0.325, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.232, 0.973).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.193, -0.101), (0.288, -0.007)).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.131, -0.313, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.993, 0.118).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.205, -0.209, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.731, 0.682).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning the Object Relocation Task**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) from their initial positions on table v11 to a smaller object, v20. The robot is stationary at base v3, and I've got two arms, v4 and v6. Both are handempty.
           
           The core idea is to *pick* each object from v11 and *place* it onto v20. It's a straightforward sequence of pick-and-place actions. The `move_base` action isn't strictly necessary as the robot's base isn't moving. The key is finding appropriate, non-overlapping target poses on v20 and ensuring these poses are collision-free.
           
           I've got the following initial state facts that need to be considered:
           1.  All five objects can be grasped.
           2.  v20 is a small surface, so I must arrange these objects very precisely.
           3.  Some objects, v8, v14, v16, and v18, have poses on v20 specified in the initial state using a shared variable, #o2. To avoid collisions, each of those gets a *different continuous value*. I'll put these at (-0.06, 0.06, 0.781, 0), (-0.06, -0.06, 0.781, 0), (0.06, -0.06, 0.781, 0), and (0, 0, 0.781, 0).
           4.  v12 does *not* have a valid supporting fact already existing in the initial state, so I'll create a new pose variable, `#p_v12_on_v20` to satisfy the place goal.
           
           I need to make sure I'm following the rules about providing poses and their values. The only poses I'm going to provide are those which are specified in the initial state already and which need values assigned.
           
           For the arm trajectory, I will create `#o3`, `#o4` as the first trajectory variables, but will increment them for each new pick and place action (to `#o5`, `#o6` etc.)
           
           Here are the poses that I will provide:
           -   (#o2 v8 v20): (-0.06 0.06 0.781 0.0)
           -   (#o2 v14 v20): (-0.06 -0.06 0.781 0.0)
           -   (#o2 v16 v20): (0.06 -0.06 0.781 0.0)
           -   (#o2 v18 v20): (0.0 0.0 0.781 0.0)
           
           So in short, I'll generate a sequence of 10 pick and place steps, one for each object. Total cost = 10.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o3) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o5) , (place v4 v12 #p_v12_on_v20 #o1 v3 #o6) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o7) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o8) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o9) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o10) , (pick v4 v18 v19 #o1 v3 #o11) , (place v4 v18 #o2 #o1 v3 #o12)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Unattainable Goal**
           
           Okay, I see the problem. The user is right; my initial plan was invalid because I strayed from the permissible actions. I was given a list of *allowed* action instances, and I clearly didn't stick to them. It's frustrating, but it's back to the drawing board.
           
           The only action instance I'm allowed to use is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  That's a base movement from `v3` to `v3` using trajectory `#o0`.  Essentially, it's a useless move for this task as it just keeps the robot in the same base configuration and doesn't affect the objects in any way. It only touches the `canmove()` predicate.
           
           The goal is to get several objects – specifically `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` – onto the surface `v20`.  That implies getting them to a `supported` state on `v20`.  My knowledge of action schemas tells me I need to find some way to generate `on(object, v20)` for each of those objects.
           
           The problem? I'm only allowed the `move_base` action. I have *no* `pick`, *no* `place`, *no* `clean`, and *no* `cook` actions available.  Without those crucial actions, I simply cannot manipulate objects. I can't *pick* up `v8` from its current position on `v11` and then *place* it on `v20`.
           
           The initial state, as the user pointed out, indicates the objects are *supported* and *atpose* on `v11`. To achieve my goal, I'd need to change `supported(v8, v9, v11)` and `atpose(v8, v9)` to `supported(v8, pose, v20)` and `atpose(v8, pose)`. This requires the application of place actions, of which I have none.
           
           Therefore, given the constraints of only using `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, the provided goal is currently *unreachable*. It's a logistical dead end.
