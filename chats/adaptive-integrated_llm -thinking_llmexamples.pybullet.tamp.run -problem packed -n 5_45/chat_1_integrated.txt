           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.233, 0.088, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.043, 0.999).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.24, -0.054, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.516, 0.857).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.076, 0.278), (0.018, 0.372)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.174, -0.355), (-0.089, -0.271)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.168, -0.246), (0.243, -0.171)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.271, 0.05), (-0.195, 0.126)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.029, 0.325, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.232, 0.973).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.193, -0.101), (0.288, -0.007)).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.131, -0.313, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.993, 0.118).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.205, -0.209, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.731, 0.682).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. My objective is to get these five objects – v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18 – all *on* object v20. The key here is the *on* predicate, which hinges on *supported* and *atpose*. Essentially, I need to figure out a suitable pose for each object on v20 where they'll be supported and then get the robot to place them there.
           
           Currently, all the objects are stacked on v11 at distinct poses (v9, v13, v15, v17, v19 respectively), and I have the knowledge in the form of `kin` facts related to arm v4 with a common grasp `#o1`, base configuration `#o3`, and an arm trajectory `#o4`. I also know that the robot's base configuration is currently v3. Importantly, there's no movement allowed from that point.
           
           Given the existing facts and constraints, here's how I'll proceed:
           
           1.  **Iterative Pick and Place:** I'll use a straightforward pick-and-place strategy. I'll pick each object up from its initial pose on v11 and place it on v20, one at a time.
           2.  **Unique Placement:** Here's the critical bit: since I have to place all of these objects on the same surface, v20, I have to compute distinct positions, within the AABB of v20, for each of them. Specifically, I will choose x,y coordinates and keep the z-coordinate at 0.781.
           3.  **Action Sequence:**
               *   Pick v8 from v9 using arm v4.
               *   Place v8 on v20 at a specific pose (#o2 for v8)
               *   Pick v12 from v13 using arm v4.
               *   Place v12 on v20 at a specific pose (#o2 for v12)
               *   Pick v14 from v15 using arm v4.
               *   Place v14 on v20 at a specific pose (#o2 for v14)
               *   Pick v16 from v17 using arm v4.
               *   Place v16 on v20 at a specific pose (#o2 for v16)
               *   Pick v18 from v19 using arm v4.
               *   Place v18 on v20 at a specific pose (#o2 for v18)
           
           Each of these steps will be executed sequentially to ensure each object ends up *on* v20.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v18 v19 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v18 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Implausibility of the Current Plan**
           
           Okay, so I messed up. The user pointed out that my previous plan included actions that weren't in the allowed set. My focus was too broad, I should have paid closer attention to the constraints. Specifically, the only allowed action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This moves the robot's base, which is not particularly helpful in placing objects.
           
           Looking at the goal, I need to place objects on `v20`: `on(v8, v20)`, `on(v12, v20)`, `on(v14, v20)`, `on(v16, v20)`, and `on(v18, v20)`. That's the core of the challenge. I need to get each object grasped and then placed on `v20`.  Naturally, that involves *pick* and *place* actions.  
           
           The problem? *Pick* and *place* are not in the allowed action instances. With the permitted action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, I can't manipulate objects. I'm essentially stuck.  Therefore, I'm going to have to state the obvious: the goal is currently unachievable, given the constraints.
