(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for a Square Object on a Square Surface**
           
           I've been tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a small square object (ID 6, side length roughly 0.095) on a larger square surface (centered at (0,0) and side length 0.270). A stable placement means the object's bounding box is fully contained within the surface's bounding box. The placements are described by (surface index, rotation angle, x-coordinate, y-coordinate).
           
           To ensure stability, I needed to figure out how the object's effective size changes with rotation.  Since it's a square, the effective dimensions of its bounding box are influenced by `abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))`. When the rotation is 0 or multiples of π/2, the effective size is just the object's side length.  When rotated by π/4, the effective size increases to the side length multiplied by the square root of 2.
           
           I calculated the maximum allowable x and y offsets for a given angle to ensure containment. This is found by subtracting half of the effective dimension from half the surface's side length (0.135).  Therefore, I generated a list of angles covering the range from 0 to π/2 to cover the possible range of rotations.
           
           To achieve diversity, I've selected a variety of angles. I've chosen these angles: 0, π/12, π/6, π/4, π/3, 5π/12 and π/2.  I then calculated the maximum x and y for each angle and created a distribution of positions within these maximum values, targeting ~7 positions for each of the 7 angles plus a single additional center-placed item for a total of 50. I've designed grids, using the x and y values that are a function of the respective angle of rotation, to ensure these placements are unique and fill the space effectively.  The values are mathematically determined to maximize the distance between the center point (0, 0), the mid-axis points of rotation and the corners.

(Thoughts: **Analysis and Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback that object ID 6 was successfully placed. Now, I need to figure out where to put object ID 4 on the same surface, surface 0, while avoiding a collision with the already-placed object 6. I'm given the dimensions for both objects, the surface boundaries, and the position of object 6.  I need to find 50 stable placements.
           
           The key challenge here is that object 6 is already at the origin, with a rotation of zero, and it's a bit larger than I realized, so any placement of object 4 will have to avoid that area. Since object 4 is also square, I have some flexibility with its orientation, but not enough to guarantee a solution for all angles.
           
           First, I need to consider all angles. I initially had the plan to find at least 50 possible placement locations (x, y) with various angles, but I am going to limit the values. The main challenge comes when considering rotations where the effective AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of object 4 *will* intersect with the AABB of object 6, no matter the specific (x, y) location on the surface. Specifically, angles are to be placed, but due to object dimensions, that causes issues with non-overlapping constraints. 
           
           So, I had to completely re-evaluate my placement strategy, because no amount of shifting object 4's (x, y) would make the objects not overlap. I've concluded that it is only possible to place the object without any collision only when its rotation is zero.
           
           Then I needed to consider a set of positions on surface bounds that is far enough from object 6's position so that objects don't touch each other.
           
           To avoid collision, I need to have a set of coordinates where object 4 is on the outer boundaries. Since `y` can be zero, I can assume it should be fine. I'll utilize a few sets of coordinates where the center is not in collision zones, so that an (x, y) point doesn't create a collision. 
           
           The strategy now is clear: I'm focusing solely on placements where the object's orientation is such that it can clear the occupied region of object 6. After this, I am making sure the placed object does not cause any overlap. After this I'll iterate and consider valid placements. After that, I will combine the appropriate coordinates and finally produce 50 placement possibilities.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 7 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing 50 stable instances of object 7 (a square, size `s_7 = 0.07768034722739894`) on surface 0, while carefully avoiding collisions with two previously placed objects: object 6 (square, center at `(0, 0)`) and object 4 (square, center at approximately `(0.0866, 0.0866)`).
           
           To ensure stability, I've got to keep the center of object 7 within the surface bounds, which is defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  A key consideration here is that the effective size of the square object changes based on its rotation, and my analysis shows that for practical placement, I'll be restricting myself to `theta = 0` (or `pi/2` which is effectively the same for the square's geometry). This greatly simplifies the collision detection process.
           
           My main focus now is collision avoidance. To avoid overlapping, I must keep object 7's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) from intersecting with the AABB's of objects 6 and 4.  I've calculated the key dimensions and ranges involved, focusing on the distances from the center of object 7 to avoid the established boxes:
           
           *   **Object 6:** To avoid collision, object 7's center needs to be at least `0.0862766229` away from the origin along either the X or Y axis.
           *   **Object 4:** To avoid overlap, object 7's center can't be between about `0.00859627563` to approximately 0.16.
           
           This information defines my safe zones and unsafe "strips" on the plane. I need to make the center either greater than or equal to `0.0862766229` in absolute value, or to have its x and y coordinates both be equal to or less than `0.00859627563` (since the other collision zone is beyond the plane).
           
           I've carefully planned several sets of potential placements, making sure that there will be 50 positions to work from. To create these spots, I'll use the negative part of the plane, and part of the positive side:
           
           1.  Places to have the x component of object 7's center in the area to the left of the origin: `[-0.09615982638, -0.091, -0.0862766229]` with different y components.
           2.  Places to have the y component of object 7's center in the area below the origin: `[-0.09615982638, -0.091, -0.0862766229]` with different x components.
           3.  Places in the plane where we can add object 7.
           
           With this strategy, I should be able to create 50 stable and collision-free placement spots for object 7.
