               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Plan**
           
           My primary objective is to achieve the goal state where `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are all supported by `v16` and at their designated poses, `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  Currently, these objects are supported by `v11` at various poses: `on(v8, v11)`, `on(v12, v11)`, and `on(v14, v11)`.  To achieve the goal, I need to manipulate the `atpose` of each object, specifically moving them all to the pose `#o2` supported by `v16`.
           
           To move each object, the standard approach would involve a sequence of `pick` and `place` actions. For instance, to move `v8`, I would need to:
           1.  `pick` `v8` from its current pose `v9`.
           2.  `place` `v8` at the target pose `#o2`.
           
           The preconditions for `pick` and `place` are all met with the given facts and assumptions: hand is empty, object can be grasped, appropriate poses are available, no unsafe conditions.  The robot has an arm (`v4`) which is currently empty.
           
           However, a critical constraint arises.  The only allowed action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This severely limits my options, as the goal necessitates changes to the `atpose` predicate of the objects. Since `move_base` doesn't alter `atpose` or `on`, I am effectively blocked from modifying the state as required to satisfy the goal.  I cannot use `pick` and `place` because they are explicitly excluded.  Therefore, I conclude that the goal state is unreachable with the given constraints.
