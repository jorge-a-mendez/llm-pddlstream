           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Goal Unreachability**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: getting `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all `on` `v16`.  This translates to needing to have those three objects supported by `v16` *and* at the correct poses relative to `v16`.  I know the `on` predicate is satisfied if `supported` and `atpose` conditions are met.  From the initial state, I can see that all three objects are already *potentially* supported by `v16` (specifically at pose `#o2`).
           
           The problem lies with the poses. Initially, I have `v8` at `v9`, `v12` at `v13`, and `v14` at `v15`.  To achieve the goal, they *need* to be at pose `#o2`.  This calls for a change in the `atpose` facts.
           
           I immediately consider the necessary actions: `pick` and `place`.  I'd have to `pick` each object from its initial pose and then `place` it at `#o2`.
           
           However, here's the critical constraint: I'm only allowed to use the action instances *provided*.  I carefully examined the provided list, and the only action instance is a `move_base` action.  No `pick` or `place` actions are available.
           
           Since I can't modify the `atpose` facts directly without `pick` and `place`, and those actions are not provided, it's immediately clear: the goal is unreachable.  I've double-checked my understanding of the `on` axiom and the implications, and my conclusion is firm.  The robot is simply not equipped to manipulate the objects as required.
