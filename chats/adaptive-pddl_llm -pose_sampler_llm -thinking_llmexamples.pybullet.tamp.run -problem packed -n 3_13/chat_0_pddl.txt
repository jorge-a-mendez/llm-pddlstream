(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object 4 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so the challenge is to come up with 50 stable placements for an object (ID 4) of specific dimensions (roughly a square, 0.074 units on a side) on a square surface (centered at 0,0, side length 0.27).  My main approach will focus on ensuring the object's bounding box stays entirely within the surface's boundaries, regardless of its rotation.
           
           First, I need to understand the constraints. With the object's dimensions and the surface's size, I know how far the center of the object can be from each edge while it still stays inside the surface, which is based on the widest or longest rotated dimensions that may impact clearance. The surface limits are clear, giving me an initial AABB size relative to the rotated bounding boxes. The object's "effective" size changes with rotation.  If the object is unrotated, then it's clear what can be the limits of center positions. Rotating the object changes the maximum extent of the bounding box. After some thought, I realize I need to consider the worst-case scenario: rotation at 45 degrees, where the rotated AABB is biggest.
           
           Since I'm dealing with a square object, the maximum effective bounding box size will occur at 45-degree rotations. To maximize the coverage of placement, I'll then limit the placement of the center. 
           
           I'll generate a grid of x and y coordinates, but within the bounds of the surface.  Since I know that the 45-degree rotation is the most restrictive, I'll use that calculation to constrain the placement space.
           
           For each valid coordinate, I will apply rotation: 0 and 45 degrees (pi/4).
           
           The structure will be a list of these placements with the format (surface_index, theta, x, y).  The core logic is to generate a grid for each direction, combined with rotations.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement and Collision Avoidance**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback that a previous placement was successful. Now, I need to place a new square object (ID 5) on surface 0, avoiding collisions with a previously placed square object (ID 4) that's currently at (-0.08, -0.08). The dimensions of the new object are approximately 0.0785 units by 0.0785 units. Let's call its side length S5.
           
           I'll start by determining the region occupied by object 4. Its center is at (-0.08, -0.08), and its half-size, based on S4, is about 0.037. This means object 4 occupies the region approximately between (-0.117, -0.117) and (-0.043, -0.043).
           
           The surface on which I need to place the new object is defined by coordinates between (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135).  I'll now focus on finding 50 stable placements for the new object, ensuring no collision with the current object.
           
           To account for rotation, I'll calculate the *effective* half-size of object 5, which varies with the angle of rotation (theta). The general formula for the effective half-size is `S5_half * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This formula reaches a minimum at rotations of 0 or pi/2, and a maximum at pi/4. I'll need to consider this.  The new object's half-size is about 0.0393.  Maximum effective half-size, at pi/4, is about 0.0555 units.
           
           To ensure stability and collision avoidance, I will need to consider all angles: 0, pi/4, pi/2 and 3*pi/4, and make sure that any AABB created from rotation and offset is not colliding with the space occupied by the previous object. So, I must ensure that these conditions are met. These rules will determine the placement to avoid collision: `x >= 0.01273` OR `y >= 0.01273`. So, any placement in the bottom-left quadrant `x < 0.01273` and `y < 0.01273` will likely cause a collision.
           
           I've generated a grid of possible center points for the new object and checked for collisions at different rotations (0, pi/4, pi/2, 3*pi/4). I need to ensure that the new object's AABB doesn't overlap object 4's AABB.  By considering a grid of x and y values for the center points and iterating over all rotations, I will be able to verify this condition.
           
           After evaluating each potential center point and rotation, I've identified 90 unique stable placements, far more than the requested 50, but it will work.

(Thoughts: **My Process for Finding Stable Placements**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find 50 stable and collision-free locations for a new, square object (ID 6) on surface 0. I've got to avoid bumping into two other objects already on the surface: object 4 and object 5.
           
           First, I've got the lay of the land. Surface 0 is a rectangle, from `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.  Object 4 is a small square centered at `(-0.08, -0.08)`, and object 5 is slightly bigger and centered at `(-0.07, -0.03)`. I've calculated their axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) to help with collision detection.
           
           Now, for object 6, it's also a square, with a side length of 0.097339... I need to consider its AABB, which will change depending on its rotation (theta). A rotation of 0 means the AABB is a straightforward rectangle aligned with the axes. But, if I rotate it, the AABB becomes larger. I've calculated the effective half-size of the AABB as a function of the rotation angle using a simple formula: `S6_half * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This means to avoid objects the maximum size will be at 45 degrees.
           
           The surface boundaries limit where I can place this object. It has to fit within the surface's rectangle, considering that it could be rotated. The surface bounds are [-0.135, 0.135] in the x and y directions. So, the max x, y distance for a center is the half-size of the surface - effective_halfsize of my object.  I've reasoned out that with the max rotation (45 deg) I need to make the x and y center coordinate magnitudes less than  `0.0661679509809466`.  This is helpful for my grid strategy.
           
           To find stable positions, I'll test a few rotations (0 and 45 degrees) and test against an evenly-spaced grid. I calculate AABBs to ensure there is no overlap in the X or Y coordinates. I will do this by setting up a grid for potential center locations, and testing each (x, y) coordinate pair at angles 0, 45, 90, 135. After, I check each coordinate with the two AABBs.
           
           The first strategy is:
             1.  x_coords = [-0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06]
             2.  y_coords = [-0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06]
             3.  thetas_extended = [0.0, math.pi/4, math.pi/2, 3*math.pi/4]
           
           This creates a 5x5 grid with 4 potential theta rotations.  If a placement is collision-free, it's marked valid.  Otherwise, it's discarded.  I have 100 placements to check. I then pull the first 50 valid ones.
