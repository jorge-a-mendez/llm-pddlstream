(Thoughts: **Reasoning through the Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get an object, let's call it `?green`, onto `v18` and ensure it's of a certain `type` (specifically, `v17`).  I can see that `v12` fits the bill for `?green` because `type(v12, v17)` is already true, and I know I can stack `v12` on `v18`. So, my immediate focus is on getting `v12` to a state where it's `on(v18)`.
           
           Since `on(x,y)` means "supported on", and requires both `supported(x, p, y)` and `atpose(x, p)`, I need to figure out how to satisfy those.  I have `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` from the initial state, meaning `v12` can be supported by `v18` at a pose `#o2`.  Thus, the main hurdle becomes getting `v12` *at* the pose `#o2`.
           
           `v12` currently is at pose `v13`.  Looking at the available actions, I see a "pick" action, which means to pick `v12` from its current pose, and a "place" action, which does just that, place the object at the target pose.  The pick action requires an initial base configuration matching the final one for the place.
           
           Now, before I can pick up `v12`, I need to adjust the base configuration because I need `#o3`, where `#o3` represents the final pose required to properly carry out the place action.
           I can use `move_base` action to move the base configuration from the current one to `#o3`.
           
           Then, I can use the pick action to grab `v12` from its initial pose. I will move the base configuration to `#o3`,  using the trajectory `#o4`, arm `v4`, and grasping `#o1`.
           Since the initial state doesn't list any negative constraints, the plan proceeds assuming that all 'unsafe' predicates are false (like `unsafeapproach` and `unsafeatraj`).
           
           After picking, I can use the "place" action to set `v12` at pose `#o2` on `v18`. Again, the arm is `v4`, and grasp is `#o1`.
           
           In summary, my plan is:
           
           1.  **`move_base`**: Move to the required base configuration (`v3` to `#o3`).
           2.  **`pick`**: Pick up `v12` from its current pose, using `v4`, `#o1`, and `#o4`.
           3.  **`place`**: Place `v12` at pose `#o2` on `v18`, using `v4`, `#o1`, and `#o4`.
           
           I've carefully considered the preconditions for each action, and it appears this plan will achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, given the assumptions I've made about the unstated constraints. The initial goal is fulfilled as the object `v12` ends on `v18`.
