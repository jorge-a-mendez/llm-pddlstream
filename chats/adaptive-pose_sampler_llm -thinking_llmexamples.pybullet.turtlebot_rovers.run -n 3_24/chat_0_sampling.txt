(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment & Strategy for Robot Base Placement**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out where to place three robot bases near a specified `target_point`, making sure they're within a `max_range` of 2 units. The robot's orientation (`theta`) will automatically adjust to face the target. Crucially, I've got to avoid collisions with fixed obstacles and ensure the line-of-sight (LOS) to the target is clear. The robot's (x, y) coordinates must be within the bounds of [-2.5, 2.5] for both x and y.
           
           I'm given the locations of fixed obstacles as Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs). My first job is to parse these AABBs and understand their layout. It's a bit of a spatial reasoning puzzle.
           
           **Understanding the Obstacle Landscape**
           
           I've examined the AABBs: I've identified the "floor" and walls of the room. I also see a long, thin vertical wall right down the middle at x=0. This central wall immediately jumped out as a key obstruction. There are other smaller obstacles scattered around the room: squares and rectangular blocks, which create more complexity to avoid.

(Thoughts: **My Current Analysis and Proposed Positions**
           
           Okay, here's the deal. I've been given some feedback, and it's thrown me for a bit of a loop. The target point I'm working with now (`(-0.37, 2.15)`) seems to be different from what I started with, and the feedback clearly indicates the geometry is a lot trickier than it initially seemed. Basically, it's telling me my old positions weren't going to cut it.
           
           The crux of the problem is this target point. It's *inside* an obstacle (Obstacle 10, to be precise), which, according to my understanding of how this works, means it's pretty much impossible to have a clear line of sight. Any straight line from a robot base to that target point has to go *through* that obstacle, which blocks the view.
           
           The prompt, though, says I *must* find three positions. So, I need to come up with something, even if it feels like I'm grasping at straws. The usual constraints still apply. The base needs to be within 2 meters of the target, and it needs to be in a certain x-y area (`x: [-2.5, 2.5]`, `y: [-2.5, 2.5]`). I also know I need to stay to the left of the central wall.
           
           Given this, I have to assume a few things, perhaps this implies the target is the center of a physical object, and the robot might be able to detect the edge of the object, not only the center point.
           
           Therefore, I'm going to propose these three positions. I have taken these positions from the obstacle's borders so that my hope is that it has a possibility of LOS to the target object:
           
           1.  **P1 = (-0.2, 1.6)** (Right-Below): Positioned at a x-position that it is to the right of the wall and lower in y coordinate.
           2.  **P2 = (-0.2, 2.3)** (Right-Above): Positioned at a x-position that it is to the right of the wall and higher in y coordinate.
           3.  **P3 = (-0.8, 1.6)** (Left-Below): Positioned at a x-position that is to the left of the obstacle's borders and lower in y coordinate.
           
           I have placed these points so that I can provide an answer. But, I must say that based on my calculations, the target location being *inside* an obstacle makes true line-of-sight a real challenge. I am choosing the closest ones to the edges, assuming there is a tolerance or a slight "viewing angle" that my simple analysis might be missing. Given the constraints and the feedback, I have done the best I can with the information.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis and Proposed Solution**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. The feedback I'm getting is a bit convoluted. It seems the environment is re-using positions I generated for a *previous* target point (`T_prev = (-0.37, 2.16)`) but applying them to a *new* target point (`T_current = (1.89, 1.82)`). This is a bit misleading, but I need to make the best of it.
           
           The earlier feedback focused on why my proposed positions for the *previous* target failed. Those failures were largely due to those positions being on the *wrong* side of the central wall (`x<0`) and thus blocked from the *current* target's perspective (it's on the right side).
           
           Now, the *current* target point,  `T = (1.89, 1.82)`, is located within a solid rectangular obstacle (Obstacle 7), specifically at coordinates `((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25))`.  This implies I need to find positions *around* this obstacle, not directly *inside* it, to allow for a potential LOS to the target.
           
           Given this context and the target's location, I'm proposing the following three positions, strategically chosen to give a good view:
           
           1.  **(1.89, 1.0):** This position is directly below the target point, and well below the y-range of Obstacle 7. This allows us to avoid the obstacle and ensure the 'x' coordinate is within bounds.
           2.  **(2.3, 1.82):**  This position will be on the outer boundary of obstacle 7 by adding a small offset to ensure it's outside. This position's coordinates are `x = 2.3` and `y = 1.82`.
           3.  **(1.0, 1.82):** This position will be located directly to the left of the target and to the right of the central wall, at `x=1.0` and `y=1.82`.
           
           All these proposed positions adhere to the system's room limitations, target's 'x' coordinate requirement, and are well within the maximum distance range. These choices are made with the intent to avoid the obstacle containing the target while maintaining a clear potential LOS, or a direct line of sight.
