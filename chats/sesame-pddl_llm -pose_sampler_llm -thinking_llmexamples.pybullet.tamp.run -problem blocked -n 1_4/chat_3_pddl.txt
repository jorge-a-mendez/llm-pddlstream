(Thoughts: **The Path to `new-axiom@0()` in PR2-TAMP**
           
           My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a specific type placed *on* another object.  Analyzing the initial state, I see I need to get `v12` (an object of type `v17`) `on` `v18`. Luckily, I have initial facts stating that  `v12` is stackable on `v18` and supported there at a particular pose, which I'll call `#o2`.  So, I need to make sure `v12` is at pose `#o2`.  Currently, it's at `v13` and also supported by `v14`.  I need to get it from `v13` to `#o2`.
           
           The available actions are `pick` and `place`. `v12` is currently supported at `v13`. It makes sense to pick it up and then place it at the desired location. Therefore, my plan is to:
           
           1.  **Move the base**: First, I see that I need to reposition the base to support the arm's motion. The plan calls for `move_base` to get to base configuration `#o3` which has the right arm trajectory.
           2.  **Pick up the object:** Then, I can pick `v12` from its current pose `v13`.
           3.  **Place the object:** Finally, I can place it at `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           I have all the kinematics information (`kin`) for both picking and placing, and all grasp and pose information needed.
           
           I see that `canmove()` must be true.  Also, to pick the object, the base must be at a specific base configuration, but currently the base is at `v3`. That means I must first move the base to the configuration `#o3` which allows the `pick` action to be performed. This requires a `move_base()` action. After which I can proceed with the pick and place.
           
           After the `move_base()` action has been completed, I can pick up and place the object to satisfy the preconditions of `pick` and `place` appropriately. This will allow the plan to be executed to completion and satisfy the requirements.
           
           Final Plan:
           
           1. `move_base(v3, #o3, #o0)`
           2. `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           3. `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           
           I am now confident that this plan will successfully achieve my goal.
