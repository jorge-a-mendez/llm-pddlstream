           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Problem and Discovering an Impossibility**
           
           Okay, here's the situation: I need to get these four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) onto v18, placing them at specific poses.  Easy enough, right?  They're all currently on v11, and the robot has two arms, with the `v4` arm being the only one that can actually manipulate things based on the available information. The goal state boils down to: "get everything on v18."
           
           My initial thought process is to pick up each object from v11 using `v4` and place it on v18. The available `kin` facts indicate this is possible, with known base configurations and grasp poses. I know that `v4` is the working arm for this task.
           
           However, things start to fall apart when I dig deeper into the prerequisites for the `pick` and `place` actions.  Each object needs to be picked from its current pose and placed.
           
           Crucially, the `pick` action has a precondition: `atbconf(?q)`, where `?q` is the base configuration from the `kin` facts. All my `kin` facts require `atbconf(#o3)`. But here's the rub: I *only* have an action for `move_base v3 v3 #o0` and the initial state has `atbconf(v3)` as true.  This `move_base` action doesn't change `atbconf` facts at all. If it does anything, it keeps the `atbconf(v3)` fact true, and in all cases does *not* move to `#o3`.
           
           So, the robot can't reach the required base configuration `#o3`.  All the `pick` and `place` actions depend on this. So, since the `pick` action cannot be executed, I cannot move objects from their current poses to their goal poses.
           
           Since there's no way to get the base configuration to `#o3` with the provided actions, and since `pick` and `place` depend on being at `#o3`, the goal simply can't be achieved. The solution is *unreachable*.
