           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Revised Plan: Achieving `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` Domain**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with crafting a plan to satisfy the conditions of this new axiom. It boils down to ensuring all images and analyses are received, and the rovers and their stores are back in their initial states. Here's my breakdown:
           
           **Understanding the Goal:** The `new-axiom@0()` goal requires us to get images of three specific "objectives" and perform analysis on a stone and a soil sample, while ensuring that Rover `v12` is back in its initial configuration at `v13`, Rover `v14` is back at `v15`, and the storage locations for both rovers are free.
           
           **My Approach:** I'm splitting this into two main parts: image acquisition/transmission and sample collection/analysis. I'll utilize two rovers to expedite things. Rover `v12` will handle all image-related tasks and the stone analysis, while Rover `v14` takes on the soil analysis.
           
           **Rover `v12` (Image and Stone):**
           1.  **Image Acquisition:** I'll begin by moving `v12` to a designated "imaging" configuration (`#o3`).  From there, I'll calibrate `v12`'s onboard camera (`v10`) against each objective, take the images, and then move `v12` to a "communication" configuration (`#o0`).
           2.  **Image Transmission:** Once in the comms config, I'll transmit the images to the lander (`v9`).
           3.  **Stone Analysis:** Then, Rover v12 needs to move to sample and analyse the stone. Finally, return to the comms config, send the analysis to v9, and then reset back to its initial config (`v13`).
           
           **Rover `v14` (Soil):**
           *   **Sample & Analysis:**  Rover v14 will be deployed to go to the sampling location `#o5`, collect and analyse the sample, then send the analysis to the lander `v9`. After sending the results, it should discard the sample and go back to its initial config (`v15`).
           
           **Configuration Points:** Now comes the critical part—defining these "continuous" configuration points. I'm focusing on two:
           
           *   **`#o0` (Communication):**  The communication configuration has been assigned coordinates `(-1.5, -1.0)`. This point is reachable by both rovers, outside of known AABBs, and facilitates clear communication with the lander. The requirement of `comrange` predicates being true ensures that this also fulfills the range requirements for communication.
           *   **`#o3` (Imaging):** The imaging configuration has been assigned `(0.0, 1.0)` coordinates.  This location is chosen because the `imagerange` predicates are already true for each objective and since the objects are in a small range, this helps. This helps make the plan simpler. It is also collision free.
           *   `#o5` (Sample): I did not use coordinates for this configuration due to the lack of constraints.
           
           I've ensured to specify the continuous values using the syntax: `(#o0 v12 #o1 v9): (-1.5 -1.0)`, `(#o0 v14 #o1 v9): (-1.5 -1.0)`, `(#o3 v12 #o4 v17): (0.0 1.0)`, `(#o3 v12 #o4 v18): (0.0 1.0)`, `(#o3 v12 #o4 v19): (0.0 1.0)`.
           
           **Outcome:** I believe this plan is both achievable and sound. It guarantees that all conditions of the axiom are met: images received, analyses transmitted, and rovers/stores back in their initial state. The configuration points are selected to fulfil all requirements of the domain.

           3.  **Stone Analysis:** Then, Rover v12 needs to move to sample and analyse the stone. Finally, return to the comms config, send the analysis to v9, and then reset back to its initial config (`v13`).
           
           **Rover `v14` (Soil):**
           *   **Sample & Analysis:**  Rover v14 will be deployed to go to the sampling location `#o5`, collect and analyse the sample, then send the analysis to the lander `v9`. After sending the results, it should discard the sample and go back to its initial config (`v15`).
           
           **Configuration Points:** Now comes the critical part—defining these "continuous" configuration points. I'm focusing on two:
           
           *   **`#o0` (Communication):**  The communication configuration has been assigned coordinates `(-1.5, -1.0)`. This point is reachable by both rovers, outside of known AABBs, and facilitates clear communication with the lander. The requirement of `comrange` predicates being true ensures that this also fulfills the range requirements for communication.
           *   **`#o3` (Imaging):** The imaging configuration has been assigned `(0.0, 1.0)` coordinates.  This location is chosen because the `imagerange` predicates are already true for each objective and since the objects are in a small range, this helps. This helps make the plan simpler. It is also collision free.
           *   `#o5` (Sample): I did not use coordinates for this configuration due to the lack of constraints.
           
           I've ensured to specify the continuous values using the syntax: `(#o0 v12 #o1 v9): (-1.5 -1.0)`, `(#o0 v14 #o1 v9): (-1.5 -1.0)`, `(#o3 v12 #o4 v17): (0.0 1.0)`, `(#o3 v12 #o4 v18): (0.0 1.0)`, `(#o3 v12 #o4 v19): (0.0 1.0)`.
           
           **Outcome:** I believe this plan is both achievable and sound. It guarantees that all conditions of the axiom are met: images received, analyses transmitted, and rovers/stores back in their initial state. The configuration points are selected to fulfil all requirements of the domain.

(Thoughts: **Navigating the Challenges: A Rover's Perspective**
           
           Okay, so the old plan crashed and burned. The main issue? We couldn't reach the specified location to communicate, and some object got in the way of a visual. Time to rethink everything!
           
           First, the obstacles: that vertical wall at x=0 is causing problems. It's a real barrier for our communication, since our landing area is near x=0. The main targets and sampling regions are also spread across this barrier. 
           
           We need new reachable and collision-free locations. Based on the problem at hand, we have some initial configurations and are looking to define values for `comvisible`, `imagevisible` predicates. Here's the situation:
           
           *   **Communication is key:** We gotta get our images and analyses back to the Lander. The `Landers position is near y=-2.0`. Given the wall obstacle, one of us will need to use the left side.
           *   **Imaging is tricky:** We need to capture visuals of all the objects (landing region), which means moving to some location that has all object within line of sight. It looks like we have 3 imaging locations.
           *   **Obstacles are real:** That vertical wall at x=0 acts like a barrier. We can't be *in* it, and it blocks our line of sight and movement.
           
           Here's my initial thinking:
           
           *   Since we need to report from the far side, that vertical bar is an actual barrier, which means one of us can't reach the landing area from our initial side.
           
           I'm thinking our approach needs a few changes. We'll need to define a path that makes the most sense. First, some rover has to do everything and work around the limitations that are given by that physical barrier. It seems that our best choice here is to use one rover to do all sampling, image capture, and transmission.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Plan Development**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of my thinking to address the plan revision request. The previous plan had issues with reachability, so that's the starting point. I need to make sure `v12` and `v14` can access their targets, avoiding the obstacle at x=0. I'm focusing on those reachability concerns, while adhering to the specifications provided in the original prompt.
           
           First, I looked at the objectives: imaging targets for `#o3` and communication for `#o0`, assigning them to either `v12` or `v14` based on their x-coordinates relative to the obstacle at x=0 (that's `v20`). Rover `v12` will stay to the right, and `v14` to the left. I'm also planning to use some of the same `v2` and `v6` rock analyses as the initial plan, as those are what's requested by the goal. The specific roles for each rover now:
           
           *   **v12:** Images `v17` and `v18`, samples a `v2` rock (rock type `v4` in this plan) and a `v6` rock (rock type `v5`). Then, `v12` will send the images and the rocks.
           *   **v14:** Images `v19` and sends that.
           
           For `v12`, I'm proposing a starting position of `(1.0, -1.75)` and going from there, so, to the right. The key is to find good, reachable positions for `v12`. I need to be sure that the angles are suitable, so the `imagerange` is considered (max distance 2.0). I'm planning `(1.5, 0.5)` for imaging (`#o3`). For communication, I'll go with `(1.0, -0.5)`. This will place the rover a safe distance away from the boundary at `x = 0`. I have verified all distances are less than 2.0 for images and less than 4.0 for comms, as per the rules of the world.
           
           Then, there's `v14`. I'm going to start at `(-1.0, -1.75)`, and I need to image `v19`. I've picked `(-1.0, 1.0)` for the imaging and `(-1.0, -1.0)` to communicate. All of this has to avoid that pesky obstacle and has to be far enough away from it.
           
           Now, for those problematic configurations:
           *   I'll provide specific configuration values for `#o3` for the imaging tasks and for `#o0` for the communication tasks. I have the `conf` state at the beginning.
           *   I will *not* provide explicit values for `#o5` for the sampling because the prompt only says I have to if the configuration name (in this case #o5) is the second argument to `imagevisible` *or* `comvisible`. Since `#o5` is only used with the `above` predicate, no continuous values are needed.
           
           The plan will be implemented in sequential steps and the intermediate positions will be made explicit. For `v12` at initial position `(1.0, -1.75)` :
           1.  Move to imaging.
           2.  Take images (`v17`, `v18`).
           3.  Sample rock (`v4`).
           4.  Send image, rock, analysis.
           5.  Sample rock (`v5`).
           6.  Send image, rock, analysis.
           
           For `v14` at initial position `(-1.0, -1.75)`:
           1.  Move to imaging (`v19`).
           2.  Send image.
           
           The actions I'm using are all provided, and I've double-checked that everything can be satisfied. I need to make sure that the rocks are dropped after the analyses are sent. The store for the analysis is full and must be dropped after the analysis is made.
           
           The final consideration is to ensure that the initial and final states are correct.

(Thoughts: **My Current Plan and Reasoning**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with generating a new plan, and honestly, I'm feeling a little frustrated. The previous one failed because of reachability issues, specifically for configurations related to `v12`. I'm going to start by re-evaluating the configurations I'm proposing.
           
           I know that `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)` and needs to image and communicate. The main constraint is that `v20`, an AABB at `((-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), (0.05, 2.5, 0.1))`, is blocking `x=0`. So, I must ensure `v12` stays on the positive x-axis side of that barrier.
           
           I’m revisiting the initial configurations. My proposed configurations were: `#o3 = (1.5, 0.5)` for imaging and `#o0 = (1.0, -0.5)` for communication. The system reports both are "not reachable". This is the problem. These should be very simple movements, a vertical move from `y=-1.75` to `y=-0.5` at the same `x`. No explicit obstacles are in the way.
           
           The problem description specifies that the goal is to make sure I am providing a 'reachable' configuration. My initial assumption was a straight-line motion would suffice, but I'm thinking I must provide a valid starting point, and that the pathfinding is being implicitly handled. However, I’m getting errors and it’s a bit of a head-scratcher.
           
           Given the repeated failures, I’m leaning towards the reachability problem being with the coordinates I've chosen. The statement says I have to find a reachable point (not a path). So, I'm going to pick locations that are *close* to `v13 = (1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           **Revised Approach**
           
           Let's re-evaluate what `v12` is doing: It needs to image `v17` at `(1.783, 1.807)` and `v18` at `(0.482, 1.915)`. Then, it needs to communicate with `v9` at `(-2.405, -2.346)`.
           
           *   For imaging, the *earlier* attempt with `(1.5, 0.5)` failed. Instead, I am trying `(1.0, -1.5)`. The issue is, this point is likely still too far from the targets.
               The `imagerange` is limited to a distance of 2. I need to be closer. The targets are quite high in 'y'. If I could move to *near* the targets, it should be possible to capture.
           
               The range is limited to 2.
           
               If I could choose a configuration close to `v17` that still respects the visibility constraints, and same with `v18`, maybe I can get this to work. I’ll make a note of this.
           
           *   To communicate, I need to stay within a range of 4. So the previous configuration of `(1.0, -0.5)` failed, let me move that closer to the original position.
           
           The problem states, "reachable from the rover's current configuration". It implies pathfinding; but without any detailed map, I have little to go on. So, I need to be a little more meticulous in coordinates. I'm going to try to choose locations that are much *closer* to the initial configuration `v13 = (1.0, -1.75)` while maintaining visibility.
           
           I'm making a mental note: I need separate imaging configurations for different targets, as the problem statement indicates I have to provide a different configuration for each visible item. I failed here before. I need to separate `v17` from `v18`.
           
           **Specific Configurations and Revised Plan**
           
           *   **v12**: Starting at `(1.0, -1.75)`
               *   Imaging Targets:
                   *   `v17` and `v18` - The solution will provide a solution for each target. The solution now provides a general solution.
                   *   I should use a point close to `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           
               *   Now let's revisit.
                   *   Try `(1.0, 0.0)` for imaging. The coordinates would be within 2 range for both images, according to the distance calculation.

           I'm making a mental note: I need separate imaging configurations for different targets, as the problem statement indicates I have to provide a different configuration for each visible item. I failed here before. I need to separate `v17` from `v18`.
           
           **Specific Configurations and Revised Plan**
           
           *   **v12**: Starting at `(1.0, -1.75)`
               *   Imaging Targets:
                   *   `v17` and `v18` - The solution will provide a solution for each target. The solution now provides a general solution.
                   *   I should use a point close to `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           
               *   Now let's revisit.
                   *   Try `(1.0, 0.0)` for imaging. The coordinates would be within 2 range for both images, according to the distance calculation.
