           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Okay, so I need to construct a plan to satisfy the conditions of this new axiom. The primary goal is achieving `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to:
           
           1.  **Image acquisition:** Get images of objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`) using a rover (`v12`).
           2.  **Analysis:** Analyze two types of rocks (one of type `v2` and one of type `v6`) and transmit the results.
           
           The initial state reveals a few key facts already true: `atconf`, `free`.
           
           To begin, the problem breaks down into two main sub-goals:
           
           *   **Image Goal:** To achieve `receivedimage(object, mode)`, I must utilize `send_image(rover, config, ray, target, object, mode)`. This requires satisfying `comvisible`, `objective`, `mode`, `haveimage`, and `atconf`, with a few of the predicates involving rays and blocking. In this case, rover `v12` will take images. I'll need to calibrate the camera and also send the data.
           *   **Analysis Goal:** To achieve `receivedanalysis(rock)`, I need `send_analysis(rover, config, ray, target, rock)`. This demands `comvisible`, `rock`, `analyzed`, `atconf`, and handling of blocked predicates.
           
           **Breaking Down the Plan:**
           
           1.  **Image Acquisition Phase:** Rover `v12` will be the primary instrument for this phase. To send images, `v12` must be at the correct configuration, `calibrate` and then `take_image`, then it sends the data.
               *   Image-related tasks must involve the image mode `v11`, and the camera `v10`.
               *   The `imagevisible` facts help to show where the targets (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`) can be seen, which will depend upon the rover's location.
               *   The com is through lander `v9`.
           
               I note that the rover `v12` has a limited set of `move` actions, which keeps it at location `v13`, so the image tasks will all be completed from that configuration. In short, the rover can't move to another location. I have also observed that a configuration `#o3` is used by the rover for imaging. The `imagevisible` facts are given in the initial state. The rover's initial and only location is `v13`. Given the available actions, `v12` can't move. I assume then, that configurations `#o3` and `#o0` must be `v13` (based on actions and the `conf` predicates), which simplifies the plan.
               So, it should calibrate the camera, take image and send it, for each target (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`).
           
           2.  **Analysis Phase:** Rover `v14` takes the lead here. For this phase:
               *   The key action is `sample_rock`.
               *   Rocks of types `v2` and `v6` are available. I'll pick rock `v1` of type `v2` and rock `v5` of type `v6`
               *   Rover will use the store `v16`.
               *   It also has available com facts (configuration `#o0`) to transmit back to lander.
           
               Also, `v14` has a similar constraint: it's stuck at `v15` due to its available `move` action. And, similar to `v12`, configurations are linked to the location and target.
               In short, the rover samples a rock, sends, drops, and then samples a different rock and sends.
           
           **Plan Construction**
           Given the observations and constraints, a feasible plan emerges:
           
           1.  **Image Acquisition by Rover v12 (location v13, mode v11, cam v10):**
               *   Calibrate the camera for `v17`.
               *   Take the image of `v17`.
               *   Send the image of `v17`.
               *   Calibrate the camera for `v18`.
               *   Take the image of `v18`.
               *   Send the image of `v18`.
               *   Calibrate the camera for `v19`.
               *   Take the image of `v19`.
               *   Send the image of `v19`.

(Thoughts: **Re-Evaluating Plan Feasibility**
           
           Okay, so I've been alerted that my previous plan wasn't kosher; it included actions outside of the provided list.  I need to go back to basics and rigorously re-evaluate the problem based *solely* on these actions: essentially no-ops (moving rovers to the same location) and dropping rocks.  Let's see if this drastically limited set of actions can get us to the goal.
           
           The goal, `new-axiom@0()`, is a conjunction of several conditions. I need to make sure I understand the initial state for the conditions of the goal. The problem is that there are no ways to receive images, nor to analyze rocks or soil, and I can only move to the same location and drop rocks.
           
           I'm starting to see a problem. The only actions that *can* change the state are the rock drops.  However, they only deal with the `full` and `free` predicates. The *key* unmet conditions are the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. I can't find a way to make them true. Moreover, the `drop_rock` action depends on a `full` precondition.  I can't *cause* `full` without some kind of sampling, and sampling isn't on the list.
           
           The conclusion is unavoidable: given these severely restricted actions, this goal state is simply *unreachable*. No combination of no-ops and rock drops can satisfy the goal's requirements. It's a dead end.

The *key* unmet conditions are the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. I can't find a way to make them true. Moreover, the `drop_rock` action depends on a `full` precondition.  I can't *cause* `full` without some kind of sampling, and sampling isn't on the list.
           
           The conclusion is unavoidable: given these severely restricted actions, this goal state is simply *unreachable*. No combination of no-ops and rock drops can satisfy the goal's requirements. It's a dead end.
