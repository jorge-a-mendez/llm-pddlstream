           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27. The object is also square, with side length approximately 0.0939. This means the object is significantly smaller than the surface and should be easy to place. Since it's a square object on a square surface, any rotation will be stable as long as the object's center is within the bounds, considering its half-extents.
           
           The surface's x and y range from -0.135 to 0.135.
           The object's half-extents are approximately 0.0939 / 2 = 0.04695.
           For a stable placement without rotation, the center (x, y) should be such that:
           -0.135 + 0.04695 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.04695
           -0.08805 <= x <= 0.08805
           
           -0.135 + 0.04695 <= y <= 0.135 - 0.04695
           -0.08805 <= y <= 0.08805
           
           For rotated placements, the maximum extent of the square object rotated by 45 degrees is sqrt(2) * (side / 2) = sqrt(2) * 0.04695 = 0.0664. This is still well within the surface boundaries. So, any rotation is fine as long as the center is within the above calculated bounds.
           
           I will generate placements covering a range of positions and rotations within these limits.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I need to place object ID 5 on surface 0.
           The surface 0 is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           Object ID 5 has extents `(0.09746026601974822, 0.09746026601974822)`. This is a square object with side length approximately 0.09746.
           The half-extents of object 5 are `0.09746 / 2 = 0.04873`.
           
           I must also avoid collision with object ID 6, which was successfully placed at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`.
           Object ID 6 has extents `(0.09391448034107291, 0.09391448034107297)`.
           The half-extents of object 6 are `0.09391 / 2 = 0.04695`.
           
           Both objects are squares.
           Object 6 is centered at (0,0) with no rotation. Its bounding box is `(-0.04695, -0.04695)` to `(0.04695, 0.04695)`.
           
           To avoid collision between two axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs), their x-intervals must not overlap, or their y-intervals must not overlap.
           For object 5 (let its center be (x5, y5) and half-extents hx5, hy5), its AABB is `(x5-hx5, y5-hy5)` to `(x5+hx5, y5+hy5)`.
           For object 6, its AABB is `(-0.04695, -0.04695)` to `(0.04695, 0.04695)`.
           
           The condition for *no* overlap is:
           `(x5 + hx5 < -0.04695)` OR `(x5 - hx5 > 0.04695)` OR
           `(y5 + hy5 < -0.04695)` OR `(y5 - hy5 > 0.04695)`
           
           Substituting hx5 = hy5 = 0.04873:
           `(x5 + 0.04873 < -0.04695)` OR `(x5 - 0.04873 > 0.04695)` OR
           `(y5 + 0.04873 < -0.04695)` OR `(y5 - 0.04873 > 0.04695)`
           
           Simplifying:
           `x5 < -0.04695 - 0.04873 = -0.09568` OR `x5 > 0.04695 + 0.04873 = 0.09568` OR
           `y5 < -0.04695 - 0.04873 = -0.09568` OR `y5 > 0.04695 + 0.04873 = 0.09568`
           
           So, the center of object 5 must be outside the square `(-0.09568, -0.09568)` to `(0.09568, 0.09568)`.
           
           Additionally, object 5 must be within the surface 0 boundaries.
           The surface's x and y range from -0.135 to 0.135.
           For object 5 (half-extent 0.04873), its center (x, y) should be such that:
           -0.135 + 0.04873 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.04873
           -0.08627 <= x <= 0.08627
           
           -0.135 + 0.04873 <= y <= 0.135 - 0.04873
           -0.08627 <= y <= 0.08627
           
           Combining these conditions, it's clear there are no valid placements for object 5 if it's placed with 0 rotation because its required x or y extent (up to 0.09568) for non-collision is larger than the available space (up to 0.08627). This means there's no way to place object 5 axis-aligned without colliding with object 6.
           
           However, the placement of object 5 can be rotated. When rotated by 45 degrees, the diagonal half-extent is `sqrt(2) * 0.04873 = 0.0689`. This is still within the `0.08627` bounds.
           Let's re-evaluate the non-collision condition with rotation for object 5. If object 5 is rotated, its effective axis-aligned bounding box will be larger.
           If object 5 is rotated by 45 degrees, its new half-extents for its AABB are `0.0689`.
           So, the surface bounds for a rotated object 5 are:
           -0.135 + 0.0689 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.0689
           -0.0661 <= x <= 0.0661
           
           And for collision with object 6 (which is not rotated, its half-extents are 0.04695):
           `(x5 + 0.0689 < -0.04695)` OR `(x5 - 0.0689 > 0.04695)` OR
           `(y5 + 0.0689 < -0.04695)` OR `(y5 - 0.0689 > 0.04695)`
           
           Simplifying:
           `x5 < -0.04695 - 0.0689 = -0.11585` OR `x5 > 0.04695 + 0.0689 = 0.11585` OR
           `y5 < -0.04695 - 0.0689 = -0.11585` OR `y5 > 0.04695 + 0.0689 = 0.11585`
           
           So the center of object 5 (when rotated by 45 degrees) must be outside the square `(-0.11585, -0.11585)` to `(0.11585, 0.11585)`.
           However, the allowed range for the center of object 5 due to surface bounds is `(-0.0661, -0.0661)` to `(0.0661, 0.0661)`.
           
           This means there's no way to place object 5, even rotated, such that its AABB does not overlap with object 6's AABB, AND it is still within the surface boundaries.
           
           Let me double check the exact collision logic. If I have object A at (xA, yA) with dimensions (sAx, sAy) and object B at (xB, yB) with dimensions (sBx, sBy). They collide if:
           abs(xA - xB) < (sAx + sBx) / 2 AND abs(yA - yB) < (sAy + sBy) / 2
           
           For A=object 5, B=object 6.
           Object 6: (xB,yB) = (0,0), sBx=0.09391, sBy=0.09391. half-extents = 0.046955
           Object 5: (xA,yA), sAx=0.09746, sAy=0.09746. half-extents = 0.04873
           
           Collision if:
           abs(xA - 0) < (0.04873 + 0.046955) AND abs(yA - 0) < (0.04873 + 0.046955)
           abs(xA) < 0.095685 AND abs(yA) < 0.095685
           
           So, object 5's center (xA, yA) must NOT satisfy these conditions for no collision.
           Therefore, `abs(xA) >= 0.095685` OR `abs(yA) >= 0.095685`.
           
           Now, surface bounds for object 5.
           Center (xA, yA) must be within:
           -0.135 + 0.04873 <= xA <= 0.135 - 0.04873 => -0.08627 <= xA <= 0.08627
           -0.135 + 0.04873 <= yA <= 0.135 - 0.04873 => -0.08627 <= yA <= 0.08627
           
           The maximum absolute x or y coordinate for object 5's center is 0.08627.
           The minimum absolute x or y coordinate needed to avoid collision is 0.095685.
           
           Since `0.08627 < 0.095685`, there is *no* axis-aligned placement for object 5 that avoids collision with object 6 AND stays on the surface.
           
           This is a scenario where I must consider rotation. The AABB of a rotated square object with side `s` at angle `theta` has dimensions `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This is maximized at 45 degrees.
           When `theta = pi/4` (45 degrees), the effective side length for the AABB is `0.09746 * (1/sqrt(2) + 1/sqrt(2)) = 0.09746 * sqrt(2) = 0.13783`.
           The half-extents for the AABB of object 5 when rotated by 45 degrees are `0.13783 / 2 = 0.068915`.
           
           Now let's recalculate the surface bounds for object 5 rotated by 45 degrees.
           -0.135 + 0.068915 <= xA <= 0.135 - 0.068915
           -0.066085 <= xA <= 0.066085
           
           -0.135 + 0.068915 <= yA <= 0.135 - 0.068915
           -0.066085 <= yA <= 0.066085
           
           Now, collision with object 6. Object 6 is not rotated, so its AABB is fixed.
           Object 6 half-extents are 0.04695.
           Object 5 (rotated by 45 degrees) half-extents are 0.068915.
           
           Collision if:
           abs(xA) < (0.068915 + 0.04695) AND abs(yA) < (0.068915 + 0.04695)
           abs(xA) < 0.115865 AND abs(yA) < 0.115865
           
           So, for no collision: `abs(xA) >= 0.115865` OR `abs(yA) >= 0.115865`.
           But the maximum absolute x or y for the center (due to surface bounds) is 0.066085.
           
           Again, `0.066085 < 0.115865`. This indicates that there is no placement for object 5 (even with rotation) that avoids collision with object 6 and stays within the surface.
           This is a challenging situation. I need to make a placement, even if it might fail. I should prioritize placing it on the surface.
           
           Let me review the problem statement "You must find a stable placement for the object on one of the surfaces. The placement must be stable, meaning that the object is fully contained within the bounds of the surface." And "If you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene."
           
           The problem explicitly asks me to provide 50 placements. It does not state that I should give up if I think no placement is possible. I will provide placements, trying to adhere to the given constraints as best as possible. The previous successful placement for ID 6 is static and must be avoided. My calculations strongly indicate there's no way to avoid ID 6's AABB while staying on the surface.
           
           Perhaps my understanding of "avoid collision between objects i and j" is too strict and assumes AABB overlap. If the objects are actual squares, then their actual geometry might allow for placement.
           Object 6: Square, center (0,0), side 0.09391. Vertices: (0.04695, 0.04695), (-0.04695, 0.04695), etc.
           Object 5: Square, side 0.09746.
           
           If object 5 is rotated by pi/4 (45 degrees), its corners are further out. Let's try placing object 5 such that it attempts to 'fit' into the corners of surface 0, potentially trying to skirt object 6.
           Smallest possible distance to avoid collision for squares.
           The minimal distance between the centers of two squares of sides s1 and s2, aligned with axes, is `(s1+s2)/2`. For a general rotation, this calculation is very complex.
           
           Given the instructions, I *must* generate 50 placements. Since my AABB analysis shows no available space, I'm going to generate placements on the surface, pushing object 5 as far as possible from object 6's center. These will likely collide with object 6, but I have to make a placement. I will try to maximize the distance from the center (0,0).
           
           Maximum center for object 5 (unrotated) on surface 0 is `0.08627`.
           I will place object 5's center near these maximums, and also try some rotated positions near these maximums, even though my calculations suggest they collide.

Model:     I need to place object ID 4 on surface 0, avoiding collision with objects ID 6 and ID 5.

           Object ID 4 extents: `(0.0806486355678866, 0.0806486355678866)`. This is a square object with side length `s4 = 0.0806486355678866`.
           Half-extents for object 4: `h4 = s4 / 2 = 0.0403243177839433`.

           AABB for object 5: `(0.086 - h5, 0 - h5)` to `(0.086 + h5, 0 + h5)`.
           `x_min5 = 0.086 - 0.04873 = 0.03727`
           `x_max5 = 0.086 + 0.04873 = 0.13473`
           `y_min5 = -0.04873`
           `y_max5 = 0.04873`
           AABB for object 5: `(0.03727, -0.04873)` to `(0.13473, 0.04873)`.
           
           Surface bounds for object 4 (unrotated, half-extents `h4 = 0.04032`):
           `x_min_surf = -0.135 + h4 = -0.135 + 0.04032 = -0.09468`
           `x_max_surf = 0.135 - h4 = 0.135 - 0.04032 = 0.09468`
           `y_min_surf = -0.135 + h4 = -0.09468`
           `y_max_surf = 0.135 - h4 = 0.09468`
           So, object 4's center `(x4, y4)` must be within `(-0.09468, -0.09468)` to `(0.09468, 0.09468)`.
           
           Collision avoidance for object 4 (center `(x4, y4)`, half-extents `h4 = 0.04032`):
           
           Vs object 6 (center `(0,0)`, half-extents `h6 = 0.046957`):
           No collision if: `abs(x4) >= (h4 + h6)` OR `abs(y4) >= (h4 + h6)`
           `h4 + h6 = 0.04032 + 0.046957 = 0.087277`
           So, `abs(x4) >= 0.087277` OR `abs(y4) >= 0.087277`.
           
           Vs object 5 (center `(0.086, 0)`, half-extents `h5 = 0.04873`):
           No collision if: `abs(x4 - 0.086) >= (h4 + h5)` OR `abs(y4 - 0) >= (h4 + h5)`
           `h4 + h5 = 0.04032 + 0.04873 = 0.08905`
           So, `abs(x4 - 0.086) >= 0.08905` OR `abs(y4) >= 0.08905`.
           
           Let's look for a region that satisfies all constraints.
           From surface bounds: `x4` in `[-0.09468, 0.09468]`, `y4` in `[-0.09468, 0.09468]`.
           
           From object 6: We need `abs(x4) >= 0.087277` OR `abs(y4) >= 0.087277`.
           This means `x4` can be in `[-0.09468, -0.087277]` or `[0.087277, 0.09468]`.
           Or `y4` can be in `[-0.09468, -0.087277]` or `[0.087277, 0.09468]`.
           
           From object 5: `abs(x4 - 0.086) >= 0.08905` OR `abs(y4) >= 0.08905`.
           `x4 - 0.086 >= 0.08905` => `x4 >= 0.17505` (this is outside surface bounds, max is 0.09468)
           `x4 - 0.086 <= -0.08905` => `x4 <= -0.00305`
           So for x, we need `x4 <= -0.00305`.
           And for y, we need `abs(y4) >= 0.08905`.
           
           Combining the conditions:
           We need `(abs(x4) >= 0.087277` OR `abs(y4) >= 0.087277) AND (x4 <= -0.00305` OR `abs(y4) >= 0.08905)`.
           And `x4, y4` must be in `[-0.09468, 0.09468]`.
           
           Let's test some regions.
           1. Try to place in the far left: `x4` close to -0.09468.
           If `x4 = -0.09`, `y4 = 0.0`.
              - Surface: OK, `abs(-0.09) < 0.09468`.
              - Vs 6: `abs(-0.09) = 0.09`. This is `>= 0.087277`. So, no collision with 6.
              - Vs 5: `x4 = -0.09`. This is `<= -0.00305`. So, no collision with 5.
           This position `(-0.09, 0.0)` seems valid.
           
           Let's try to find more placements.
           What if `y4` is large (positive or negative)?
           If `y4 = 0.09`:
              - Surface: OK, `abs(0.09) < 0.09468`.
              - Vs 6: `abs(0.09) = 0.09`. This is `>= 0.087277`. So, no collision with 6 (as long as x4 is not too small).
              - Vs 5: `abs(0.09) = 0.09`. This is `>= 0.08905`. So, no collision with 5.
           So, any `(x4, 0.09)` or `(x4, -0.09)` where `x4` is within surface bounds `[-0.09468, 0.09468]` should work.
           Example: `(0.0, 0.09)` is a valid placement.
           
           Let's explore rotations. Object 4 is a square, so rotating it by any angle `theta` will change its AABB.
           Max half-extent for rotated object 4 is at `theta = pi/4`: `h4_rot = h4 * sqrt(2) = 0.04032 * sqrt(2) = 0.05702`.
           Surface bounds for rotated object 4 (half-extents `h4_rot = 0.05702`):
           `x_min_surf = -0.135 + h4_rot = -0.135 + 0.05702 = -0.07798`
           `x_max_surf = 0.135 - h4_rot = 0.135 - 0.05702 = 0.07798`
           `y_min_surf = -0.07798`
           `y_max_surf = 0.07798`
           So, object 4's center `(x4, y4)` must be within `(-0.07798, -0.07798)` to `(0.07798, 0.07798)`.
           
           Collision avoidance for object 4 (center `(x4, y4)`, rotated AABB half-extents `h4_rot = 0.05702`):
           
           Vs object 6 (center `(0,0)`, half-extents `h6 = 0.046957`):
           No collision if: `abs(x4) >= (h4_rot + h6)` OR `abs(y4) >= (h4_rot + h6)`
           `h4_rot + h6 = 0.05702 + 0.046957 = 0.103977`
           So, `abs(x4) >= 0.103977` OR `abs(y4) >= 0.103977`.
           This is outside the rotated surface bounds (`x,y` max abs value is 0.07798). So, if object 4 is rotated by 45 degrees, it *cannot* avoid object 6's AABB while staying on the surface.
           
           This is a very tricky scenario. It seems that if I rotate object 4, it can't avoid object 6. If I don't rotate object 4, it has more space. This suggests I should prioritize unrotated placements, or small rotations that don't increase the AABB much.
           The problem statement says: "You never give up. No matter how many times you fail to provide a placement, or how many valid placements you have already provided, you will always try to find a new placement."
           And the previous feedback included: `(ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.086, 0.0` as a success, which my AABB collision check indicated should have collided with object 6.
           Let's re-check the previous success for ID 5.
           Object 5 (center 0.086, 0), h5 = 0.04873. AABB for object 5 is `(0.03727, -0.04873)` to `(0.13473, 0.04873)`.
           Object 6 (center 0,0), h6 = 0.046957. AABB for object 6 is `(-0.046957, -0.046957)` to `(0.046957, 0.046957)`.
           These AABBs *do* overlap in x: `(0.03727, 0.046957)` and y: `(-0.046957, 0.046957)`.
           
           This implies that the collision check is not based purely on AABB overlap, or there is some tolerance, or the actual geometry of the objects (squares) is used.
           Given the previous success `(ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.086, 0.0`, it implies that object 5, even with its AABB overlapping with object 6's AABB, was not considered a collision.
           The distance between centers (0.086, 0) and (0,0) is 0.086.
           For object 5 and 6, the sum of half-extents is `h5 + h6 = 0.04873 + 0.046957 = 0.095687`.
           Since `0.086 < 0.095687`, their AABBs clearly overlap.
           
           This suggests a different interpretation of collision. Perhaps the actual square geometry is used, and it's not a full AABB check. Or the "collision with any of the fixed obstacles" rule is applied differently from "avoid collision between objects i and j". Since ID 6 is fixed (from the first request), and ID 5 is now also considered fixed (because it was a success), I should use the known successful placements as true non-collisions.
           
           The success of object 5 at (0.086, 0.0) means that a non-overlapping space exists between (0,0) and (0.086, 0.0). This means a space that *my AABB calculation says would be a collision* is actually valid. This is crucial information.
           
           Let's assume the success means that any part of object 5 outside the strict AABB of object 6 does not count as collision, or a minimum separation distance is used for the *actual* square objects.
           
           Given that ID 5 was placed successfully right next to ID 6, I should try placing ID 4 in a similar fashion.
           ID 6 is at (0,0). Side length `s6 = 0.09391`.
           ID 5 is at (0.086, 0). Side length `s5 = 0.09746`.
           Object 4 has side length `s4 = 0.080648`.
           
           Let's try to place object 4 at `x = -0.086, y = 0.0`, by symmetry with object 5's placement.
           Center (x4,y4) = (-0.086, 0.0).
           Surface bounds for unrotated object 4: `[-0.09468, 0.09468]`. This is satisfied.
           
           Collision with object 6:
           Center distances: `abs(-0.086 - 0) = 0.086`. `abs(0 - 0) = 0`.
           Sum of half-extents: `h4 + h6 = 0.04032 + 0.046957 = 0.087277`.
           Since `0.086 < 0.087277`, the AABBs overlap.
           However, based on the success of object 5, this *might* be fine.
           
           Collision with object 5:
           Center distances: `abs(-0.086 - 0.086) = 0.172`. `abs(0 - 0) = 0`.
           Sum of half-extents: `h4 + h5 = 0.04032 + 0.04873 = 0.08905`.
           Since `0.172 > 0.08905`, these two objects should *not* collide, even by AABB. This is a safe placement regarding object 5.
           
           So, `(-0.086, 0.0)` for object 4 (unrotated) should be valid because it avoids object 5's AABB, and its collision with object 6 is symmetric to object 5's successful "non-collision" with object 6.
           
           I will proceed by making placements that leverage this implicit information: placements near the fixed objects, which according to my AABB calculations would overlap, but which the system has indicated are successful.
           I will generate placements that are far enough from object 5 to satisfy AABB non-collision, and then try placements near object 6, assuming a similar tolerance or non-AABB check as for object 5.
           
           Safe placements considering object 5 AABB (center `(0.086, 0)`, `h5=0.04873`):
           `abs(x4 - 0.086) >= 0.08905` OR `abs(y4) >= 0.08905`.
           This means: `x4 >= 0.17505` (out of bounds) OR `x4 <= -0.00305` OR `abs(y4) >= 0.08905`.
           Valid range for `x4`: `[-0.09468, -0.00305]`.
           Valid range for `y4`: `[-0.09468, 0.09468]`.
           
           Now, considering object 6 (center `(0,0)`, `h6=0.046957`):
           `abs(x4) >= 0.087277` OR `abs(y4) >= 0.087277`.
           
           Let's try:
           1. `x4` in `[-0.09468, -0.00305]`, `y4` in `[-0.09468, 0.09468]`.
              - Consider `x4 = -0.09`, `y4 = 0.0`. (This falls in `x4 <= -0.00305`).
                - Check vs 6: `abs(-0.09) = 0.09`, which is `>= 0.087277`. So, no AABB overlap with 6. This is a fully safe placement by AABB rules.
              - Consider `x4 = -0.05`, `y4 = 0.09`. (This falls in `x4 <= -0.00305`).
                - Check vs 6: `abs(0.09) = 0.09`, which is `>= 0.087277`. So, no AABB overlap with 6. This is also safe by AABB.
           
           This implies there are valid placements by AABB rules! My earlier reasoning about object 5 being too large was flawed for object 4. The `x4 <= -0.00305` condition is the key.
           
           Let's use this strategy:
           1. Prioritize placements that are fully AABB non-colliding with both 5 and 6.
              - Need `x4` in `[-0.09468, -0.00305]`.
              - Need `y4` in `[-0.09468, 0.09468]`.
              - And (`abs(x4) >= 0.087277` OR `abs(y4) >= 0.087277`).
           
           So, valid x range `[-0.09468, -0.087277]` (e.g. `x4 = -0.09`).
           Or valid y range `[-0.09468, -0.087277]` or `[0.087277, 0.09468]`.
           A good region for `x4` would be `[-0.09, -0.087277]`.
           A good region for `y4` would be `[-0.09, -0.087277]` or `[0.087277, 0.09]`.
           
           Example for AABB non-collision: `(-0.09, 0.0)`
           `x4 = -0.09`, `y4 = 0.0`.
              - Surface bounds `(-0.09468, 0.09468)`: OK.
              - Vs 6: `abs(x4) = 0.09 >= 0.087277`. OK.
              - Vs 5: `x4 = -0.09 <= -0.00305`. OK.
           
           Another example: `(0.0, 0.09)`
           `x4 = 0.0`, `y4 = 0.09`.
              - Surface bounds `(-0.09468, 0.09468)`: OK.
              - Vs 6: `abs(y4) = 0.09 >= 0.087277`. OK.
              - Vs 5: `abs(y4) = 0.09 >= 0.08905`. OK.
           
           These look perfectly valid by strict AABB non-collision.
           
           I will prioritize these "strictly non-colliding" placements first, then if I run out, I will use placements similar to ID 5's, which were "successfully colliding" via AABB check.
           
           For rotations:
           As calculated, `h4_rot = 0.05702`.
           Surface for rotated object 4: `x,y` in `[-0.07798, 0.07798]`.
           Vs 6: Need `abs(x4) >= 0.103977` OR `abs(y4) >= 0.103977`. No such placement possible.
           Vs 5: Need `abs(x4 - 0.086) >= (h4_rot + h5) = 0.05702 + 0.04873 = 0.10575`.
              `x4 - 0.086 >= 0.10575` => `x4 >= 0.19175` (out of bounds)
              `x4 - 0.086 <= -0.10575` => `x4 <= -0.01975`.
              OR `abs(y4) >= 0.10575` (out of bounds).
           So, if rotated, need `x4 <= -0.01975` (and within `[-0.07798, 0.07798]`). So `x4` in `[-0.07798, -0.01975]`.
           But these placements *still* would collide with object 6's AABB (because they don't satisfy the `abs(x4) >= 0.103977` OR `abs(y4) >= 0.103977` condition within the rotated surface bounds).
           
           So it seems that for rotations, I will always "collide" by AABB with object 6. In this case, I will apply the same logic as for object 5's success: try to place it as far as possible while still making sense, using some rotational diversity.
           
           Let's start with axis-aligned positions that avoid AABB collision for both.
           Points like `(-0.09, 0.0)`, `(0.0, 0.09)`, `(-0.09, 0.09)`, `(-0.09, -0.09)`, `(0.09, -0.09)`.
           `0.09468` is max allowed abs coord. `0.087277` is min abs coord to avoid 6. `0.08905` is min abs y coord to avoid 5. `0.00305` is max x coord to avoid 5.
           
           Candidate locations (unrotated):
           - `x` from `(-0.094, -0.087)` and `y` near `0` (e.g. `(-0.09, 0.0)`)
           - `y` from `(0.089, 0.094)` and `x` from `(-0.094, 0.094)` (e.g. `(0.0, 0.09)`)
           - `y` from `(-0.094, -0.089)` and `x` from `(-0.094, 0.094)` (e.g. `(0.0, -0.09)`)
           
           Placements:
           (0, 0.0, -0.09, 0.0)
           (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.09)
           (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.09)
           (0, 0.0, -0.09, 0.09)
           (0, 0.0, -0.09, -0.09)
           (0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.09)
           (0, 0.0, -0.05, 0.09)
           (0, 0.0, 0.05, -0.09)
           (0, 0.0, -0.05, -0.09)
           (0, 0.0, -0.09, 0.05)
           (0, 0.0, -0.09, -0.05)
           (0, 0.0, -0.092, 0.0)
           (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.092)
           (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.092)
           (0, 0.0, -0.092, 0.092)
           (0, 0.0, 0.092, -0.092)
           
           Now some rotated placements. Since strict AABB collision avoidance is impossible for rotated object 4 and object 6, I will put them in locations that make sense on the surface and are far from the center (where 6 is) and from 5, hoping for a similar tolerance as seen for object 5. Max center abs for rotated object is 0.07798.
           (0, 0.7853981633974483, -0.07, 0.0)

           (0, 0.7853981633974483, -0.07, -0.05)
           
           Let's try some small angles of rotation to see if that helps "squeeze" past the AABB constraints while not increasing the AABB much.
           (0, 0.1, -0.09, 0.0)
           (0, 0.1, 0.0, 0.09)
           (0, 0.1, 0.0, -0.09)
           (0, 0.1, -0.09, 0.09)
           (0, 0.1, -0.09, -0.09)
           
           Let's try other rotations too.
