User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a 5x5 square defined by obstacles 0-4, with a vertical divider (obstacle 5) at x=0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the scene. The robot base must be within 2 units of the target point and within the overall x,y limits of [-2.5, 2.5]. I will try to find positions around the target point that avoid the known obstacles.

Model:     The previous two positions collided with obstacle 5, the vertical divider at x=0. This is helpful to know. The target point is (2.001335859298706 2.155071973800659). This means I should try to stay on the positive x side of the divider, or if I go to the negative side, ensure there's a clear line of sight around the divider and other obstacles. The remaining valid position from the last request (1.1706683938499298 2.054044594584288) is still a good candidate, as it is on the correct side of the divider and within range of the target.

Model:     The previous set of positions all failed for a new target point (-1.866162896156311 2.1427173614501953) due to no line of sight. This makes sense as the prior positions were all on the positive X side of the map, and the target is now on the negative X side, with obstacle 5 (the x=0 divider) blocking the view. Also, the first two failed for the initial target due to collision with obstacle 5.
           
           For this new target point (-1.866162896156311 2.1427173614501953), I need to find positions on the negative x side of the map, within 2 units of the target. I should also avoid obstacles 6, 8, 10, and 19 which are on this side of the map.
