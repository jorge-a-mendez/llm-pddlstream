           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Problem Analysis and Unreachability**
           
           My primary objective is to develop a plan to place objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto object `v16`.  This requires executing `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  The system is modeled with two arms, `v4` and `v6`, but the provided kinematic information (`kin` facts) only focuses on arm `v4`.  The robot begins with both arms empty and the three target objects each supported on object `v11`.
           
           The initial assessment reveals a fundamental issue: The `kin` actions, which are crucial for picking and placing, demand that the robot base be at configuration `#o3` (through `atbconf(#o3)`). However, the initial state states the base is at configuration `v3` and the sole available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action effectively moves the robot from `v3` to `v3`, which prevents achieving the required state `atbconf(#o3)`. Consequently, all `pick` and `place` actions that depend on `atbconf(#o3)` are inaccessible.
           
           The absence of a valid path to `#o3` renders the goal unattainable. Even though the system has an action `move_base`, it is limited as it only transitions from the current configuration to itself. There are no available instructions to change the base configuration and thereby make `pick` and `place` moves possible.  This implies the current planning problem is unsolvable.
