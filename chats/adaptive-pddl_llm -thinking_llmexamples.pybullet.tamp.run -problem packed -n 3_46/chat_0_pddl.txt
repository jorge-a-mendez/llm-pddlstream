User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object

           v9: object
           ```
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom canmove()

           Atom atpose(v14, v15)

           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom arm(v4)

           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom supported(v14, v15, v11)
           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Unattainable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm looking at a planning problem where I need to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`.  Essentially, I need to manipulate these three objects to change their relative positions.  I've got the initial state, the goal state, and a bunch of facts describing the scene and the robot's capabilities.  It's pretty standard:  objects can be grasped, they have poses, they're supported by other objects, and the robot has arms and a base. I am familiar with these kinds of planning problems.
           
           Looking at the initial state, those three objects are currently "on" `v11`. To achieve the goal, they need to be "on" `v16`.  This means I need to move these objects.  I am thinking that I need to pick them from v11 and place them on v16. However, I have noticed the important constraint.
           
           The critical issue is the available actions.  I'm only given a *single* action: `move_base`.  No `pick` or `place` actions are listed as valid. I have to create a plan with only the ability to move the robot's base.  The preconditions for `pick` and `place` are fairly standard, including things like the hand being empty and the robot being at the correct base configuration.
           
           Given this limitation, I'm stuck. To change the "on" relation, I'd need to change the `atpose` predicate associated with the objects.  But the only ways to change those positions are through `pick` and `place`, and those are *explicitly* disallowed by the available actions.
           
           Since `pick` and `place` are unavailable, there's no way to manipulate those objects. Because the only action available is `move_base`, I can't achieve the goal. No matter what base trajectory I use, it's impossible.
