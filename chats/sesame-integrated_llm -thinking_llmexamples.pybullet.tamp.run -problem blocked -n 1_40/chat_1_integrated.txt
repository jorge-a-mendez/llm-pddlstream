           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which means placing an object, let's call it `?green`, onto the surface `v18`. From the initial state, I know `?green` can be either object `v8` or `v12`.  The predicate `on(?green, v18)` requires that `supported(?green, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(?green, ?p)` are both true for some pose `?p`.  Looking at the available data, I see both `v8` and `v12` have poses where they are already supported by `v18`.
           
           Focusing on `v8` for now, it's graspable and has multiple supported poses. Specifically, the pose `p3` looks promising because `supported(v8, p3, v18)` is true. Therefore, my plan is to place `v8` at pose `p3`.
           
           The initial state shows that `v8` is currently at pose `v9`, so I need to move it. My thought process is broken down into these steps:
           
           1.  **Move the base robot to a suitable configuration (`#q0`) to pick `v8`.** The available action is `move_base`. Precondition `atbconf(v3)` is true.
           2.  **Pick up `v8` from `v9`.** The available action is `pick`. Preconditions include that the base is in the right configuration (`atbconf(#q0)`), that `v8` is at pose `v9`, and that the robot hand is empty. After pick, the object will be in the gripper, and the base can move.
           3.  **Move the base robot to a suitable configuration (`#q1`) near the place position `p3`.** Use `move_base` action. Precondition `atbconf(#q0)` is true after the pick action.
           4.  **Place `v8` at `p3`.** The action is `place`. Preconditions include having `v8` in the gripper (which I achieved with the `pick` action) and that the robot is at the configuration `#q1`.
           
           I've carefully considered the preconditions for each action, particularly the `canmove()` predicate which is consumed during the `move_base` and restored after `pick`/`place`, to make sure the sequence is correct.
           
           After the `place` action, the state `on(v8, v18)` will be true because `atpose(v8, p3)` will be true and `supported(v8, p3, v18)` is in the initial state. Because `type(v8, v17)` is also true, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is satisfied.
           
           I've also checked that the pose `p3` is within the AABB of the table `v18`, so placement is physically feasible.
           
           The cost will be a function of moving the base (twice) and picking/placing (which I can't optimize further). Thus, this sequence of actions should be optimal.
