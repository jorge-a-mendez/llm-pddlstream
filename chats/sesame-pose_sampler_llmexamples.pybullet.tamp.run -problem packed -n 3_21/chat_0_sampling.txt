           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27. The object is also square, with side length approximately 0.086.
           
           To find stable placements, I need to ensure the object is fully contained within the surface. The object can be rotated. Given the square shape of both the surface and the object, rotations by multiples of 90 degrees (or pi/2 radians) will result in the same effective bounding box for the object relative to its own center. Other angles will result in a larger effective bounding box. However, the current problem states object extents in terms of its AABB (axis-aligned bounding box). This implies that if I rotate the object, its bounding box will also rotate. The constraint is that the object's AABB must be within the surface's AABB.
           
           Let's assume the object's extents given are its intrinsic dimensions, and when I apply a rotation `theta`, the object's AABB will be rotated by `theta`. The problem statement says the object's dimensions are `(size_x, size_y)`, and then says "the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)". This wording is slightly ambiguous. I will interpret it as the dimensions of the object itself.
           
           If the object is placed with `theta = 0` (or any multiple of pi/2), its bounding box will be axis-aligned.
           Surface 0: `x_range = [-0.135, 0.135]`, `y_range = [-0.135, 0.135]`.
           Surface width = `0.135 - (-0.135) = 0.27`.
           Surface height = `0.135 - (-0.135) = 0.27`.
           Object width (size_x) = `0.08637571269039374`.
           Object height (size_y) = `0.08637571269039374`.
           
           Since the object is square and the surface is square, many orientations will be stable. I will prioritize placing the object in the center, and then exploring other positions within the surface. The object is relatively small compared to the surface, so there's plenty of space.
           
           For an object with width `W` and height `H` to be placed on a surface `(sx_min, sy_min)` to `(sx_max, sy_max)` with rotation `theta`:
           The center `(x, y)` of the object must satisfy:
           `sx_min + effective_half_width <= x <= sx_max - effective_half_width`
           `sy_min + effective_half_height <= y <= sy_max - effective_half_height`
           
           When `theta = 0`, `effective_half_width = W/2` and `effective_half_height = H/2`.
           `W/2 = 0.08637571269039374 / 2 = 0.04318785634519687`.
           `H/2 = 0.04318785634519687`.
           
           For surface 0:
           `x_min_placement = -0.135 + 0.04318785634519687 = -0.09181214365480313`
           `x_max_placement = 0.135 - 0.04318785634519687 = 0.09181214365480313`
           `y_min_placement = -0.09181214365480313`
           `y_max_placement = 0.09181214365480313`
           
           I will generate a variety of placements, varying position and orientation. I will use rotations of 0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2, and also some non-axis-aligned rotations like pi/4. For pi/4, the effective bounding box will be larger.
           For `theta = pi/4`, the effective width and height of the bounding box of the object become:
           `effective_width = W * abs(cos(theta)) + H * abs(sin(theta))`
           `effective_height = W * abs(sin(theta)) + H * abs(cos(theta))`
           Since `W = H`, this simplifies to `effective_width = W * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.
           For `theta = pi/4`, `cos(pi/4) = sin(pi/4) = 1/sqrt(2)`.
           `effective_width = W * (1/sqrt(2) + 1/sqrt(2)) = W * 2/sqrt(2) = W * sqrt(2)`.
           `effective_width = 0.08637571269039374 * sqrt(2) = 0.12219468`.
           `effective_half_width = 0.06109734`.
           
           New limits for `theta = pi/4`:
           `x_min_placement = -0.135 + 0.06109734 = -0.07390266`
           `x_max_placement = 0.135 - 0.06109734 = 0.07390266`
           `y_min_placement = -0.07390266`
           `y_max_placement = 0.07390266`
           These limits are still well within the surface boundaries.
           
           I will generate 50 unique stable placements.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface (surface 0) centered at the origin, with side length 0.27.
           I have successfully placed object 5 (square, side 0.08637) at `(0, 0, 0)` on surface 0. This means the central region of the surface is occupied by object 5.
           
           Now I need to place object 4, which is also square, with side length `0.07668231151913707`.
           Object 4 width = `0.07668231151913707`.
           Object 4 half-width = `0.038341155759568535`.
           
           I need to find a stable placement for object 4 on surface 0, such that it does not collide with object 5 (which is currently at `(0, 0, 0)`).
           
           The bounding box of object 5 (placed at `(0, 0, 0)` with `theta=0`) is:
           `x_min_5 = -0.04318785634519687`
           `x_max_5 = 0.04318785634519687`
           `y_min_5 = -0.04318785634519687`
           `y_max_5 = 0.04318785634519687`
           
           For object 4 to not collide with object 5, their bounding boxes must not overlap.
           The current strategy will be to place object 4 away from the center of the surface, ensuring its bounding box does not overlap with object 5's bounding box, and that it remains within surface 0's bounds.
           
           Surface 0 limits:
           `x_range = [-0.135, 0.135]`
           `y_range = [-0.135, 0.135]`
           
           For object 4 (half-width `0.038341155759568535`) with `theta=0`:
           Minimum x for object 4 center: `-0.135 + 0.038341155759568535 = -0.09665884424043147`
           Maximum x for object 4 center: `0.135 - 0.038341155759568535 = 0.09665884424043147`
           Same for y.
           
           Collision avoidance with object 5:
           If object 4 is to the right of object 5:
           `x_min_4 >= x_max_5`
           `x_center_4 - half_width_4 >= x_max_5`
           `x_center_4 >= x_max_5 + half_width_4`
           `x_center_4 >= 0.04318785634519687 + 0.038341155759568535 = 0.0815290121047654`
           
           If object 4 is to the left of object 5:
           `x_max_4 <= x_min_5`
           `x_center_4 + half_width_4 <= x_min_5`
           `x_center_4 <= x_min_5 - half_width_4`
           `x_center_4 <= -0.04318785634519687 - 0.038341155759568535 = -0.0815290121047654`
           
           Similar calculations apply for the y-coordinates.
           I will generate placements for object 4 in the corners and along the edges, avoiding the central region occupied by object 5.
           I will primarily use `theta = 0` for simplicity first, and then explore other orientations if needed.

           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 6) -- 0.09730374854888865, 0.09730374854888865)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface (surface 0) centered at the origin, with side length 0.27.
           
           I have two objects already placed:
           Object 5 (square, side 0.08637) at `(surf_idx=0, theta=0, x=0.0, y=0.0)`.
           Its bounding box (half-width `0.04318785634519687`):
           `x_min_5 = -0.04318785634519687`
           `x_max_5 = 0.04318785634519687`
           `y_min_5 = -0.04318785634519687`
           `y_max_5 = 0.04318785634519687`
           
           Object 4 (square, side 0.07668) at `(surf_idx=0, theta=0, x=0.09, y=0.0)`.
           Its bounding box (half-width `0.038341155759568535`):
           `x_min_4 = 0.09 - 0.038341155759568535 = 0.051658844240431465`
           `x_max_4 = 0.09 + 0.038341155759568535 = 0.12834115575956853`
           `y_min_4 = -0.038341155759568535`
           `y_max_4 = 0.038341155759568535`
           
           Now I need to place Object 6, which is also square, with side length `0.09730374854888865`.
           Object 6 half-width = `0.048651874274444325`.
           
           I need to find a stable placement for object 6 on surface 0, such that it does not collide with object 5 and object 4.
           
           Surface 0 limits:
           `x_range = [-0.135, 0.135]`
           `y_range = [-0.135, 0.135]`
           
           For object 6 (half-width `0.048651874274444325`) with `theta=0`:
           Minimum x for object 6 center: `-0.135 + 0.048651874274444325 = -0.08634812572555567`
           Maximum x for object 6 center: `0.135 - 0.048651874274444325 = 0.08634812572555567`
           Same for y.
           
           Object 6 is larger than Object 5 and Object 4. Its maximum x-center is `0.0863`. However, Object 4 is placed at `x=0.09`, which means Object 6 cannot be placed at `x=0.09` with `theta=0` without overlapping Object 4's bounding box that extends to `x_max_4 = 0.128`.
           
           Let's look at available space.
           The x-axis has Object 5 at `[-0.043, 0.043]` and Object 4 at `[0.051, 0.128]`.
           So, the region `[-0.043, 0.128]` along the x-axis is largely occupied or too narrow to fit Object 6 without overlap with `theta=0`.
           
           Possible placements for Object 6:
           1. To the left of Object 5 (negative x-axis):
              `x_max_6 <= x_min_5`
              `x_center_6 + half_width_6 <= x_min_5`
              `x_center_6 <= x_min_5 - half_width_6`
              `x_center_6 <= -0.04318785634519687 - 0.048651874274444325 = -0.0918397306196412`
              Valid x-range for center `[-0.08634, -0.09183]` -- this means there is no room to the left if considering strict non-overlap and surface bounds.
              Ah, wait. The surface bound for x_center_6 is `-0.086348`.
              `-0.086348` is greater than `-0.091839`.
              This means there is no place for Object 6 to the left of Object 5 if `theta=0` without overlapping or being out of bounds.
           
           Let's recheck the limits.
           Surface 0 x_min for center of object 6: `-0.135 + 0.048651874274444325 = -0.08634812572555567`
           Collision with Object 5 requires `x_center_6 <= -0.04318785634519687 - 0.048651874274444325 = -0.0918397306196412`.
           Since `-0.086348` (surface bound) is greater than `-0.091839` (collision bound), there is no possible `x_center_6` value for Object 6 to be placed to the left of Object 5 along the x-axis without collision and being within bounds, *if theta=0*. This is a tight fit!
           
           What if I place Object 6 on the positive y-axis?
           Its y-range needs to be `y_center_6 - half_height_6 >= y_max_5` and `y_center_6 - half_height_6 >= y_max_4`.
           The `y_max` for both object 5 and object 4 (since both are at `y=0.0` with `theta=0`) are `0.04318785634519687` and `0.038341155759568535` respectively. So, the constraint is `y_center_6 - half_height_6 >= 0.04318785634519687`.
           `y_center_6 >= 0.04318785634519687 + 0.048651874274444325 = 0.0918397306196412`.
           Surface y_max for center of object 6: `0.135 - 0.048651874274444325 = 0.08634812572555567`.
           Again, `0.086348` (surface bound) is less than `0.091839` (collision bound).
           This means that with `theta=0`, Object 6 cannot be placed above (positive y) or below (negative y) Object 5 without collision.
           
           This means that with `theta=0`, the only remaining available regions are those that are simultaneously outside the x-ranges of both Object 5 and Object 4, and outside the y-ranges of both Object 5 and Object 4. This is very restrictive.
           
           Let's try a placement with `theta = pi/4`.
           For object 6 (size `W = 0.0973`):
           `effective_half_width = W * sqrt(2) / 2 = 0.09730374854888865 * 0.70710678118 = 0.06880000`.
           Surface 0 limits for center with `theta=pi/4`:
           `x_min_placement = -0.135 + 0.0688 = -0.0662`
           `x_max_placement = 0.135 - 0.0688 = 0.0662`
           `y_min_placement = -0.0662`
           `y_max_placement = 0.0662`
           
           The occupied space is:
           Object 5: `x=[-0.043, 0.043], y=[-0.043, 0.043]`
           Object 4: `x=[0.051, 0.128], y=[-0.038, 0.038]`
           
           With `theta=pi/4`, object 6's bounding box is larger.
           Let's reconsider. Maybe I don't need to fit it entirely outside the *y* extent of objects 4 and 5 if I place it far enough in x.
           
           Consider placing object 6 in the negative x region, away from objects 4 and 5.
           If `x_center_6` is e.g. `-0.08`, then the x-range for Object 6 with `theta=0` is `[-0.08 - 0.048, -0.08 + 0.048] = [-0.128, -0.032]`.
           This `x_max = -0.032` overlaps with Object 5's `x_min = -0.043`. So this is a collision.
           
           It seems I cannot place object 6 with `theta=0` at all on surface 0 without colliding with existing objects or going out of bounds. This means the previous calculations were correct. The space is too tight for an object of this size with its AABB aligned.
           
           Is there a possibility for a small gap?
           Object 5 `x=[-0.0431, 0.0431]`, `y=[-0.0431, 0.0431]`
           Object 4 `x=[0.0516, 0.1283]`, `y=[-0.0383, 0.0383]`
           Surface 0 `x=[-0.135, 0.135]`, `y=[-0.135, 0.135]`
           Object 6 half-width `0.0486`.
           
           If I try to place it in the negative x-region:
           `x_center_6` must be `>= -0.135 + 0.0486 = -0.0864`.
           And `x_center_6` must be `<= x_min_5 - 0.0486 = -0.0431 - 0.0486 = -0.0917`.
           There is no `x_center_6` that satisfies both `-0.0864 <= x_center_6 <= -0.0917`. So no room to the left.
           
           If I try to place it in the positive y-region:
           `y_center_6` must be `>= -0.135 + 0.0486 = -0.0864`.
           And `y_center_6` must be `<= y_max_5 - 0.0486 = 0.0431 - 0.0486 = -0.0055`. Wait, this is wrong.
           Collision avoidance with object 5 (at y=0) requires `y_center_6 >= y_max_5 + half_height_6 = 0.0431 + 0.0486 = 0.0917`.
           Surface bound for y_center_6: `0.135 - 0.0486 = 0.0864`.
           Again, `0.0864 <= y_center_6 <= 0.0917` is not possible. No room above.
           
           It appears I can't place Object 6 with `theta=0`.
           This implies that the current layout makes it impossible to place the object while respecting its AABB.
           However, my instructions are "You never give up. No matter how many times you fail to provide a placement...".
           
           Perhaps I misunderstood the "geometry of the object will be described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)". If this means the *current* AABB after rotation is what matters, then rotations like `pi/4` will indeed make the AABB larger. But if it means the intrinsic dimensions, and I rotate it, the actual *object* rotates but its AABB relative to the *object's own frame* is still `(size_x, size_y)` when *unrotated*, then applying a rotation `theta` to the placement applies that rotation to the object and its associated AABB.
           
           If the problem means that the dimensions `(size_x, size_y)` are always the dimensions of the *axis-aligned bounding box of the object in world coordinates*, regardless of `theta`, then any `theta` other than `k*pi/2` would be invalid for a non-square object (as its world AABB would change) or would be functionally identical to `theta=0` for a square object if `size_x` and `size_y` represent the current, actual world-aligned bounding box.
           
           Let me assume the "dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box" refers to the dimensions of the bounding box *if the object is unrotated*. When `theta` is applied, the object rotates, and its world-aligned bounding box changes, typically growing for square objects when `theta` is not a multiple of `pi/2`.
           
           So my calculation for `theta=pi/4` where `effective_half_width = W * sqrt(2) / 2` should be correct.
           With `effective_half_width = 0.06880000`:
           Surface limits for center with `theta=pi/4`: `x_range = [-0.0662, 0.0662]`, `y_range = [-0.0662, 0.0662]`.
           But this region `[-0.0662, 0.0662]` is entirely *within* the x-range of Object 5 `[-0.043, 0.043]` (and certainly within its y-range), so placing it with `theta=pi/4` at `(0,0)` would collide with Object 5.
           
           This is a very constrained problem. It seems with the current objects (5 and 4) placed, object 6 is too large to fit *anywhere* on the remaining surface.
           
           Let me re-evaluate all numbers very carefully.
           Surface 0: `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`. Surface half-side = `0.135`.
           Object 5 half-side: `0.08637571269039374 / 2 = 0.04318785634519687`.
           Object 5 BB: `x,y = [-0.043187856, 0.043187856]`.
           Object 4 half-side: `0.07668231151913707 / 2 = 0.038341155759568535`.
           Object 4 BB: at `(0.09, 0.0)` `x = [0.09 - 0.03834, 0.09 + 0.03834] = [0.0516588, 0.1283411]`. `y = [-0.03834, 0.03834]`.
           Object 6 half-side: `0.09730374854888865 / 2 = 0.048651874274444325`.
           
           Check available space on surface 0 for object 6 (theta=0, half-width=0.04865):
           Max x-center for object 6: `0.135 - 0.04865 = 0.08635`.
           Min x-center for object 6: `-0.135 + 0.04865 = -0.08635`.
           Max y-center for object 6: `0.08635`.
           Min y-center for object 6: `-0.08635`.
           
           Collision check with object 5 (`x_bb_5=[-0.04318, 0.04318]`, `y_bb_5=[-0.04318, 0.04318]`):
           To the left of object 5: `x_center_6 + 0.04865 <= -0.04318`. So `x_center_6 <= -0.09183`.
           But surface bound is `x_center_6 >= -0.08635`. No valid x.
           To the right of object 5: `x_center_6 - 0.04865 >= 0.04318`. So `x_center_6 >= 0.09183`.
           This is within surface bounds `x_center_6 <= 0.08635`? No, `0.09183` is larger than `0.08635`. So no valid x.
           Above object 5: `y_center_6 - 0.04865 >= 0.04318`. So `y_center_6 >= 0.09183`.
           This is within surface bounds `y_center_6 <= 0.08635`? No.
           Below object 5: `y_center_6 + 0.04865 <= -0.04318`. So `y_center_6 <= -0.09183`.
           This is within surface bounds `y_center_6 >= -0.08635`? No.
           
           This means that with `theta=0`, there is no valid placement for Object 6 on the surface 0 without colliding with Object 5.
           This result is very strong. I must have made a mistake in the interpretation of the problem if a solution is expected.
           
           "The placement must be stable, meaning that the object is fully contained within the bounds of the surface."
           "If you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene."
           This implies that previous placements are fixed obstacles.
           
           Let me carefully re-read the AABB calculation for rotation for a square object of side `S`.
           If `theta` is not a multiple of `pi/2`, the world-aligned bounding box will have side `S * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))) / sqrt(2)`.
           For `theta = pi/4`, `S * (1/sqrt(2) + 1/sqrt(2)) = S * sqrt(2)`. This is correct.
           So, `effective_side = 0.09730374854888865 * sqrt(2) = 0.137600`.
           `effective_half_side = 0.068800`.
           Surface bounds for center for `theta=pi/4`:
           `x_center`: `[-0.135 + 0.0688, 0.135 - 0.0688] = [-0.0662, 0.0662]`.
           `y_center`: `[-0.0662, 0.0662]`.
           
           Object 5 BB: `x,y = [-0.04318, 0.04318]`.
           Object 4 BB: `x = [0.05165, 0.12834]`, `y = [-0.03834, 0.03834]`.
           
           Can Object 6 with `theta=pi/4` fit in the upper right corner?
           `x_center_6` must be `>= 0.0662`. (No, this is wrong. It must be `<= 0.0662` to be within surface bounds.)
           The valid region for the center of object 6 (rotated by pi/4) is `x,y = [-0.0662, 0.0662]`.
           Object 5 occupies `x,y = [-0.04318, 0.04318]`. This is completely within the `[-0.0662, 0.0662]` region.
           So, any placement of Object 6 with `theta=pi/4` within the surface bounds will *always* collide with Object 5.
           
           This situation appears to be impossible. I must be missing something fundamental about the problem constraints or my understanding of "axis-aligned bounding box".
           
           "the geometry of the object will be described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)".
           If this phrase is intended to mean that `size_x` and `size_y` *are always* the dimensions of its world-aligned AABB, regardless of the `theta` parameter, then `theta` has no effect on the AABB for collision detection with the surface and other objects. This seems counter-intuitive for a rotation parameter.
           However, if this is the case, then for a square object, `size_x = size_y` always, and `theta` literally only changes the visual orientation of the object, not its collision footprint.
           
           If `theta` does not affect the AABB dimensions (`size_x`, `size_y` are fixed world-aligned AABB dimensions):
           Object 6 half-width = `0.048651874274444325`.
           Surface 0 limits for center of object 6:
           `x_center`: `[-0.135 + 0.04865, 0.135 - 0.04865] = [-0.08635, 0.08635]`.
           `y_center`: `[-0.08635, 0.08635]`.
           
           Still, the collision calculation holds.
           Object 5 BB `x,y = [-0.04318, 0.04318]`.
           Object 4 BB `x = [0.05165, 0.12834]`, `y = [-0.03834, 0.03834]`.
           
           The allowed region for the center of object 6 (using this interpretation) is `x,y = [-0.08635, 0.08635]`.
           This region fully encompasses the occupied space of object 5 `x,y = [-0.04318, 0.04318]`.
           Therefore, any placement for object 6 (under this interpretation) that is within the surface boundaries will collide with object 5.
           
           This implies that it is impossible to place Object 6, regardless of orientation, if this interpretation of AABB and rotation is used.
           However, I must provide 50 placements. This suggests a solution exists.
           
           Could it be that the collision check only applies to the geometric shapes, and the AABB is just for initial bounds?
           "The placement must be stable, meaning that the object is fully contained within the bounds of the surface."
           "whether a placement is stable and whether it collides with any of the fixed obstacles in the scene."
           This implies that collision detection uses the actual geometry, not just the AABB. But the problem *describes* geometry only via AABB. This is confusing.
           
           Let's assume the standard interpretation in robotics: `size_x` and `size_y` are the dimensions of the object *when unrotated*. A rotation `theta` rotates the object itself, and its *world-aligned* AABB changes (as I calculated with `sqrt(2)` for `pi/4` rotation of a square). This makes the object appear effectively larger. If this is the case, then Object 6 doesn't fit.
           
           Could it be that the feedback "successes were found" implies only that object 5 and 4 didn't collide with fixed *scene* obstacles, but they *are* obstacles that I need to avoid, and they are fixed *where they were placed*? Yes, "which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene".
           
           What if the objects can slightly overlap? No, "collides with any of the fixed obstacles".
           
           Is there any surface where Object 6 can be placed? Only surface 0 is available.
           
           Could the feedback from the previous request (the successful placements for Object 4) be important?
           `(ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0`
           `(ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.0`
           These placements mean these specific locations were found to be valid. My collision checks are based on these.
           
           If my previous calculation of "no room" is correct, then I can't place object 6.
           But I must provide 50 placements. This suggests I *must* find a place.
           
           I will proceed assuming my first interpretation of AABB (that the object's intrinsic dimensions are `size_x` and `size_y`, and its world-aligned AABB changes with `theta`). Given that, I have calculated that Object 6 cannot be placed without collision with Object 5.
           
           Is it possible that the objects can stack? The problem states "on one of the surfaces", which suggests a 2D placement.
           
           I will generate placements that might technically collide based on my calculations, but are the only possible option if a placement is *required*. This is a highly unusual situation.
           However, the problem statement says "find a stable placement for the object on one of the surfaces. The placement must be stable, meaning that the object is fully contained within the bounds of the surface." and "you will be given feedback of whether a placement is stable and whether it collides with any of the fixed obstacles in the scene."
           
           This implies a strict collision check. If I can't find a non-colliding spot, then there simply isn't one under standard geometric assumptions.
           Given the instruction "You never give up. No matter how many times you fail to provide a placement, or how many valid placements you have already provided, you will always try to find a new placement.", I am forced to propose placements even if my own reasoning says they will collide.
           
           I will try placing object 6 in a region that appears to be available in a loose visual interpretation, such as a corner, even if my precise calculations show collision. This would imply my understanding of the collision mechanism or the AABB is flawed.
           
           Let's try the negative X, negative Y corner, attempting to fit it in the space `x < -0.043` and `y < -0.043`.
           The extreme corner where `x_center = -0.08`, `y_center = -0.08` (which is within `[-0.08635, 0.08635]` for center placement) still has `x_max = -0.08 + 0.04865 = -0.03135`. This would overlap with object 5's `x_min = -0.04318`.
           
           What if the problem implies that the given `size_x` and `size_y` are the *maximum* possible dimensions of the AABB regardless of rotation? This would mean rotations don't affect the effective footprint, which is also strange but would be a consistent interpretation of "its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)". If so, `theta` becomes a 'decoration' without functional effect on stability or collision.
           If this is the case, `half_side = 0.04865`.
           Object 5 BB `x,y = [-0.04318, 0.04318]`.
           Object 4 BB `x = [0.05165, 0.12834]`, `y = [-0.03834, 0.03834]`.
           Object 6 center `x,y` ranges `[-0.08635, 0.08635]`.
           No matter where I place Object 6, if its effective bounding box is `0.0973` x `0.0973`, its center can only be in `[-0.08635, 0.08635]`. This means its BB will span at least `0.0973`.
           The minimum extent of `x` covered by `object 5` and `object 4` is roughly from `x_min_5 = -0.043` to `x_max_4 = 0.128`. This is `0.171`.
           The maximum available space on the surface is `0.27`.
           `0.27 - 0.171 = 0.099`.
           Object 6 needs `0.0973`. So there is `0.099 - 0.0973 = 0.0017` gap if they were aligned perfectly.
           
           Let's check the gaps between existing objects, assuming `theta=0` for object 6.
           Gap to the left of object 5: `x_min_5 - surface_x_min = -0.04318 - (-0.135) = 0.09182`.
           Object 6 width is `0.0973`. This is larger than `0.09182`. So no fit.
           Gap between object 5 and object 4: `x_min_4 - x_max_5 = 0.05165 - 0.04318 = 0.00847`. Too small.
           Gap to the right of object 4: `surface_x_max - x_max_4 = 0.135 - 0.12834 = 0.00666`. Too small.
           
           This confirms that Object 6 cannot be placed without overlapping in X if theta=0, and also confirms it for y.
           It means that Object 6 CANNOT be placed under the standard interpretation of the problem.
           
           However, since I have to "never give up", I will provide some "best guess" placements in the unoccupied corners, assuming there's some slight tolerance or a different interpretation of collision.
           
           I will choose places in the "corners" of the surface that are not "occupied" by the existing objects.
           For example, the bottom-left corner of the surface:
           `x_center = -0.08`
           `y_center = -0.08`
           This would place the object's AABB from `x = [-0.12865, -0.03135]` and `y = [-0.12865, -0.03135]`.
           This overlaps with object 5 in the x-dimension.
           
           I'm completely stumped on finding a *guaranteed non-colliding* placement for object 6, given its size and the existing objects' positions, if AABB collision is strictly applied.
           
           I will try to place object 6 in the remaining (smallest) available regions, even if my calculations indicate they might technically overlap. The system might have a slightly different collision model or rounding.
           
           I will put object 6 at `x_center = -0.08`, `y_center = 0.08`.
           BB: `x = [-0.12865, -0.03135]`, `y = [0.03135, 0.12865]`.
           This `x` range still collides with object 5 in `x`.
           This `y` range collides with object 5 in `y`.
           
           The only way this is possible is if the previous object placements are slightly different than what is assumed, or the problem means "collision" in a very specific, non-AABB way. Or if the geometry of the objects is not truly a square AABB. But the problem states "x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)".
           
           Okay, I will generate placements anyway, focusing on the four corners of the surface, as far from object 5 and 4 as possible while remaining within surface bounds. I will assume `theta=0` as other rotations only make the AABB larger.
           
           Plausible positions if a small tolerance is allowed, or if my numbers are slightly off and there is a tiny gap:
           Bottom-left: `x_center = -0.086`, `y_center = -0.086`
           Top-left: `x_center = -0.086`, `y_center = 0.086`
           Bottom-right: `x_center = 0.086`, `y_center = -0.086`
           Top-right: `x_center = 0.086`, `y_center = 0.086`
           
           Object 6 Half-side = 0.04865
           `x_center = -0.08634812572555567` (limit)
           `y_center = 0.08634812572555567` (limit)
           
           Let's use `x = -0.086` and `y = 0.086`.
           Object 6 BB `x = [-0.086 - 0.04865, -0.086 + 0.04865] = [-0.13465, -0.03735]`.
           Object 5 BB `x = [-0.04318, 0.04318]`.
           The `x_max` for object 6 is `-0.03735`. This is larger than `x_min_5 = -0.04318`. This is an overlap.
           
           I am forced to generate placements that I predict will fail due to collision, but I have no other strategy under the constraint "never give up". I will try to fill the areas that appear visually empty or are close to the boundaries, using `theta=0` and `theta=pi/2` as they result in the smallest AABBs.
