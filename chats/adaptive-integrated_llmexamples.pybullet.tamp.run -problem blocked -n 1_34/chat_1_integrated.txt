           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.457, 0.077, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.835, 0.55).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.503, 0.031), (-4.411, 0.123)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which is equivalent to `on(green, v18)` and `type(green, v17)`. In the initial state, `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)` indicate that `v8` and `v12` could be the `green` object. We also have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`, which means that both `v8` and `v12` can be placed on `v18` at pose `#o2`. The only action available is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`.
           
           Looking at the goal condition `on(?green, v18)`, it implies that `supported(?green, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(?green, ?p)` must be true.
           We have `type(v8, v17)` in the initial state, so `v8` can be the `green` object. We also have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`.
           The initial state already has `atpose(v8, v9)`. If we can pick `v8` from `v9` and place it at `#o2` on `v18`, we can achieve the goal.
           
           However, the only allowed action is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. This action doesn't change the state of objects or their poses, nor does it affect `on` predicates. It only changes `atbconf` and `canmove`. Therefore, we cannot pick and place any objects to achieve `on(?green, v18)`. Since the initial state does not satisfy `on(?green, v18)` for any object that is `type(?green, v17)` (i.e. `v8` or `v12`), the goal cannot be achieved with the given actions.
