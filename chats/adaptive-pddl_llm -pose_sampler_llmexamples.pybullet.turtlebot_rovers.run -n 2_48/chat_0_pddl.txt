User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with dimensions 5x5, centered at the origin. There's a vertical wall in the middle (object 5) at x=0, stretching from y=-2.5 to y=2.5. This effectively divides the room into two smaller 2.5x5 rooms. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the room, including some near the corners and some in the middle. I will try to find positions for the robot that are not too close to the obstacles, and prioritize positions that are closer to the target point.
           
           The target point is (-0.9572621453997184, -0.6387087815243174). Since the target point is in the left half of the room, I will try to keep the robot on the left side of the room as well, to maintain line-of-sight. The max range is 2.
           
           Positions:
           (-0.9572621453997184 -0.6387087815243174)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     My previous attempts were based on a misunderstanding of the target point. The target point in the previous request was actually (2.0127220153808594, 1.8315300941467285), but I used the previous target point from the first request. This time, I will use the correct target point from the current request.
           
           The target point is (2.0127220153808594, 1.8315300941467285). The max range is 2. The target is in the upper right quadrant of the room. There are several obstacles in this region (objects 7, 20). I will try to place the robot close to the target, avoiding the known obstacles and keeping to the right of the central wall (object 5).

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     My apologies, I am still making errors in interpreting the target point. The target point in the previous request was (0.45261096954345703, 1.919647216796875). I will try to be more careful this time.
           
           The new target point is (0.45261096954345703, 1.919647216796875). The max range is 2. This target is in the upper right quadrant, but close to the central wall (object 5). Obstacles 9, 10, and 19 are in this area. My previous attempt (1.0127220153808594, 1.8315300941467285) failed due to no line of sight to the target, which indicates that object 5 or 9 or 19 might be blocking the view. I will try positions that are closer to the target and avoid the known obstacles. I will try to stay on the right side of object 5.
