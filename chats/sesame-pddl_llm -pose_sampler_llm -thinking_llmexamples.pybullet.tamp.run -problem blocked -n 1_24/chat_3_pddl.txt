           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning through the Plan**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to making sure an object is both *on* something and of a specific *type*. I see that this means I need to make `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` true.
           
           Now, I notice that in the initial state, I have `type(v12, v17)`.  Bingo! So, if I can just get `v12` to be "on" something at pose `#o2` and the specific object `v18` with the supported pose, then I can achieve the goal.
           
           The definition of "on" is helpful, as it has two conditions: `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`. And luckily, my initial state includes `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`, which is perfect. All I need now is to get `v12` to be "at" `#o2`.
           
           This is a classic "pick and place" problem. I see that `v12` is initially at pose `v13`. I've got to make my robot, which is `v4`, pick up `v12` from pose `v13` and place it at pose `#o2`.
           
           I see that `kin(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)` is true, meaning the kinematic configuration of this can be solved. I will need to use a `move_base` operation so I can adjust the base configuration if `atbconf(#o3)` is not active or can no longer be used. And so I plan to move the base `v3` to `o3`. This will let me pick up `v12` with grasp `#o1` from pose `v13`. After `v12` has been picked, I will place it to pose `#o2` with the same grasp `#o1`.
           
           Alright, I can see the following actions are needed to get this done: `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`, `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4`, and `place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`. The robot base will need to `move_base` before a `pick` can occur.
           
           The critical thing is to verify preconditions and effects. I must make sure that `atbconf(#o3)` is true before picking, that `v4` is `handempty` and that `atpose(v12, v13)` before picking, and that `atgrasp(v4, v12, #o1)` is true before `place`.  I must also ensure the negative preconditions (like `unsafeapproach` and `unsafepose`) are not present.
           
           The key to the plan's success is getting `v12` into pose `#o2`. Then the initial facts and the derived condition, which are needed for this to function, will be true. After all,  `atpose(v12, #o2)` is needed.
           
           I checked how the effects and states of each action influence the next actions. `move_base` will set `atbconf` true.  `pick` will ensure the robot knows where to move with `move_base`. `place` makes certain that `v12` is actually on that pose `#o2`.
           
           With those, I am pretty sure this plan works to make the goal `new-axiom@0()` true!  The plan appears to have valid preconditions for each action, and the effects will lead me to the goal state.
