           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis and Planning for `new-axiom@0()` in the `pr2-tamp` Domain**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which, as I understand it, translates to having an object that is both *on* something and has a specific *type*. Looking at the initial state, I see that I can use the object `v12` to satisfy this, since it is of type `v17`. My plan then becomes to get `v12` *on* `v18`.
           
           Examining the axioms, I've determined that "on" means `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`.  I can see in the initial state that `v12` is *supported* at pose `#p1` on object `v18`.  Therefore, my focus is now on getting `v12` *at* the pose `#p1`. Currently, `v12` is at pose `v13`.
           
           To accomplish this, I'll need a sequence of actions.  Since the robot's arm, `v4`, is currently empty, I'll need to use these actions:
           1.  **Move Base:** I'll have to maneuver the robot's base to allow the arm to reach the object for picking it up. Since `v12` is at pose `v13`, and to pick and place `v12` at `#p1`, the robot must first move its base to a configuration `q3`.
           2.  **Pick:** Then I'll have the robot's arm `v4` pick up object `v12` from its current pose `v13` because it has the right kinesthetic properties to complete a pick action.
           3.  **Move Base:** Next, I'll need to move the robot base to `#q2`, to prepare for the *place* action because it requires kinesthetic information based on the initial state.
           4.  **Place:** Finally, with the base in position, I'll direct the robot's arm `v4` to place the object `v12` at pose `#p1` on top of object `v18`.
           
           I've ensured that the preconditions for these actions are met, and I've verified that the effects of one action set up the preconditions for the next. The robot's initial configuration at `v3`, allows a move action to the configuration `q3`. Then, picking action can happen because preconditions `handempty`, `atpose`, `kin`, and `atbconf` are met.  Then to place, there will have to be a move base, so `move_base q3 #q2`. The place is valid because the preconditions are met with those of `place`. 
           
           After executing this sequence, `v12` will be at `#p1`. Since `#p1` is supported by `v18`, this directly satisfies the goal `on(v12, v18)`. With `v12` also being of `type v17`, the initial goal is met and `new-axiom@0()` is satisfied.
