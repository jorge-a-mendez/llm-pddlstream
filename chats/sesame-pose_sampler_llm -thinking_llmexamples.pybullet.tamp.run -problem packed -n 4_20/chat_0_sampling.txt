(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've been tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (size: 0.070244 x 0.070244) on a larger square surface (0.27 x 0.27), centered at (0,0). "Stable" means the object must be entirely contained within the surface.  Since this object is a square, rotating it by multiples of 90 degrees doesn't really change its bounding box. However, other rotations will influence the valid placement area.
           
           My approach: first, I'll calculate the bounds of the valid placement area for *any* rotation.  The smallest valid area will be when the object is rotated by 45 degrees,  since this maximizes its effective bounding box.  I find this to be within a range of (-0.085, -0.085) to (0.085, 0.085) for the object's center.
           
           Then, I'll generate a grid of positions within that range, and rotate the square.  First, I generated 6 theta values, and then created (x,y) positions for each one. The grid is small enough that no two objects are in the same place. I will stop once I hit 50 placements. It will ensure that all of the placements are different.
           
           For each rotation I'll calculate the valid x and y bounds using the formula: `h_eff = (L_obj/2) * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This provides the effective half-extents of the rotated object.
           
           The plan is to iterate through these rotation angles and generate several x-y coordinates within the allowed area, and stop when I find 50 unique placements.

(Thoughts: **My Thinking: Placing the New Object**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new request, and I'm ready to tackle it. I've got a placed object from a previous request (Object ID: 5), which is now positioned at the origin, with a specific rotation and dimensions (L5).  Its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) is defined, which is important for collision detection.
           
           Now, I need to place a new, square object (ID: 7).  I've got its dimensions (L7) and I need to find 50 stable placements on surface 0, while avoiding any collisions with the existing object. The surface's boundaries are also defined.
           
           I'm going to follow a similar strategy I've used before.  First, I'll iterate through a range of rotation angles (theta) and for each one, I'll calculate the *effective* half-extents (h_eff) of object 7, which change depending on the rotation.  I've calculated them for specific angles and understand how to compute them generally. I know that for different rotations I have different h_eff values. The maximum and minimum values of the half extents were calulated. Then I'll adjust the range for valid (x,y) positions for that specific rotation, considering the object's dimensions and the surface limits, and I'll calculate the allowed ranges for x and y to fit inside the surface.
           
           To avoid collisions, I'll need to check if the new object's AABB overlaps with object 5's AABB. I've got the collision condition formulated: if the AABBs overlap, there's a collision. I've worked out the collision check by calculating the AABB of the new object given its position and rotation, and comparing it to the known AABB of object 5.
           
           After testing the range, I'm going to generate the appropriate coordinates for generating an initial list of placements. I'll test some values of rotation and valid placements. I'll then generate candidate (x, y) positions within the valid ranges, and for each position, I'll perform the collision check. If there's no collision and if the placement is stable, I'll add that specific valid placement to the list. I've found a sampling strategy that generates a decent spread of positions while minimizing the computational cost.
           
           After the initial checks and calculations, I found a collision in a specific placement with specific rotation, and have refined the strategy to have accurate checks to generate the correct amount of positions, while avoiding placing the objects too closely to each other.
           
           To efficiently find 50 stable placements, I will combine the knowledge gained from the previous attempts with the geometry information, which included the different rotation possibilities and placement areas, which allowed me to refine my sampling and collision checks, for efficiency.
           
           I've generated a set of candidate placements that covers various positions and rotations and have now the set of valid placements.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for a New Object**
           
           I need to figure out where to place this new object, ID 4, on surface 0, making sure I get 50 stable positions.  The catch? I have to avoid collisions with the two existing objects, IDs 5 and 7, already sitting on the surface.
           
           First, I define the surface: it’s a square region. Then, I gather the details about object 5 and object 7: their sizes, exact placements (x and y, along with a rotation angle), and calculate their AABB, or Axis-Aligned Bounding Box, which is the smallest rectangle that completely encloses them. This gives me a quick way to see if there’s a collision.
           
           Since the new object is also a square, the effective half-extents will change based on its rotation; I will need to consider the changes. The strategy is straightforward:
           1. I calculate the effective half-extents (h_eff) of object 4 for different rotation angles. I calculate for both theta=0 and pi/4, because these give me the extreme cases.
           2. The bounds of valid x and y positions for the new object.
           3. Generating a grid to scan for candidate positions (5x5, maybe).
           4. For each potential spot, I construct the new object's AABB for comparison.
           5. I check for collisions with the AABBs of objects 5 and 7.
           6. The objective is to collect as many non-colliding and stable positions as possible (50).
           
           In order to simplify the calculations, I calculate the `h_eff` values for `theta=0` which result in `h_eff = 0.042276`. This helps me define the range of the x and y coordinates in the 2D plane: which end up in `[-0.092723, 0.092723]`.
           I will generate a grid with 5 points in x and 5 points in y, leading to 25 combinations of coordinates. I will then test the collision with Obj5 and Obj7 for all combinations.
           
           I will iterate 8 steps in theta and then, I will perform this same computation on different theta.
           
           My code will generate those values and iterate on them. So, in the end, I will have a robust method for computing 50 solutions for the new object's placements, at different rotations, avoiding any intersection.

(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements for a New Object**
           
           My task is to find 50 stable placements for a new object (ID: 6) on the given surface `0`, while avoiding collisions with three previously placed objects (ID: 5, ID: 7, and ID: 4). The surface is defined by an AABB from `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           
           I've carefully analyzed the dimensions and positions of the existing objects, calculating their AABBs to use in collision detection. The new object is nearly a square.  My strategy is to utilize a combination of rotations and a grid search to efficiently identify valid placements.
           
           To accommodate different orientations, I'll consider eight rotation angles (0, π/4, π/2, 3π/4, π, 5π/4, 3π/2, and 7π/4). For each rotation, I've determined the effective half-extents of the new object's AABB (`h_eff`) based on its dimensions and the rotation angle.  I've created a 7x7 grid within the surface boundaries, ensuring that the new object's center point is far enough away from the surface edges based on the `h_eff`.  For the different rotation angles, I need to adjust the grid size and bounds.
           
           The critical step is the collision check. For each candidate placement (rotation, x, y), I'll calculate the new object's AABB and compare it with the AABBs of the existing objects. I have a robust collision detection algorithm using comparisons between the ranges of the X and Y coordinates.
           
           I need to avoid the negative X/Y corner where Obj 7 resides and ensure I do not collide with Obj 5. I will make sure the calculations are correct for each AABB to avoid errors.
           
           I will iterate through all possible locations and generate the valid placements. The process will be repeated until 50 valid placements are generated.
