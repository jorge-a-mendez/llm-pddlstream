(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for object ID 4 on a specific square surface.  The object is practically a square itself (dimensions: 0.099 x 0.099, approximately), and the surface is a 0.27 x 0.27 square centered at the origin. My approach is to ensure the object is *fully* within the surface bounds for each placement.
           
           First, I identified the key constraint: the object's center coordinates (x, y) must be adjusted based on the object's *effective* size after rotation (theta). I determined that for the object's bounding box after rotation, the effective width and height can be calculated using trigonometric functions with *w* and *h* as the original dimensions. Since the dimensions are so close, the effective dimensions don't change drastically with the angle. The tightest bound occurs when the object is rotated by 45 degrees.
           
           The surface bounds are simple: x and y between -0.135 and 0.135.  I determined the maximum and minimum x/y values allowed for the center based on the *rotated* effective width and height, by using the 45-degree angle. From that, I determined that, no matter the angle of rotation, the center must fall within a range of approximately -0.065 to 0.065 for both x and y.
           
           To ensure diversity, I picked a few representative angles. I started with a grid-like arrangement for angles of 0, 45, and 90 degrees, picking a few points within the safe x-y range. I picked the grid to cover the full space with those 0, 45, and 90 rotations. I also included the 30- and 60-degree rotations, where I centered a few points. The rest I generated randomly.
           
           To generate 50 valid placements, I used an efficient mixed approach:
           1.  **Systematic Placements (37):**
               *   Nine placements for angles 0 and 90 degrees using a 3x3 grid centered in the tight x, y coordinates to have full overlap (which gave the same effective bounding dimensions).
               *   Nine placements for the 45-degree angle in the more restricted x, y region using a 3x3 grid.
               *   Five placements for the 30 and 60-degree angles in the more restricted x, y region using an overlapping set of coordinates.
           2.  **Random Placements (13):**  I generated 13 random angles and x, y values within the same safe range, ensuring they'd be fully inside the surface even after rotation.
           
           This ensures a diverse set of valid and stable placements while respecting the physical constraints. The chosen approach leverages the symmetry of the problem to reduce calculation.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Finding 50 Stable Positions**
           
           I've been tasked with placing Object 8, a square of size 0.08558, onto a surface. My goal is to find 50 stable positions for it, ensuring it doesn't collide with Object 4, which is already placed.  It's positioned at `(surf_idx=0, theta=0.0, x=-0.07, y=-0.07)` and has an AABB defined by the coordinates `[-0.119, -0.020] x [-0.119, -0.020]`.
           
           The surface is defined as `[-0.135, 0.135] x [-0.135, 0.135]`.  
           
           To find these placements, I'm first calculating the maximum and minimum extents of Object 8 for various rotations, especially using a test of angle variations.  These help to inform a systematic grid generation.  I'm using a grid to cover the possible center points, then carefully filtering them.
           
           I identified the forbidden zone where Object 8 would collide with Object 4.  By looking at how the Object 8's bounding box changes for various angles, I will generate a set of test points, then assess each for collision.  I then apply several heuristics:
           *   I will test some points near the borders of the surface.
           *   I make sure the points aren't too near the zone of conflict.
           
           In addition to the calculated points, I also generate some random positions to ensure a diverse set of results, making certain they don't collide with Object 4. I also check for duplicate entries that are unlikely but possible.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for a New Object**
           
           Okay, I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on Surface 0, taking into account existing objects: ID 4 and ID 8. My initial strategy involves calculating the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) for each object and ensuring new placements don't collide.
           
           First, I analyze Surface 0, which has the bounds of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  Then, I consider object 5, which is roughly square with dimensions of about 0.098945.
           
           Next, I need to understand the constraints imposed by the two pre-existing objects. Object 4 is centered at (-0.07, -0.07) and has dimensions of about 0.098973. Object 8 is centered at (0.05, 0.05) and has dimensions of about 0.085583. Using this info, I can determine the safe zones for object 5.
           
           The main challenge is to ensure that the new object (ID 5) fits within the surface bounds, avoids collisions with the other objects, and, if it can, covers as much space as possible. Rotations complicate things a little since each rotation slightly changes the safe area, but using the calculated half-extents, I can work out a safe central range of (-0.065, 0.065) for each x and y.
           
           So, I will generate a grid of potential placements, focusing on x and y coordinates that are away from the other objects in the top-left, bottom-right and general central area. I'll test rotations using different theta values. I will check for collision.

(Thoughts: **Placement Plan for Object 7 on Surface 0**
           
           I've been tasked with finding 50 stable and collision-free placements for Object 7 (a nearly square block with side s7 = 0.0797) on Surface 0, which is a square region centered at the origin, ranging from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). The critical part is that I need to avoid any collisions with the existing objects on the surface: Object 4, Object 8, and Object 5.  These are also squares, placed at fixed locations on the surface.
           
           To tackle this, my strategy revolves around systematically checking potential placement locations (x, y coordinates of Object 7's center) for various rotations (theta).  I'll generate AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) for both existing and prospective placements to efficiently detect collisions.
           
           First, I define the AABBs for the existing objects. This will be a one-time calculation as these placements are static. I know Object 4 is in the bottom-left, Object 8 in the top-right, and Object 5 in the top-left quadrant. Their AABBs are calculated using their position, dimensions and the fact that their rotation is zero.
           
           Then, I'll iterate through a set of rotation angles `theta` ranging from 0 to 2*pi, with reasonable steps like pi/8.  For each `theta`, I'll calculate the *effective* width/height `hew7` and `heh7` for the rotating square Object 7.  The absolute range for acceptable center placements depends on this value. Because Object 7 is small, a center point range of -0.07 to 0.07 on both the x and y axes will be enough to ensure that Object 7 is contained within Surface 0.
           
           Now, for each `theta`, I'll iterate through a grid of x and y coordinates, focusing on the available space. I've noted that the bottom-right quadrant of Surface 0 is largely clear, as is a narrow center strip. My search grid for x will range from -0.07 to 0.07, and similarly for y.  I'll ensure I check that each proposed placement is within the surface boundaries.
           
           The core of the logic is collision detection: For each placement (x, y, theta), I construct Object 7's AABB and check for overlaps with the AABBs of Object 4, 8, and 5. I will continue to increment and refine my candidate position (x,y) until I have found 50 valid placements.
           
           In essence, I'm performing a comprehensive, collision-aware grid search to identify stable and acceptable placements for the new object. The calculations are based on the object's dimensions and positions. I will iterate through all possible rotations and placement coordinates to make sure the placements are valid.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement on Surface 0: A Detailed Strategy**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for a new object (ID: 6) on Surface 0, which is defined as `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  This will involve navigating the existing objects (IDs: 4, 8, 5, and 7) and their associated Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) to avoid any collisions.
           
           I've already meticulously calculated the AABBs for each of the existing objects, taking into account their placement coordinates and extents. This information is crucial for collision detection. Object 4 resides in the bottom-left corner, Object 8 in the top-right, Object 5 in the top-left, and Object 7 is centered.  I've visualized these placements, recognizing that this surface is becoming quite crowded.
           
           The new object (ID: 6) has extents of `(w6=0.0932, h6=0.0932)`, making it nearly square.  To determine suitable locations, I'll employ a systematic approach:
           
           1.  **Surface Containment:**  Given the object's extents, a maximum rotated half-extent (`hew6`, `heh6`) is `0.0659` which constrains the valid object centers. It means valid `x` and `y` must fall within `[-0.069, 0.069]`.
           
           2.  **Collision Avoidance:**  The core strategy involves a thorough collision check for each potential placement.  I'll iterate through `theta` (rotation angle) from `0` to `2π` in increments of `π/8`.  Then, I'll explore a grid of `x` and `y` coordinates, ranging from -0.06 to 0.06 in steps of 0.01. For each `(theta, x, y)` combination, I'll construct the object's AABB and check for overlaps with the AABBs of objects 4, 8, 5, and 7. If no collision is detected, I've found a valid placement.
           
           Given the existing objects and their positions, the available space is fragmented, so a robust collision test is essential. It's becoming evident that finding 50 unique placements will be a challenge, so a complete and accurate search is required.

Model:     **Object Placement on Surface 0: A Detailed Strategy**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for a new object (ID: 6) on Surface 0, which is defined as `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  This will involve navigating the existing objects (IDs: 4, 8, 5, and 7) and their associated Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) to avoid any collisions.
           
           I've already meticulously calculated the AABBs for each of the existing objects, taking into account their placement coordinates and extents. This information is crucial for collision detection. Object 4 resides in the bottom-left corner, Object 8 in the top-right, Object 5 in the top-left, and Object 7 is centered.  I've visualized these placements, recognizing that this surface is becoming quite crowded.
           
           The new object (ID: 6) has extents of `(w6=0.0932, h6=0.0932)`, making it nearly square.  To determine suitable locations, I'll employ a systematic approach:
