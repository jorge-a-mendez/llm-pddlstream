           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Revised Plan: A Deep Dive into Mission Execution**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get three images, one stone analysis, and one soil analysis.  The starting point is a bit tricky, and I've had to make some key assumptions to make sense of this.  Here's how I see it:
           
           First, let's break down the `new-axiom@0()` goal. The puzzle boils down to getting pictures of objectives `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`, plus analyses of a rock and some soil.
           
           The initial state is helpful: Two rovers are at their starting locations, `v12` at `v13` and `v14` at `v15`. A camera (`v10`) is on both rovers. There are three stone rocks `v1, v3, v4` and three soil rocks `v5, v7, v8` to analyze. The initial state fact `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` will be key. No explicit moves are allowed, so these rovers will be staying put at their starting points.
           
           **Rover `v14` will get the images:**
           
           To grab the images, I will have to use `calibrate`, `take_image`, and then `send_image`. The `atconf` check for `take_image`  and `calibrate` implies that the rover must be `atconf(v14, X)` *before* each image.  This will be the key constraint.
           
           1.  To get the picture of `v19`,  `calibrate(v14, #o3, #o4, v19, v10)` then `take_image(v14, #o3, #o4, v19, v10, v11)` and then `send_image(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v19, v11)`
           2.  Repeat step 1 for `v18` and `v17`. The crucial factor is that *one* `#o3` must work for all three.
           
           Since there are no move actions, the `#o3` is set to  `v15` for `v14` during imaging.
           The #o3 should be within the range of the targets, so an example location to pick is 0.3, 0.0.
           
           Rover `v12` (staying put at v13) gets to analyze rocks.
           
           1.  `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v3, v16)`
           2.  `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v3)`
           3.  `drop_rock(v12, v16)`
           4.  `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v5, v16)`
           5.  `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v5)`
           
           Because there are no explicit move commands, `#o5` must be the same as `v13`.
           
           **Key Continuous Parameters:**
           
           Here’s where it gets interesting.  Since the prompt says I must define values for the objects used in the plan:
           *   `#o3` (config used by rover v14 during the action `take_image`): (0.3, 0.0) -> This will be the *same* value during actions such as `calibrate v14` for *all* the targets. This is because I'm assuming that #o3 is one valid pose from which all three objectives are within range, and because the *initial facts* in PDDL define `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, ...)` using the SAME `#o3` and `#o4`.
           *   `#o0` (config used by both v14/v12 to send analyses and images): v15 (-1.0,-1.75) for `v14` and v13 (1.0, -1.75) for `v12`
           
           If this plan does not work, it is because I am following PDDL assumptions and interpretations, and the PDDL facts assert that the problem is possible with the given constraints.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of Achieving the Goal**
           
           Okay, I see the problem. The user is right; I messed up. I didn't stick to the allowed action *instances*. I was given a very specific set of moves and drops: `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`, `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`, `(drop_rock v12 v16)`, and `(drop_rock v14 v16)`. And frankly, none of them seem to help me achieve the overarching goal.
           
           The goal, as I unpack it, is to get `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)`, `receivedimage` for three different "somethings" using `v17, v18, v19`, and the same for analysis for two objectives, stone and soil. I've double-checked, and my initial state satisfies the `atconf` and `free` predicates.
           
           But here's the kicker: the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates are all initially false. I need to get them to be true, and I *know* those are the effects of `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, right? The problem is, none of those actions are in my allowed list. The `move` actions just leave the rover in the same configuration, which is pointless. And the `drop_rock` actions... they won't work because `v16` is initially *free*, not full, and there is no way to fill up `v16` in one of the approved moves. I'd need to sample a rock first, but there is no `sample_rock` action.
           
           So, I'm stuck. It's impossible to reach the goal with the given actions. I can't change the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates, no matter what I do with the moves and drops.
