           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **A Strategically Orchestrated Plan**
           
           Okay, here's my line of thinking: I'm staring at this `new-axiom@0()` goal, and it's a bit of a checklist, really. Breaking it down, I see a bunch of preconditions that are already true, and then I have these core tasks: take and send three images, and analyze and send one stone and one soil sample.
           
           First, I identified the players. Two rovers, v12 and v14, each with a camera, store, and the usual suspects of landers and rocks. The initial state gives me a solid starting point – rovers are at known configurations, stores are free. That's good.
           
           Next, I tackled the image-taking first. I noticed both rovers are capable, but v12's initial configuration seems a little easier to manage, so I picked it to make my life simpler (less geometric optimization). To get images, I need to get the rover to the right spot, calibrate the camera, take the picture, and then send it. I realized, though, that the calibration action breaks the calibrated state, so I need to recalibrate each time.
           
           Then, I looked at the image data. I'm seeing three objectives that are not too close together, which means that the configuration #o3 used for `imagevisible` is not the same for each of them. My geometric intuition tells me that I need to be *close* to the objectives. The instruction is telling me I can use multiple configurations and distances of 2. That's the part where I define the values of #o3. So I'm figuring out that I need to "translate" the symbol #o3 to different (x,y) coordinates depending on the objective.
           
           Analyzing the rocks is straightforward - move to the rock, sample it, move to the comms point, send the analysis. However, there's a constraint: the store can only hold one rock at a time, so before I analyze the soil, I have to drop the stone.
           
           The most challenging part of this entire endeavor is interpreting what the initial values of `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` mean, especially concerning the `imagevisible` predicate. Am I expected to find one coordinate set for all? I had to clarify a key point from the instruction to realize that I had to define a (rover, target) pair.
           
           Now, I put it all together. I'm making v12 handle the image and analysis task. All that remains is to pick an object and a number to use for `new-axiom@0()`, which I'll be using for my final output.
           
           I've outlined all the moves I need to execute, the positions I need to move to, and the objects. All these should achieve the goal state. I'm keeping careful track of what each action changes - specifically, the `free`, `full`, and `calibrated` predicates. With that thought, I'm confident that the plan will execute smoothly.

I'm keeping careful track of what each action changes - specifically, the `free`, `full`, and `calibrated` predicates. With that thought, I'm confident that the plan will execute smoothly.

(Thoughts: **Refining the Plan for Successful Operation**
           
           Okay, so I've got a failed plan here, and I need to generate a new, functional one. The core of the problem is collision and reachability, specifically with the continuous configuration values. The previous plan used `v12` to complete all the tasks, which is a good strategy. I'm going to stick with that, as it is efficient. But I need to adjust the continuous values `#o0` and `#o3` to avoid those issues. I've re-reviewed the goal, which is `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunction of various conditions.
           
           The initial state, thankfully, provides helpful starting points, like `atconf`, `free` states. I have the rocks and soil types: `type(?stone, v2)`, `type(?soil, v6)`.  The plan needs to capture images and obtain sample analysis of soil and rock, while still avoiding obstacles.
           
           I need to address two primary obstacles: `v20` (wall at x=0) and `v21` (small box around (0.75, 0.99)). Let's recap the existing plan. The rover `v12` starts at (1.0, -1.75). The plan previously ran into issues around the continuous configuration values for `#o0` and `#o3`.
           
           *   For `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`, the lander is at the center approx (-1.9, -2.0) and rover is at (1.0, -1.75).  I need to reach it.  The collision problem was with the x=0 wall. I am going to try setting `#o0` to `(-0.5, -1.75)`.  This puts me on the other side of the wall. That is about 1.4 units away from `v9`, which is within the 4-unit range, and avoids the collision.
           *   For `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, the objective (`v17`) is approx (0.35, 1.95). The image range is 2. The collision was with unreachable previous coordinates. I'm now setting `#o3` to `(0.35, 1.0)`. This is a vertical distance of around 0.95 from `v17`, which is within range.  It also avoids the wall.
           *   For `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, objective `v18` is approx (-2.18, 2.18). Let's set `#o3` to `(-1.5, 1.0)`. This puts the rover just on the left side of the wall, and the distance is 1.36 to `v18`.
           *   For `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)`, the objective is approx (2.14, 1.8). The box `v21` was a collision problem. Let's try `(1.5, 1.0)`. This is outside the box and about 1.02 units from the target.
           *   Finally for sample points:
               *   I need to sample from `v3` which is a stone near (0.39, -0.25). A good config for `#o5` might be `(0.39, -0.25)`.
               *   I need to sample `v5` which is soil near (-0.35, 0.8). A good config for `#o5` might be `(-0.35, 0.8)`.
           
           So, the plan structure itself looks correct. I'm using the same plan structure. Only the coordinates change to avoid the collisions. The plan must perform image captures and sample analysis while communicating the data back to the base.
           
           The motion primitives are in the existing domain. I verified that the `motion` predicates allow the rover to reach all these new configurations. The plan will be to:
           1.  Move the rover to image capture points (`#o3`).
           2.  Calibrate and Capture images and send them.
           3.  Move to sample points (`#o5`).
           4.  Send analysis to base.
           5.  Move back to the initial config.
           
           I need to make sure the same `#o` variable is used for all instances of that same type. For example, all images must use `#o3`, all comms use `#o0`, and all sample positions use `#

(Thoughts: **Plan Refinement for Rover Task Execution**
           
           Okay, here's the deal: I'm re-evaluating this whole rover pathfinding thing because the initial configs weren't reachable. The core issue is ensuring collision-free paths while meeting visibility constraints, particularly around this `v20` wall at x=0. The main question is can `v12` traverse the wall.
           
           First, I need to come up with new configurations for the rover at the objectives.
           
           Here's the problem: The original attempt considered the rover, `v12`, to only be visible to targets *if it was within range*.
           
           The key insights:
           
           *   **Obstacle Interpretation:** `v20` (a wall at x=0) is likely impassable.  `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)` and `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.  This strongly suggests a plan where `v12` handles positive x-side tasks and `v14` negative x tasks.
           *   **Visibility Logic:** The initial plan's error message mentioned the rover's initial config as *not reachable*.
           *   **Rover Task Split:** I was initially trying to have `v12` be at a single location that could view all, but the visibility ranges and obstacle locations indicate that approach is not correct. I will focus on distinct locations for each of the image objectives. Also, I realized that the prompt stated to use different continuous values for each rover, objective pairs.
           *   **Reachability & Continuous Value:** The key challenge is finding reachable and collision-free positions for the rover while respecting the visibility ranges and ensuring that the *generic* configuration symbol (`#o3`, `#o5`, `#o0`) can be mapped to distinct concrete coordinates for each rover and the target objective. Also, the prompt says the continuous value needs to be collision free, reachable and in line of sight.
           
           The strategy:
           
           1.  **Unique Configurations:** The final strategy is to calculate distinct coordinates.
               *   **Image configs (`#o3`):** Each target (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`) will have a unique `#o3_v12_<target>` configuration calculated to ensure `imagevisible` within the 2-unit range. For example: I calculated `0.35, 0.5` for `v17`.
               *   **Communication config (`#o0`):** The `comvisible` requirement means that I will generate coordinates.
               *   **Above configs (`#o5`):** For analyses, I will compute distinct `above_conf_vX` for each rock `vX` to determine `above`
           
           The revised plan is:
           
           *   Move rover to image locations: For `v17, v18, v19`.
           *   Take image.
           *   Move to lander and send all images.
           *   Sample rock locations.
           *   Move to lander and send analysis for rocks.
           
           To clarify: the plan uses the continuous names. I define concrete locations in a list. The concrete locations will depend on obstacle locations and distance constraints.
           
           I assume `motion` is reachable across, and the concrete path will be computed properly.
           
           The plan *should* now be reachable. If not, I'm out of ideas.

(Thoughts: **My Action Plan for `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` Domain**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan, based on my expert analysis of this challenging `rovers` domain:  I'm facing repeated 'not reachable' errors, which is frustrating.  The goal is multifaceted: get the rovers into the correct final configurations, take those images, and grab analyses of those rocks. I've re-evaluated the setup and think I now have a solid strategy.
           
           The crux of the problem seems to be the wall at x=0. Early on, I thought this barrier would stop rover 12 from completing the mission, but now, I see that the problem description implicitly allows it to happen.  The `comvisible` and `imagevisible` predicates, with their associated "motion" facts, suggest that with the right continuous configurations, I *can* get rover 12 across that wall. So, forget the division of labor between the rovers: I'm putting all my effort into a single, comprehensive plan.
           
           **Rover 12's Mission: Solo Flight**
           
           My revised plan targets all necessary objectives with a single rover (v12) and involves these specific steps:
           
           1.  **Image Targets:** I'll strategically position rover 12 to get clear images of targets (0.306, 1.905), (2.099, 1.758), and (-2.226, 2.147). The "motion" predicates are going to be key here.  I've chosen (0.5, 1.8), (1.5, 1.5), and (-1.5, 2.0) as the continuous positions for the rover to take each image.
           2.  **Communicate:** Rover 12 will then move to (-1.0, -1.0) for clear communication with the lander. The 4-unit communication range is within the range provided.
           3.  **Sample and Analyze:** I'll get the rover above the rock coordinates (0.39, -0.25) and (-0.35, 0.8) to make those soil and stone analyses.
           4.  **Send & Finish:**  Rover 12 will shuttle back and forth between those communication and sample positions, sending images to the lander. My goal here is to do everything and get back into that first (1.0, -1.75) location.
           
           **Key Coordinate Decisions**
           
           I've been meticulous here, accounting for obstacles (like the lander and other barriers).  The main idea is to use that "motion" predicate in the initial state to get me from point A to point B:
           
           *   The challenge is now making sure the path doesn't fail due to specific configurations.
           *   I have tried coordinates that avoid collision by being outside of the rectangles.
           
           **My Theory**
           
           The main challenge is the "not reachable" error message. I'm assuming that it is not caused by the geometry of the situation, but the precise placement of the rover in relation to these continuous configurations.
           
           **Action Instances**
           
           I believe this will execute correctly given the motion predicates and other available actions:
           `move v12 v13 #o2 #o3_v12_v17`
           `move v12 #o3_v12_v17 #o2 #o3_v12_v19`
           `move v12 #o3_v12_v19 #o2 #o3_v12_v18`
           `move v12 #o3_v12_v18 #o2 #o0_v12_v9`
           `move v12 #o0_v12_v9 #o2 #o5_v12_v3`
           `move v12 #o5_v12_v3 #o2 #o0_v12_v9`
           `move v12 #o0_v12_v9 #o2 #o5_v12_v5`
           `move v12 #o5_v12_v5 #o2 #o0_v12_v9`
           `move v12 #o0_v12_v9 #o2 v13`
           
           I believe this plan will achieve the final state.

           The crux of the problem seems to be the wall at x=0. Early on, I thought this barrier would stop rover 12 from completing the mission, but now, I see that the problem description implicitly allows it to happen.  The `comvisible` and `imagevisible` predicates, with their associated "motion" facts, suggest that with the right continuous configurations, I *can* get rover 12 across that wall. So, forget the division of labor between the rovers: I'm putting all my effort into a single, comprehensive plan.
           
           **Rover 12's Mission: Solo Flight**
           
           My revised plan targets all necessary objectives with a single rover (v12) and involves these specific steps:
           
           1.  **Image Targets:** I'll strategically position rover 12 to get clear images of targets (0.306, 1.905), (2.099, 1.758), and (-2.226, 2.147). The "motion" predicates are going to be key here.  I've chosen (0.5, 1.8), (1.5, 1.5), and (-1.5, 2.0) as the continuous positions for the rover to take each image.
           2.  **Communicate:** Rover 12 will then move to (-1.0, -1.0) for clear communication with the lander. The 4-unit communication range is within the range provided.
           3.  **Sample and Analyze:** I'll get the rover above the rock coordinates (0.39, -0.25) and (-0.35, 0.8) to make those soil and stone analyses.
           4.  **Send & Finish:**  Rover 12 will shuttle back and forth between those communication and sample positions, sending images to the lander. My goal here is to do everything and get back into that first (1.0, -1.75) location.
           
           **Key Coordinate Decisions**
           
           I've been meticulous here, accounting for obstacles (like the lander and other barriers).  The main idea is to use that "motion" predicate in the initial state to get me from point A to point B:
           
           *   The challenge is now making sure the path doesn't fail due to specific configurations.
           *   I have tried coordinates that avoid collision by being outside of the rectangles.
           
           **My Theory**
           
           The main challenge is the "not reachable" error message. I'm assuming that it is not caused by the geometry of the situation, but the precise placement of the rover in relation to these continuous configurations.
           
           **Action Instances**
           
           I believe this will execute correctly given the motion predicates and other available actions:
           `move v12 v13 #o2 #o3_v12_v17`
           `move v12 #o3_v12_v17 #o2 #o3_v12_v19`
           `move v12 #o3_v12_v19 #o2 #o3_v12_v18`
           `move v12 #o3_v12_v18 #o2 #o0_v12_v9`
           `move v12 #o0_v12_v9 #o2 #o5_v12_v3`
           `move v12 #o5_v12_v3 #o2 #o0_v12_v9`
           `move v12 #o0_v12_v9 #o2 #o5_v12_v5`
           `move v12 #o5_v12_v5 #o2 #o0_v12_v9`
           `move v12 #o0_v12_v9 #o2 v13`
           
           I believe this plan will achieve the final state.
