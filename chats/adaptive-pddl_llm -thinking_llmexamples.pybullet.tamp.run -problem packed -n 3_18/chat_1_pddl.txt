           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning through the Block-Stacking Puzzle**
           
           Okay, here's how I'm approaching this planning problem. The goal is to stack three blocks, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, all on top of `v16`.  I'm given the initial state, which details the objects, their positions, and what they're currently supporting.  My initial thought is to break down the goal into its components.  "On" means the object is *supported* by another and is *at the correct pose*.
           
           I see that `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are currently on `v11`, each at a different pose (v9, v13, and v15, respectively). They need to move to a common pose, which is labelled `#o2`, on `v16`.  This looks like a straightforward pick-and-place problem, which I'm quite familiar with.
           
           I've checked the preconditions for the `pick` and `place` actions, and the initial state seems to provide everything I need. The key is to make sure the base configuration `#o3` (from the kin facts) is compatible with my current base configuration, which is `v3`. It seems like `#o3` and `v3` can be the same, so there is no need for `move_base`.
           
           The robot has an arm, `v4`, that is currently empty.  I can use the provided `kin` facts to pick each block, one by one.  Then, I can place each block onto `#o2`, which will be on `v16`.
           
           My proposed plan is a sequence of actions:
           1.  **Pick** `v8` from `v9`.
           2.  **Place** `v8` onto `#o2`.
           3.  **Pick** `v12` from `v13`.
           4.  **Place** `v12` onto `#o2`.
           5.  **Pick** `v14` from `v15`.
           6.  **Place** `v14` onto `#o2`.
           
           I am assuming that the planners will correctly determine the relevant grasp (#o1), trajectory(#o4), and base configuration(#o3) given the available knowledge.
           
           This plan should achieve the goal because each block will then be both supported by v16, and in the correct pose.  There seems to be no need to add any other actions.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Impossibility: The Limitation of Allowed Actions**
           
           Okay, so the user's critique is valid. My previous plan was flawed because it included actions that weren't in the *very limited* set of valid actions. I need to be absolutely precise here. The only action allowed is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  That's it.  Let's see where that leaves us.
           
           The goal is pretty clear: get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` *on* `v16`. Specifically,  I need to get them supported *by* `v16`.  The initial state says they are currently supported by `v11`.
           
           To achieve the goal, I need to move these objects from `v11` to `v16`. But here's the kicker: the only allowed action, `move_base`, just gets the robot to a different location. It doesn't allow any object manipulation! There are no `pick` or `place` actions at all.
           
           This realization leads to a stark conclusion. With *only* the `move_base` action, there's no way to interact with the objects at all. I cannot pick them up, move them, or place them. Therefore, moving these objects from `v11` to `v16`, which is the very core of the goal, is *impossible*. The goal is simply unachievable with the provided action instances. I need to clearly state that to the user.
