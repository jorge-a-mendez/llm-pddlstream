           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)

           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom handempty(v6)

           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom supported(v14, v15, v11)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)

           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Goal and Available Actions**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` on top of `v16`. Simple enough, right?  The initial state reveals a few things: all three objects are currently supported by `v11`, specifically at poses `v9`, `v13`, and `v15` respectively.  My arms, `v4` and `v6`, are both handempty, which is a good starting point.  But, here's the kicker: the *only* action I have available is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This move_base action is useless; it's a no-op, since it moves to the same base configuration it already is in.
           
           To achieve my goal, I need to manipulate these objects. Specifically, I need to get each object off `v11` and onto `v16`. That means I need to `pick` them up and `place` them down.  I have several key conditions to satisfy for both, including kinematic constraints (`kin`), base configurations (`atbconf`), and safety checks (`unsafeapproach`, `unsafepose`, etc).
           
           For `pick` and `place`, I need the robot arm to be empty, and I need safe trajectories. For `place`, I need a pose to be safe for placement.  Crucially, I also need to be able to define the right inverse kinematics, which is what the `kin` predicate is for.
           
           However, the action list I'm given *doesn't* include any `pick` or `place` actions.  It's just the useless `move_base`. Given that the instructions specifically state that only available actions can be used, this is a showstopper. The `move_base` action won't change the crucial `atpose` and `supported` predicates that are key to achieving the goal states (i.e., `on(v8,v16)`).
           
           Essentially, I am trying to build a bridge, but I'm only given a single brick that doesn't fit with anything. The goal is provably unachievable with the provided action set. I'm stuck, at least for now.
