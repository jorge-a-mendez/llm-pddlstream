           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.211, -0.116), (0.292, -0.035)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.246, 0.314), (-0.157, 0.403)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.064, 0.245), (0.153, 0.334)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.251, -0.076, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.088, 0.996).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.201, 0.358, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.164, 0.987).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.109, 0.29, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.163, 0.987).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning to Place Objects**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get three objects, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, all onto surface `v16`. Currently, they're sitting on `v11`. The robot has one arm, `v4`, that can do the job.  I see the robot's base is initially at `v3`, and the arm is at configuration `v5`. The key here is the fact that *each* object needs to end up at the same *symbolic* pose, `#o2`, but the *continuous* values for that pose must be distinct for each object. This means I need to figure out three separate x, y, z, and theta values for `#o2` – one for `v8`, one for `v12`, and one for `v14`. I've got to ensure these poses are valid placements on `v16` (collision-free and stable).
           
           The initial plan:
           
           1.  Move the robot's base from `v3` to `(#o3)` so it's ready to work.
           2.  Pick up `v8` from its current pose, `v9`, with the robot arm, `v4`.
           3.  Place `v8` at its target pose, `#o2`, on `v16`.
           4.  Pick up `v12` from its current pose, `v13`, with the robot arm, `v4`.
           5.  Place `v12` at its target pose, `#o2`, on `v16`.
           6.  Pick up `v14` from its current pose, `v15`, with the robot arm, `v4`.
           7.  Place `v14` at its target pose, `#o2`, on `v16`.
           
           The target surface, `v16`, is a rectangle of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I see I need to ensure the placement poses are within this surface.
           
           I'm thinking to place the objects in corners, a slight offset from the edges. `v8` (at 0, 0.08), `v12` (at 0.08, -0.08), `v14` (at -0.08, -0.08), all with z-value 0.781. The rotation is going to stay at 0, since that's simple.  Now, the robot is initially at `bconf(v3)`, but needs to be at `#o3` (which, again, I *don't* have to specify, since the algorithm can figure that out).
           
           Finally, I have to assume the robot's initial state (no unsafe actions in the initial state) will stay true (no `unsafe*` predicates are introduced by the actions). So, no collision issues or other problems will arise.
           
           Here's the plan:
           
           ```
           (move_base v3 #o3 #o0)
           (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v8 (0.0 0.08 0.781 0.0) #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v12 (0.08 -0.08 0.781 0.0) #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v14 (-0.08 -0.08 0.781 0.0) #o1 #o3 #o4)
           ```
           
           The poses for placing objects are distinct, collision-free placements on the surface, and will reach the required states. The problem statement says the plan uses "#" objects and I need to define the poses, but I do not need to define `bconf`, or other properties. All preconditions of the actions should be satisfied and I have the base movement at the start to ensure everything will work.
