           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable with Provided Actions**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` all *on* object `v18`.  Breaking down the *on* predicate, it boils down to finding a pose `p` where each object is both *supported* by `v18` and *atpose* `p`.  Initial state analysis shows that there's a specific pose `#o2` where each target object *is* supported by `v18`.  Therefore, I need to get each object to pose `#o2`.
           
           Checking the initial state, however, they're currently at poses `v9`, `v13`, `v15`, and `v17` respectively. So, the strategy is clear: `pick` them from their current locations and `place` them onto `v18` at pose `#o2`.
           
           Now, the available actions are `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`.  Of these, only `pick` and `place` are relevant.  But here's the kicker: I'm *only* allowed to use the action instance `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This is a huge constraint. It means I *can't* actually perform the `pick` and `place` actions necessary.
           
           Analyzing the `pick` and `place` preconditions, I see they both rely on `kin` facts, which are not explicitly provided.  Without the necessary `kin` facts, I can't even *consider* `pick` and `place`, even if they *were* allowed.
           
           The `move_base` action instance doesn't change any object positions. It can be performed once and it leaves the robot in the same configuration. It is of no use.
           
           Given the explicit constraint on the allowed actions, it's immediately clear that the goal is *unachievable*.  I cannot manipulate the objects' `atpose` facts because I lack the *essential* `pick` and `place` actions.  The available action instance doesn't affect the goal state at all. This problem is therefore unsolvable given the restrictions.
