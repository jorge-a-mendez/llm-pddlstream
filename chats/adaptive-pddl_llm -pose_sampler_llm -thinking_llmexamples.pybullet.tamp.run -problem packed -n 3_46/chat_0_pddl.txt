(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating Object Placements**
           
           My goal is to generate 50 stable placements for a square object (AABB) on a rectangular surface (also an AABB).  "Stable" means the object must be fully contained within the surface, and (eventually) not collide with fixed obstacles or other placed objects (though these collision checks are not yet implemented).  The specific surface I'm working with has the following dimensions and it's index is 0: `0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. The object has sides of length `0.0850283702270962`.
           
           Since the object is square, its effective bounding box (AABB) changes with rotation angle, becoming largest when rotated by multiples of pi/4.  I need to compute the object's effective AABB bounds, which depends on the object's original side length and the rotation `theta`.  The object's rotated effective AABB has dimensions `W_rot = H_rot = L * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. Here L is the side length.
           
           I begin by selecting a few rotation angles: 0, pi/4, pi/2 and 3*pi/4, plus others for the initial planning.
           
           I then calculate the minimum and maximum ranges for the x and y coordinates of the object's center based on these rotation angles, making sure that each corner of the effective AABB of the rotated object remains within the surface's boundaries. The center (x, y) must therefore fall within: `surf_lower_x + W_rot/2 <= x <= surf_upper_x - W_rot/2` and `surf_lower_y + H_rot/2 <= y <= surf_upper_y - H_rot/2`.
           
           For `theta = 0`, the effective bounding box is smallest, and the x and y ranges are therefore the largest, going roughly from -0.092 to 0.092. I create 5 x 5 equally spaced points within those bounds. This gives 25 placements.
           
           For `theta = pi/4`, the effective bounding box is at its maximum size. The range of x and y for placements has narrowed. I place the center at 3 locations x 3 locations within that range, for a total of 9 placements.
           
           For `theta = pi/2`, it is the same as `theta = 0`, so I make another grid with 9 placements (similar to pi/4). This produces 9 additional placements.
           
           For `theta = 3*pi/4`, it is the same as `theta = pi/4` (also at its bounding box maximum size), so I use the same grid positions, for 9 more placements.
           
           I am taking the first 50 placements. I have 52 placements total, but for the final output, I will provide only the first 50.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Object Placement: A Collision-Free Approach**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new square object (ID 6, side length roughly 0.098) to place on surface 0. My challenge? Avoid crashing into the existing square object (ID 5) that's already sitting in the bottom-left corner of the surface.  I've got the placement data for that first object - its center, rotation (0 radians, effectively aligned with the axes), and dimensions, which means I know its bounding box, or "AABB."
           
           My primary concern is making sure the new object doesn't overlap object 5.  This means I must strategically pick placement locations while considering the size of the square.  The rotation of the object has an impact on the minimal bounding box needed to safely place it.
           
           I've calculated my effective object size, factoring in the impact of rotation, with a high precision. I've broken down the valid (x, y) coordinates for placement based on the effective AABB needed to make sure it will not leave the surface.  I will be prioritizing 0 or pi/2 because that has the minimal needed region. To ensure the placement is valid for all rotations, I created a collision threshold that is used to check for no collision with the prior object.
           
           I developed a strategic approach: I began by generating potential locations on a grid to find coordinates for the center of the object. My priority has been to get coordinates for placements at a 0 or pi/2 angle for the object.   I used the collision avoidance threshold to filter out the bad coordinates. I expanded on a 5x5 grid and used a 7x7 grid to get a larger list, then filtered by the threshold. I then needed more positions, and used theta= pi/2 to complete it, starting with a 5x5 grid again.
           
           For each, I made sure there was no overlap between the potential object's position and object 5's bounding box. I filtered out any positions where a corner of the new object would overlap with object 5, guaranteeing a safe, non-colliding placement.
           
           By carefully considering the AABB, the collision condition, and the effective size of object 6, I now have a strategy. I now have the coordinates for 50 valid placements that will not result in a collision.

(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for Object 4**
           
           Alright, I need to figure out 50 stable positions for this new object (ID 4) on surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into either of the pre-existing objects, Object 5 (at (-0.092, -0.092)) and Object 6 (at (0, -0.086)). Object 4 is a square with side length 0.094245, and surface 0 is a square area from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           First, I need to calculate the *effective* side length (`s_eff4`) of Object 4's bounding box depending on its rotation (theta). Then I work out the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates (center) of Object 4, to ensure the entire object is within the valid placement area and that collision with O5 and O6 is avoided.
           
           With `theta = 0`, Object 4's bounding box side is L4 = 0.094245, so the valid region for the center is within the inner square, with edges at `+/-0.0878`. I will also consider rotation by `pi/2`, where bounding box side is the same. For `theta = pi/4` and `3*pi/4`, the calculation is a bit different, where `s_eff4` is `L4*sqrt(2)` and center must stay inside `+/-0.0683`.
           
           To avoid collisions, for all rotations (theta), I must apply `x_min >=  x5_max` or `y_min >= y5_max` and `x_max <= x6_min` or `x_min >= x6_max` or `y_min >= y6_max`. In theta-0 situation, the exclusion constraints become: `x >= -0.00284` or `y >= -0.00284` for collision with O5 and `x <= -0.09629` or `y >= 0.0104` for collision with O6.
           
           To find these positions efficiently, I'm setting up a grid of potential locations, checking each one for collisions. For `theta = 0`, I'm going with a 7x7 grid. For `theta = pi/2`, I use a 5x5 grid. Then I will generate a 4x4 grid for `theta=pi/4` and the same for `theta=3*pi/4`. This should generate enough possible valid positions. After the grid generation, I'll filter out colliding positions. The positions will be converted to the appropriate format and returned.
