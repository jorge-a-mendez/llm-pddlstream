           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my plan to stack v8, v12, and v14 on v16.**
           
           It boils down to getting each object (v8, v12, and v14) to the correct pose (#o2) on v16.  Since I know they're *already* graspable and supported by v16, and I have the kinematics, it's a straightforward pick-and-place problem using arm v4. The only base motion I have is a no-op, so the base must already be in the right configuration (#o3), which is currently v3.
           
           Here's the sequence:
           
           1.  **Pick v12** from its initial pose (v13) using v4 and grasp #o1.
           2.  **Place v12** at the target pose (#o2) on v16.
           3.  **Pick v14** from its initial pose (v15) using v4 and grasp #o1.
           4.  **Place v14** at the target pose (#o2) on v16.
           5.  **Pick v8** from its initial pose (v9) using v4 and grasp #o1.
           6.  **Place v8** at the target pose (#o2) on v16.
           
           The provided information guarantees this plan should work. Since it is explicitly stated that every fact in the plan is false, then the negated axioms regarding safety, and unsafepose, unsafeapproach, and unsafeatraj are always true.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Plan Impossibility**
           
           Okay, so I've been presented with a fundamental constraint that I completely overlooked initially. The user rightly pointed out that my previous attempt used actions that are *not* permitted.  I need to stick to the allowed actions, and in this case, the robot can only `move_base` from `v3` to `v3` using trajectory `#o0`.  This is severely limiting.  Essentially, the robot can't do anything that alters its base position relative to any other object.
           
           The goal is to have objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all be `on` the object `v16`.  This means they need to be *supported* by `v16` and be at a specific pose.  Looking at the initial state, I see that these supported facts are *already* true. However, the relevant `atpose` facts are not as needed. To make the necessary changes, I need to adjust the `atpose` for the blocks. This is where things get tricky.
           
           My understanding is that `pick` and `place` actions are the key to altering those `atpose` facts. Specifically, picking an object *removes* it from its current pose, and placing it *adds* it to a new pose.  The problem?  *Neither* of those actions (`pick` or `place`) is on the list of permitted actions.  I'm basically handcuffed here.  Since I'm stuck with `move_base`, I can't manipulate objects. Therefore,  the goal state simply *cannot* be reached within the given constraints. The robot is effectively unable to change anything about the initial situation. The goal is unachievable given the allowable actions.
