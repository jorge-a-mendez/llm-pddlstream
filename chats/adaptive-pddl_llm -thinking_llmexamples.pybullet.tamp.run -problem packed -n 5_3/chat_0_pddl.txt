           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, here's the situation. I'm given a PDDL domain and a set of action instances, and my task is to devise a plan to move several objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) onto a target object, v20.  My initial analysis reveals these objects are all currently "on" v11, which likely represents a table or a surface.  The key to success is `on(object, surface)` where it has supporting facts of `atpose` and `supported`. The obvious solution, assuming the standard manipulation domain, requires `pick` and `place` actions to physically move the objects from v11 to v20.
           
           The trouble is, the provided action instances are severely limited.  I see a single `move_base` action that essentially does nothing, a self-loop. However, the critical elements, the actions `pick` and `place`, are *completely absent* from the provided set.
           
           Analyzing the initial state, I see each of these target objects is already *supported* in a valid `on` pose currently relative to their current table: `atpose` and `supported` are confirmed.  The goal is to repeat this same configuration relative to `v20`.  The required precondition for achieving the goal state are `atpose` for the goal objects with `v20` as the supporting object: `atpose(o, #o2)` and `supported(o, #o2, v20)`.  To achieve that, I would need a sequence: `pick`, `place`, pick, place, pick, place, pick place, pick, place.
           
           Without `pick` and `place`, there's no way to manipulate any object.  The `move_base` action instance doesn't affect the object's positions. Cooking and cleaning are not relevant here. I've also verified that my preconditions align with pick and place: `kin`, `atpose`, `handempty`, and various safety checks. The conclusion is inescapable:  since `pick` and `place` are necessary, and they're not provided, the goal is *unachievable* given the current action set and the explicit restriction that only provided actions are allowed.  I've exhausted all options; this problem is unsolvable with the provided tools.
