           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Goal Breakdown and Potential Actions**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which I need to achieve. Expanding this, it boils down to needing an object of a specific type ('green') to be placed 'on' another object (v18). Since I know the initial state has two objects of the correct type (v8 and v12), and I also know that both v8 and v12 are 'supported' by v18 (thanks to the initial state), I've narrowed it down to either placing v8 on v18 or placing v12 on v18.  I'm going to proceed by choosing v8.
           
           To achieve this, I need to figure out how to satisfy the requirements for 'on(v8, v18)'. This means I need to make sure that two conditions are met: (1) v8 must be supported by v18 and (2) it needs to be "atpose" (#o2 - in this instance). I see from the initial state that `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is true. That leaves me with the problem of getting v8 *to* pose #o2.  
           
           The initial state reveals that v8 is currently at pose v9. The robot, using arm v4, is currently at base configuration v3.
           
           **Plan Formulation**
           
           The plan I've come up with is as follows:
           
           1.  **Move the robot base:** I need to move the robot base from its current configuration at v3 to some other configuration (`#o3`).  The robot needs to be at that configuration to perform the subsequent pick-and-place actions.
           2.  **Pick:** Using arm v4, pick up object v8 from pose v9.
           3.  **Place:** Then, use arm v4 to place v8 at pose #o2, which, as I see from the initial state, is 'supported' by v18.
           
           **Preconditions and Potential Issues**
           
           I went through the available actions to see if they fit.
           
           *   `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`:  This action allows me to get the robot base to the necessary base configuration for the pick/place actions. The base configuration is '#o3'.
           *   `pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           *   `place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           
           The problem is that for the pick and place actions, the robot must be at a base configuration that isn't specified, and has to be set as '#o3'.  This will be resolved by the first step in my plan.
           
           **Safety Considerations**
           
           The problem statement mentions that anything *not* explicitly stated is false. This will be very relevant for the safety preconditions. Specifically, the negations of `unsafeapproach`, `unsafepose`, and `unsafeatraj` are all true by default.  This means I don't have to worry about these safety concerns, which is helpful.
           
           **Pose Calculation**
           
           Now, I need to provide a pose for `#o2`. I need to ensure it's safe and stable (according to the given constraints).  v8 has the AABB ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)), which is currently at `v9`. I've determined that a good location is to set `v8` in the center of v18, which is from x = 4.2 to x = 4.8 and y = -0.6 to y = 0.0, and since the initial state states `pose(v8, #o2)` is true, I will provide a stable pose for it on the surface of v18.  Placing the object with a z of 0.8, the dimensions of the object, and location of the surface, I'm going to set #o2 to be (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0).  
           
           **Final Plan**
           
           In summary, the detailed plan is:
           
           1.  `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` (move robot base)
           2.  `pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4` (pick v8)
           3.  `place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4` (place v8 at pose #o2)
           
           I believe this plan is valid and will achieve the desired goal, given the initial state, provided values can be found for #o1, #o3, and #o4
