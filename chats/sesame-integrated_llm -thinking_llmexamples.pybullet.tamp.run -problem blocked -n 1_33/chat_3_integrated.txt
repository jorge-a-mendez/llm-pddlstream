           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.384, 0.14), (-4.294, 0.23)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.339, 0.185, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.57, 0.822).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.196, 0.513)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Achieving the Goal**
           
           Okay, I've got a clear objective: to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` condition. This breaks down into making sure that `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true. Thankfully, `type(v12, v17)` is already true in the initial state. So, all I need to do is get `v12` onto `v18`.
           
           The rule is straightforward: `on(?o, ?r)` is true if we can make `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)` true.  The good news is, I can see that `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` is already present. This means I need to move `v12` to pose `#o2` for this to work.
           
           Here's my plan:
           1.  **Move Base:** The robot needs to be in the right base configuration to pick and place. So, I will move the robot base from `v3` to `#o3`.
           2.  **Pick:** The robot arm (`v4`) will pick up `v12` from its current pose `v13`.
           3.  **Place:** The robot arm will place `v12` at the target pose `#o2` on the surface `v18`.
           
           Now, let's look at the continuous values for `#o2`! I've determined `v12` needs to be placed on top of `v18`. From the scene geometry, I've picked a value within the AABB of `v18`. `#o2` pose: (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0), ensuring the object rests at a good height and orientation on the table.
           
           With this plan and pose, I can execute.
