           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v1 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.294, 0.164), (-1.189, 0.269)).

           Object v15 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom boils down to verifying a conjunction of several conditions.  I see a need to prove the existence of two images and two analyses.  Specifically, I need: `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           The initial state, however, doesn't contain any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` facts. So, I need to figure out *how* to generate these.  The available action instances, which is my operational constraint, are very limited: only `move` and `drop_rock` actions are available.  The `move` actions are essentially no-ops in this context, keeping the rovers in place.  The `drop_rock` actions wouldn't be helpful, because the rovers' stores are already free.
           
           This is where the problem lies. I'm missing the critical actions I need to make progress: I don't see any `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` actions.  These actions are the only way to produce the required `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates.  
           
           Given my understanding of the problem statement, which emphasizes the restricted set of *allowed* action instances, I'm forced to conclude that this goal is *unreachable*. I can't generate the necessary data without the necessary actions.  It's a frustrating situation; the constraints are too tight to allow a feasible plan. The system will probably return an unsatisfiable answer.
