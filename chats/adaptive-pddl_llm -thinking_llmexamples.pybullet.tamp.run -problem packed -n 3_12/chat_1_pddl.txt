           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`. Looking at the initial state and the 'on' axiom, it's clear I need to ensure each object is at a pose where it's supported by v16.  This means getting v8, v12, and v14 to pose #o2, because the 'supported' facts indicate that they will be on v16 if at that pose.
           
           Currently, v8 is at pose v9, v12 is at v13, and v14 is at v15.  The available actions are `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`.  Clearly, clean and cook are irrelevant to my goal, which is about positioning objects.  Move_base only affects base configuration. The crux of the problem lies in `pick` and `place`. To move an object from one pose to another, I need to pick it up and then place it at the target pose.
           
           However, here's the catch: the only valid action instance I have is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. There are NO `pick` or `place` instances available to use. Looking at the  `kin` facts, it would seem I need a base configuration of `#o3` to perform `pick`. However, since I can't move the base to the right configuration, I can't pick up the object. This is a fatal flaw.
           
           Therefore, since I cannot pick and place these objects, I cannot change their poses. If I cannot change their poses, and they are not *currently* at a pose supported by v16, the goal is simply unattainable. The only action I can take, 'move_base', is completely useless in this scenario.  The conclusion is inescapable: the goal is unreachable given the restricted set of actions available. I cannot achieve `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`. The planning problem is unsolvable with this given set of actions.
