           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning for a Minimal-Cost Plan**
           
           Okay, here's my thought process. The problem boils down to getting `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` on `v16`. Since I know `on` is defined by `supported` and `atpose`, I need to find poses for these objects that are both supported by `v16` and can be reached. Looking at the initial state and the available `supported` facts, it's clear the target pose is `#o2`. The trick is how to get the objects *to* `#o2`.
           
           Since I have a robot with two arms, I need to figure out the most effective way to manipulate the objects. I have kinesthetic information (the `kin` facts) for arm `v4` and, luckily, this arm is the key as its kin information seems directly applicable to the objects and desired pose. Both arms are currently `handempty`, and the task is to move the objects currently resting on `v11` to the shared pose `#o2`. This seems like a simple pick-and-place problem, making `move_base`, `pick`, and `place` the appropriate actions.
           
           To minimize the cost, I reasoned that the robot should move to a manipulation pose once and then do all the work from there. The `move_base` action requires base configuration `#o3` for the manipulation, so that's the first step. Then, I can repeatedly pick each object, place it at `#o2`, and repeat the process for all the necessary items. I'm using the robot's arm `v4` for this because it has the required `kin` information for each move. I ensured that all the preconditions are met and negative literals are not violated.
