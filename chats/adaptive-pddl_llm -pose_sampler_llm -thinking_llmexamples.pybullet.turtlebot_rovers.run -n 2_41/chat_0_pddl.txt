User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point.

           Okay, so the goal is to figure out three good spots for a robot to stand near a specific target point. These spots have to be within a certain distance of the target and, crucially, avoid running into any obstacles in the environment. The environment is a defined area, basically a box, with a bunch of smaller boxes scattered around. There's also a big vertical "wall" right in the middle, and I need to keep that in mind.
           
           I'm thinking of this in a few steps: First, I figure out the target's location. Then, I generate a bunch of possible locations around that target, all within a certain distance. For each possible location, I need to check if it's within the overall environment boundaries. I also need to check if the robot's base will collide with *any* of the defined AABB obstacles.
           
           There's a catch, though. It's not just about avoiding collisions at the robot's base. I've got to consider line-of-sight too. Because the robot will automatically orient toward the target, I've got to make sure there's a clear path from its position to the target - no obstacles in the way.
           
           I'm thinking to approach this by generating candidate positions in a circular pattern around the target point. But since I know I need to be careful with the geometry, let's proceed step by step.
           
           I need three different positions. Let's see what I get and if they pass all the tests, including an additional check for line-of-sight blockage with obstacle 5. I've updated my code to check for the big central wall (Obstacle 5) to ensure line-of-sight. If both the robot and the target are on the same side, it's good. Now I have a well-formed solution.
