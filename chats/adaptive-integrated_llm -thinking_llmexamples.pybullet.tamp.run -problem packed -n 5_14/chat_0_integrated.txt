           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:

           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.116, -0.247, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.352, 0.936).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Alright, the task is clear: I need to get five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) all "on" object v20.  The "on" predicate is straightforward: it means an object is supported by another, and it’s at a specific pose.  The target for each object is to be at pose "#o2," which is associated with v20. Initially, all five objects are supported by v11, at various poses (v9, v13, v15, v17, and v19, respectively).
           
           The robot has two arms, v4 and v6. Both are empty at the start and the base, v3, is fixed.  The only action I'm *allowed* to use, according to the instructions, is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  This is a huge problem.
           
           **Action Analysis and Planning Constraints**
           
           The core of this problem is picking and placing objects.  To get objects "on" v20, I'd need to pick them up from their starting poses and place them at pose "#o2."  But, the problem *explicitly* states that I can only use action instances from the given list, and that list *only* includes a no-op move base action.
           
           The `pick` action's preconditions require kinematic solutions (`kin`), the object to be at the pose, a free hand, and a collision-free approach and arm trajectory.  The `place` action has similar requirements, with the target pose and retraction trajectories being collision-free.  Since `move_base` is the only action instance allowed, and it's constrained to no movement, any `pick` and `place` action instance would immediately violate the "allowed" list.
           
           **Collision Consideration**
           
           I need to select poses that are stable on surface v20.  I have the AABBs of all surfaces and objects, which allows me to compute stable pose for v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18 on top of v20.
           
           **Unsolvability due to Action Instance Restriction**
           
           I'm forced to conclude that the goal is *unachievable* given the restrictive definition of "valid action instances."  I can't pick up or put down anything.  Without `pick` and `place` actions, there's no way to move the objects from their starting supports to the target (v20). The `move_base` action does not provide the state change required. This is a crucial, if initially unexpected, finding. The goal cannot be met.
