           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning the Robot's Task**
           
           Okay, so I've got a plan to hatch. The core of it involves getting these five objects – `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` – from their current spots on surface `v11` and carefully placing them onto surface `v20`. The robot, being a resourceful bot, has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, but the crucial `kin` facts only concern `v4`. Both arms start `handempty`. My base is at `v3`, and thankfully it remains fixed for this task.
           
           Here's my logic: the goal is to get each object 'on' `v20`. This means ensuring each object is *supported* by `v20` at a specific *pose*. I know these objects are all stackable on `v20`. For each object, there's a specific pose `#o2` supported by `v20`.
           
           The only actions I can use are `move_base v3 v3 #o0` (which is a 0 cost "move"), `pick`, and `place`. So, I'm thinking a sequence of `pick` and `place` actions for each object will be the game. The 'move_base' action isn't strictly necessary as the robot's base doesn't actually move. But since it's an available instance, and it does not affect any preconditions or state.
           
           Let's break down the process for one object, say `v8`:
           
           1.  **Pick** `v8` from its current pose `v9`.
           2.  **Place** `v8` at a new pose `#o2` (a target spot) on `v20`.
           
           Crucially, arm `v4` is what I'll be using. All the `kin` facts are for `v4`. These facts give me the necessary info for picking and placing `v8`, including `grasp #o1`. The current poses, surface values and kinematic values, I will use.
           
           Initial state:
           *   `v8` is at pose `v9` on surface `v11`. It is `graspable`.
           *   Both `v4` and `v6` are `handempty`.
           *   The `kin` facts I have, I will assume, correctly provide the required parameters.
           
           Collision avoidance? Nope! No `cfree` or `~test-cfree` facts, so I'll assume that all `kin` values have been vetted, so no collisions, so no special conditions on poses.
           
           So, here's my general plan:
           
           1.  For each object (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, `v18`):
               *   **Pick** the object from its current pose using arm `v4`.
               *   **Place** the object at its target pose `#o2` on `v20` using arm `v4`.
           
           Let me get the initial poses:
           *   `v8` is at `v9`.
           *   `v12` is at `v13`.
           *   `v14` is at `v15`.
           *   `v16` is at `v17`.
           *   `v18` is at `v19`.
           
           My current pose is `v3`, which will remain fixed.
           My grasp is always `#o1`, my `bconf` is `#o3`, and `atraj` is `#o4`.
           
           Before the Pick/Place, I will execute a *move_base* to trigger an update. *Move Base* is included, but is not used (if it isn't necessary). So, I assume, with the current facts, this should work.
           
           Alright, the exact sequence will be:
           
           1.  (move\_base v3 v3 #o0)
           2.  (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           3.  (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           4.  (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           5.  (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           6.  (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           7.  (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           8.  (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 #o3 #o
)

               *   **Place** the object at its target pose `#o2` on `v20` using arm `v4`.
           
           Let me get the initial poses:
           *   `v8` is at `v9`.
           *   `v12` is at `v13`.
           *   `v14` is at `v15`.

           *   `v18` is at `v19`.
           
           My current pose is `v3`, which will remain fixed.
           My grasp is always `#o1`, my `bconf` is `#o3`, and `atraj` is `#o4`.

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Assessing the Feasibility of the Task**
           
           Okay, so the user has flagged the previous plan as invalid. I can see why. The only action currently valid is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which just moves the robot's base. It's a non-starter for what we need to do.
           
           The goal is to get five objects, specifically v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18, all onto v20. That means *all* of them need to be moved from their current location, which is v11.  The `on` predicate, which is the key to this, needs to be true for each object to be considered "on" v20.  The axiom tells me that `on` means the object must be *supported* in a particular *pose* on v20.
           
           Looking at the initial state, I see that the target objects are *supported* by #o2 on v20. This indicates that #o2 is a valid *pose type* for each object when they're on v20.  So, the plan *should* involve picking them up from v11, placing them in pose #o2, and then somehow placing them *on* v20.
           
           Here's the problem: I've got a `move_base` action, but that's it. To manipulate these objects, I need `pick` and `place` actions.  Those actions are essential to achieve the goal of rearranging the blocks. But they're not in the list of valid actions.
           
           Given the constraints, I have to conclude that the goal is *unachievable* with the given action set. I'm essentially handcuffed without the necessary tools (i.e., `pick` and `place` actions). I need to get the user to give me different actions.

           The goal is to get five objects, specifically v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18, all onto v20. That means *all* of them need to be moved from their current location, which is v11.  The `on` predicate, which is the key to this, needs to be true for each object to be considered "on" v20.  The axiom tells me that `on` means the object must be *supported* in a particular *pose* on v20.
           
           Looking at the initial state, I see that the target objects are *supported* by #o2 on v20. This indicates that #o2 is a valid *pose type* for each object when they're on v20.  So, the plan *should* involve picking them up from v11, placing them in pose #o2, and then somehow placing them *on* v20.
           
           Here's the problem: I've got a `move_base` action, but that's it. To manipulate these objects, I need `pick` and `place` actions.  Those actions are essential to achieve the goal of rearranging the blocks. But they're not in the list of valid actions.
           
           Given the constraints, I have to conclude that the goal is *unachievable* with the given action set. I'm essentially handcuffed without the necessary tools (i.e., `pick` and `place` actions). I need to get the user to give me different actions.
