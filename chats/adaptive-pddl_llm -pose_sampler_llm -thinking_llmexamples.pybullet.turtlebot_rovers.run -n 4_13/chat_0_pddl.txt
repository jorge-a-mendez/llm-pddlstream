           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Impossibility Analysis**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom requires several conditions to be met, including the acquisition of four received images, as well as received analysis reports for both a stone and soil. Analyzing the initial state, I've observed that the conditions `atconf` and `free` are already satisfied. However, none of the images have been received, nor have the necessary analyses.
           
           Careful scrutiny of the provided actions reveals a significant constraint: the only permissible actions are `move` and `drop_rock`. Unfortunately, these actions are inadequate for attaining the required images and analyses.  The `drop_rock` action is also unusable due to its preconditions of `full` stores, which are not true in the initial state. Moreover, the move action might delete the `atconf` facts, making the goal even harder to achieve.
           
           To receive an image, the `send_image` action is needed, which in turn requires  `take_image`,  `calibrate`, among others.  Similarly, the `send_analysis` action is required to receive the analyses reports, which needs `sample_rock`. However, these critical actions are not in the permitted list.
           
           Therefore, given the restrictive actions and the initial state, the goal is definitively unachievable. The available actions do not provide the means to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` goal. It appears the problem has been intentionally constructed with an unattainable goal given the available actions.
