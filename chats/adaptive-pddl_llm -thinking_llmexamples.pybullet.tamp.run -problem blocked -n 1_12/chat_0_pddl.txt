           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unachievable Goal in the PR2-TAMP Domain**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object, which I'll call `?green`, both "on" a specific object (`v18`) and of a specific type (`v17`).  I can see that either `v8` or `v12` could fit the `?green` role because they both have the `type(?, v17)` property in the initial state.  So, my goal really becomes ensuring that either `v8` or `v12` is "on" `v18`.
           
           "On" is defined by two sub-goals: a support relationship and a posed relationship.  In other words, the `?green` needs to be supported by, and posed at, `v18`.  Looking at the initial state, I see that I *already* have support from `v18` for both `v8` and `v12` (via the `supported` predicate). The challenge is the "pose" part, the `atpose` predicate.  Currently, `v8` is at `v9` and `v12` is at `v13`.  To achieve the goal, I need to get either `v8` or `v12` to `#o2`, which *is* the pose associated with the `supported(?, #o2, v18)` facts in the initial state.
           
           The key is in the manipulation of objects, changing their `atpose` values.  I need to move `v8` (or `v12`) from its current pose to `#o2` pose to then satisfy the `on` subgoal and thus the `new-axiom@0()` goal. However, upon scrutinizing the "available action instances", I find a critical limitation. The only action at my disposal is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`.  This action modifies the configuration of the robot's base but *cannot* directly change the `atpose` of any object. I would need to use `pick` and `place` actions to manipulate the objects. Unfortunately, `pick` and `place` are NOT in the available action instances.
           
           Considering the action instances available, the `move_base` action would affect `atbconf`, making a move base action ineffective in changing an object’s `atpose`.
           
           Without the ability to `pick` and `place` objects or other means to manipulate the objects within the scene, I am unable to modify the configuration of the objects. The current initial state does *not* satisfy the conditions for the goal.
           
           In summary, the limited action set prevents me from achieving the goal. The goal requires an action that the provided action set simply does not contain. No matter which object I choose, I cannot achieve the necessary poses. Therefore, the goal is unreachable with the given action set.
