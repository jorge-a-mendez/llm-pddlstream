           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Analysis: Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm looking at this `new-axiom@0()` goal, and it's pretty clear it boils down to getting some object, which can be either `v8` or `v12`, *on* `v18`.  "On" means it needs to be *supported* by `v18` at a specific *pose*.  From the initial state, I can see that *both* `v8` and `v12` *are* supported by `v18` *at* the pose `#o2`. The problem is that neither `v8` nor `v12` are *currently* *at* pose `#o2`. `v8` is at `v9`, and `v12` is at `v13`.
           
           To get them *to* `#o2`, I need `pick` and `place` actions. Now, I have `kin` facts for `v4` that define how it can manipulate objects, and these are crucially linked to the base configuration `#o3`.  The trouble is, the robot is *currently* at `v3`, and there's *no* way to *move* from `v3` to `#o3` using the only *allowed* action, which is a *do-nothing* `move_base`. So, *that's* a problem.
           
           The `pick` and `place` actions need `atbconf(#o3)` to be true, and right now, the robot has `atbconf(v3)`.  The `move_base` action instance doesn't even actually *change* the robot's base configuration. It just sets `canmove()` to *false*, which seems pointless, and the `move_base` action instance won't get it to `atbconf(#o3)`. Since *no other actions are allowed*, I'm stuck.
           
           I *can't* use `v4` to move anything because it would require the base to be `#o3`. Furthermore, there are no `kin` facts for `v6`. That's not good. Consequently, because I cannot use pick and place actions, I *cannot* change the objects' pose. So `v8` and `v12` will not be on `v18`. Therefore, I cannot satisfy `new-axiom@0()`. Given the constraints, the goal is *unreachable*.
