User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.002, 0.416), (0.099, 0.513)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.103, -0.545), (-0.007, -0.449)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.05, 0.464, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.282, 0.959).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.055, -0.497, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.964, -0.267).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.098, 0.509, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.686, 0.727).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, 0.472), (-0.061, 0.546)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom supported(v14, v15, v11)
           Atom stackable(v14, v10)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom atpose(v14, v15)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom stackable(v14, v16)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Goal Breakdown and Constraints**
           
           Alright, the task at hand is to devise a plan to move three objects (v8, v12, and v14) onto surface v16. Simple enough, right? I need to find a sequence of actions that will get these objects from their current location (v11) to their desired location (v16). The constraints are straightforward: ensure the objects are supported on v16 (`on(object, v16)`) and that they stay in their pose (`atpose(object, ?p)`).
           
           **Understanding the Initial State**
           
           Currently, all the objects (v8, v12, and v14) are stacked on surface v11. The robot has two arms, both empty and in their initial configurations. The problem gives very limited action primitives. It's just a simple "move_base" no-op to start. This means the robot's base configuration is ideal to begin. It's time to craft an efficient plan that involves picking, placing, and no base movements to solve this.
           
           **Geometric Considerations and Placement Challenges**
           
           Here's where things get interesting: I'm given the dimensions and AABB ranges of objects and target. The objects are roughly the size of 0.1m, and surface v16 has an AABB of `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`. Three such objects cannot possibly fit neatly into this space without a collision. Even trying to place them in a line is unfeasible due to the bounds. My collision calculations show that any attempt to fit the three objects (v8, v12, v14) in the given surface (v16) in a collision-free manner is geometrically impossible. Based on my analysis and the AABB of the objects and the target surface, this task is impossible to achieve without violating the collision-free constraint.
           
           **Conclusion: Task Unachievable**
           
           Despite my best efforts, I haven't come up with a valid non-colliding pose arrangement. Based on my geometric analysis, it is impossible. Given the given geometry and the strict "collision-free and fully contained" constraints, this goal is unreachable.
