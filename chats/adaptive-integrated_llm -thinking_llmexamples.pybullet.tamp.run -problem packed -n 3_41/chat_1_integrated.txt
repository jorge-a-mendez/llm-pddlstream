User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.002, 0.416), (0.099, 0.513)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, 0.472), (-0.061, 0.546)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.05, 0.464, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.282, 0.959).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.103, -0.545), (-0.007, -0.449)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.098, 0.509, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.686, 0.727).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.055, -0.497, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.964, -0.267).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning:**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. My goal is to get objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto surface `v16`. Since all the available actions are related to picking and placing, and the problem explicitly states that cleaning/cooking are irrelevant, I'm focusing on those.
           
           First, I need to understand the initial state. Right now, all three objects are on a shelf or table (surface `v11`). Each object has a specific pose (e.g., `v8` is at `v9`). Since I'm an expert, I recognize that the key is to *pick* each object from its current location and *place* it onto `v16`.
           
           To pick, I need the arm `v4` to be empty (`handempty`), at the base configuration `v3`, and the correct *kin*ematic relationships established (given by `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`). Similarly, for the place action, the arm should have picked the object already.
           
           The crucial part is the *place* action. The goal requires all objects to be *on* `v16`, which means `atpose` and `supported`. The parameter `#o2` is used in the PDDL for all three objects as the target pose. However, the problem specifies that when multiple objects are to be placed simultaneously at the same pose, I must assign distinct coordinate values, i.e., I must assign different continuous locations for them. The problem wants the exact `x`, `y`, `z`, and `theta` values of `#o2`.
           
           So, I need to find suitable placement locations on `v16`. The dimensions of `v16` and the approximate dimensions of the objects must be considered to make sure they all fit. The height `0.781` is likely relative to `v11`. If I place the objects on `v16`, I must ensure that their `z` is the right value or is at 0 if the robot cannot directly stack or balance. Given the context, my expert intuition is that objects being on the same plane, so I should keep all `z=0.781`.
           
           Since the objects are rectangular, I'll place them side-by-side, using distinct x-coordinates within `v16`. I have to also satisfy the collision checking with `NegatedAtom` for the pick and place commands. Since there are no robots moving and the placement poses are clearly specified as being apart, I would ensure there is no collision as I will make sure the placement locations do not overlap.
           
           Therefore, the plan will be:
           1. Pick `v8` from `v9`.
           2. Place `v8` at location: `(0.0 0.0 0.781 0.0)` on `v16`.
           3. Pick `v12` from `v13`.
           4. Place `v12` at location: `(-0.08 0.0 0.781 0.0)` on `v16`.
           5. Pick `v14` from `v15`.
           6. Place `v14` at location: `(0.08 0.0 0.781 0.0)` on `v16`.
           
           This should successfully achieve the goal and I am an expert so I am sure that I will be able to construct the correct PDDL code for the robot.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Goal Reachability**
           
           Okay, so I've been presented with a challenging scenario. The user correctly pointed out a critical flaw: the initial plan utilized actions (`pick`, `place`) that are *not* permitted according to the provided action list. The *only* allowed action is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This action, essentially a no-op that just moves the robot's base without affecting the objects, won't help me achieve the desired goal.
           
           The goal itself is clear: to arrange objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` on object `v16`. Since `on` is defined as `supported AND atpose`, I need to manipulate the `atpose` predicates for these objects to be on `v16`.  Looking at the initial state,  `v8` is on `v11` (specifically at pose `v9`), `v12` is also on `v11` (pose `v13`), and `v14` is on `v11` (pose `v15`).
           
           The issue is this: changing `atpose` usually relies on `pick` and `place` actions, which are *not* available. Without those, the `atpose` predicates remain unchanged. Consequently, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` will remain on `v11`, in their original poses, and will never be on `v16`. Therefore, with the *given* constraints – the limited action list – the goal is simply **unreachable**.
