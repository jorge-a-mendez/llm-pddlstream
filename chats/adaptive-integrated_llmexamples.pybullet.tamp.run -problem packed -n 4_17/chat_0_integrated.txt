User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.157, -0.395), (-0.08, -0.318)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.106, -0.344), (0.205, -0.245)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.232, 0.427), (-0.145, 0.514)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.119, -0.357, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.055, 0.998).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.027, -0.462), (0.122, -0.367)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.156, -0.294, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.368, 0.93).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.189, 0.47, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.99, -0.144).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.075, -0.415, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.859, 0.512).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is to place all four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) onto object v18. Currently, all objects are on object v11. Since object v18 is a small object, only one object can be placed on it at a time. Therefore, we must pick up each object from v11 and place it onto v18. The problem is that there are no pick or place actions available in the provided action instances. Only `move_base` is available. Therefore, the goal is not achievable.
