           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:

           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q3', '#t9'))

           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q4', '#q9', '#t17'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v16', 'v17', '#g0', '#q9', '#t15'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q9', '#q0', '#t16'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v16', 'p8', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0'))

           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v18', 'p9', '#g4', '#q5', '#t5'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-approach-pose:('v12', 'p6', '#g1', 'v8', 'p5')->()`, which impeded executing the action pick('v4', 'v12', 'v13', '#g1', '#q1', '#t1').
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions. If the failure occurs after placing on any pose that does not start with '#', it may be due to using a combination of invalid poses.As the expert, you may decide to choose additional poses, providing their continuous values using any free pose starting with '#'. 

(Thoughts: **Reflecting on the Plan to Move Objects**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to orchestrate the movement of five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) from their current positions on surface v11 to surface v20.  I've got pre-computed target poses for each object on v20, but the initial plan failed. It flagged a collision during the approach phase of placing object v12.  This means the robot's end-effector or the object itself would collide with v8, which was already in place.
           
           The culprit is likely the close proximity of the target poses.  Let's examine.  V12's target is p6 (0.0, 0.09, 0.782), and v8's is p5 (0.0, 0.0, 0.782).  Given their bounding boxes and these poses, they're almost touching. The specific problem is `test-cfree-approach-pose:('v12', 'p6', '#g1', 'v8', 'p5')->()` which indicates the issue happens during the arm's approach motion.
           
           To solve this, I need to either change the target poses or the order of placement.  Those predefined poses, p5 through p9, appear to be too compact and centric for all objects.
           
           My strategy needs to be smart. I need to spread out the objects on v20 so that the robot arm has clear approach paths.  Since I can't directly influence the approach path, changing the target pose is my primary recourse.  I can use the generic pose `#o2`. I will use the `#o2` pose to spread out the placement poses.
           
           Now for this surface, v20 AABB is ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           `v8`: AABB  ((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035)). Small. Centered at origin. Easy.
           `v12`: AABB  ((-0.035, 0.055), (0.035, 0.125)). Longish, oriented towards +y.
           `v14`: AABB  ((-0.035, -0.125), (0.035, -0.055)).  Similar to v12, but oriented towards -y.
           `v16`: AABB  ((0.055, -0.035), (0.125, 0.035)).  Oriented towards +x.
           `v18`: AABB  ((-0.167, -0.376), (-0.075, -0.284)). Very unusual.
           
           Let's focus on `v18`.  Its AABB doesn't match a good placement on the existing poses. The best thing is to give `v18` a central location that is outside of the placement region for the other four objects. By placing it centrally in (0,0), all the other objects should be arranged around. So `p20`.
           To center `v18` on (0,0,0.782), I calculate the origin offset to be (0.121, 0.33, 0.782, 0.0) from the center.
           
           Now, for each of the objects, I'll strategically place them to avoid collision, spreading them to the edges of the table in a uniform pattern. Since all the other objects are of size 0.07 x 0.07, and the table's area of interest is 0.27 x 0.27, I calculate new target locations for the placement pose `#o2`:
           - **v8:**  Footprint (-0.135, -0.065), (0.065, 0.135). Location = (-0.1, 0.1).
           - **v12:** Footprint (0.065, 0.135), (0.065, 0.135). Location = (0.1, 0.01).
           - **v14:** Footprint (-0.135, -0.065), (-0.135, -0.065). Location = (-0.1, -0.01).
           - **

Model:     **Reflecting on the Plan to Move Objects**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to orchestrate the movement of five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) from their current positions on surface v11 to surface v20.  I've got pre-computed target poses for each object on v20, but the initial plan failed. It flagged a collision during the approach phase of placing object v12.  This means the robot's end-effector or the object itself would collide with v8, which was already in place.
           
           The culprit is likely the close proximity of the target poses.  Let's examine.  V12's target is p6 (0.0, 0.09, 0.782), and v8's is p5 (0.0, 0.0, 0.782).  Given their bounding boxes and these poses, they're almost touching. The specific problem is `test-cfree-approach-pose:('v12', 'p6', '#g1', 'v8', 'p5')->()` which indicates the issue happens during the arm's approach motion.
           
           To solve this, I need to either change the target poses or the order of placement.  Those predefined poses, p5 through p9, appear to be too compact and centric for all objects.
           
           My strategy needs to be smart. I need to spread out the objects on v20 so that the robot arm has clear approach paths.  Since I can't directly influence the approach path, changing the target pose is my primary recourse.  I can use the generic pose `#o2`. I will use the `#o2` pose to spread out the placement poses.
           
           Now for this surface, v20 AABB is ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           `v8`: AABB  ((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035)). Small. Centered at origin. Easy.
           `v12`: AABB  ((-0.035, 0.055), (0.035, 0.125)). Longish, oriented towards +y.
           `v14`: AABB  ((-0.035, -0.125), (0.035, -0.055)).  Similar to v12, but oriented towards -y.
           `v16`: AABB  ((0.055, -0.035), (0.125, 0.035)).  Oriented towards +x.
           `v18`: AABB  ((-0.167, -0.376), (-0.075, -0.284)). Very unusual.

(Thoughts: **My Revised Plan for Object Placement on Surface v20**
           
           Okay, so the feedback indicates some issues with the stability of the object poses I previously calculated on surface v20. The primary culprit seems to be the object's 2D AABB not being fully contained within the surface's AABB.  I need to re-evaluate those placements.
           
           Surface v20 has an AABB of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`, meaning it's 0.27 meters wide and tall, centered at (0,0).  The core rule is simple: for an object at a given pose, its entire world-frame AABB must fit within this v20 AABB.  If there's no rotation (theta = 0), this is straightforward:  if the object has local AABB `((minx_obj, miny_obj), (maxx_obj, maxy_obj))` and is placed at `(px, py)` its world-frame AABB is `((px + minx_obj, py + miny_obj), (px + maxx_obj, py + maxy_obj))`.
           
           Based on the feedback I received, I re-examined the initial poses and the object shapes, as well as the surface v20. After that, I re-evaluated the proposed poses to ensure stability and decided to move each object's AABB inside by 0.001 to ensure the 'strictly less than/greater than' rule is honored.
           
           The initial feedback about object v18 caused some concern. The local AABB  `((-0.167, -0.376), (-0.075, -0.284))` had coordinates outside of what would fit the surface. To make matters worse, the calculated world AABB was quite different from the feedback AABB, which did not make sense. I believe there was a disconnect in how the local AABB values and placement are defined for these collision detections. I will, for this project, assume that the local AABB is more like a fixed sized set of dimensions and the object is then placed on the v20 surface.
           
           Here's the new plan with safer poses to guarantee object stability:
           
           *   **Object v8:** I am using `(-0.08, 0.08, 0.782, 0.0)` for this. The offset ensures a good amount of distance from the boundaries.
           *   **Object v12:** I am using `(0.08, -0.01, 0.782, 0.0)` for this, which ensures that it is placed slightly offset from the boundary of the surface.
           *   **Object v14:** The plan uses `(-0.08, 0.01, 0.782, 0.0)` as a placement to ensure the object is placed inside the boundary of the surface.
           *   **Object v16:** I am using `(-0.01, -0.08, 0.782, 0.0)` as a placement inside the surface.
           *   **Object v18:** I am using `(0.0, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0)` for this object.
           
           To prevent any further collision with other objects, all of the objects were re-positioned.  The pick and place poses from the initial planning stage will be used. As for the base configuration of the robot, I was able to verify that the configurations from the initial plan would work.
           
           Therefore, the only movement required will be to move the base configuration to #o3. I will make no changes to the pick and place actions, and keep the proposed configurations for #o2, #o3, and #o4.
