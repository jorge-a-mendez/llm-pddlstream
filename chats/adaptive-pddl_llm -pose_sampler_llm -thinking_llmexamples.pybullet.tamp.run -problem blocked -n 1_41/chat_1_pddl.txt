           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unachievable Goal: Analysis of `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with the goal of achieving `new-axiom@0()`, a very specific predicate.  My first instinct is to break it down.  `new-axiom@0()` boils down to two conditions:  `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.  I need to find an object,  `?green`, that satisfies both.
           
           A quick glance at the initial state and object list reveals that `v8` and `v12` both fit the `type(?green, v17)` condition. Now, the trick is to get either of them "on" `v18`.
           
           The `on` predicate is itself defined by an axiom: it requires an object to be `supported` by another *at a specific pose* and also be *at that pose*.  I've got to look at both `v8` and `v12` carefully.
           
           For `v8`, I see it *can* be supported by `v18` at pose `#o2`. But currently, it's on `v11` and `atpose(v8, v9)`. So I'd need to  `pick` it from `v11` (and `v9`) and then `place` it onto `v18` at `#o2`.  Same deal for `v12`: Currently on `v14` at `v13`, but *can be* on `v18` at `#o2`.
           
           This is where things get tricky.  The available action instances are alarmingly limited, just `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  That's just moving the robot's base. It's completely irrelevant to the goal: I need `pick` and `place` actions to manipulate objects and get either of my contenders onto `v18`.  
           
           The "list of valid action instances" clause is crucial. It means I *can only use* that one `move_base` action.  This is a significant constraint, and this strongly suggests the goal is unachievable given the restriction on valid actions.  I can move the robot's base around, but I can't actually pick up, move, or place any of the objects necessary to satisfy `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           My expert opinion is that this goal, under these conditions, is an impossibility.
