           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

           Alright, I've got a clear picture of what's required. The task is to generate 50 stable placements for an object with ID 5, dimensions 0.07 x 0.07, on surface 0, which is defined by the points ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  A stable placement means the object is fully contained within the surface. The placement is defined as a tuple (surf_idx, theta, x, y), where surf_idx is the surface index (0 in this case), theta is the rotation angle, and (x, y) are the object's center coordinates.
           
           Since the object is a square (0.07 x 0.07), its effective bounding box (AABB) will change with rotation. I need to calculate the valid (x, y) ranges for the object's center, given a rotation angle `theta`, to ensure it fits within the surface's boundaries. The surface dimensions are straightforward: 0.6 units wide and 0.6 units high. Given the object's dimensions and the surface size, I can expect plenty of valid placement combinations.
           
           The first step is to consider the extreme rotations: 0 and pi/4. The maximum AABB dimension occurs at 45 degrees. The smallest AABB dimension occurs at 0 degrees and any multiple of pi/2. I'll need to calculate the adjusted (x, y) bounds for each rotation.
           
           My strategy will be to generate a grid of x and y values for both 0 and 45 degree rotations to cover the most placement options and the most critical changes of bounding boxes.  I'll start by generating 25 placements at 0 degrees and another 25 at pi/4, giving me the requested 50 total placements.
           
           The x and y values will be evenly distributed within the valid ranges, which I'll calculate based on the bounding box size for each rotation. Then, generate the output as a simple list of (0, theta, x, y) tuples.
