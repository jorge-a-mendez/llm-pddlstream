User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.642, 0.051), (-4.546, 0.146)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.594, 0.098, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.259, 0.966).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The provided scene describes several objects, their poses, and their properties related to stacking and grasping. There are two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both are `handempty`. There are three graspable objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v15`.
           
           The goal is `(new-axiom@0)`. According to the axioms, `(new-axiom@0)` can be achieved if `(on ?green v18)` and `(type ?green v17)` are true. The object `v18` is an AABB representing a surface, specifically `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. The object `v17` is a type.
           
           From the initial state, we have:
           - `type(v12, v17)`
           - `type(v8, v17)`
           - `atpose(v8, v9)`
           - `atpose(v12, v13)`
           - `atpose(v15, v16)`
           - `supported(v8, v9, v11)`
           - `supported(v15, v16, v11)`
           - `supported(v12, v13, v14)`
           
           We need to make `on(?green, v18)` true for an object `?green` of type `v17`. Both `v8` and `v12` are of type `v17`. `v18` is a surface.
           
           Let's consider `v8` as `?green`. The current pose of `v8` is `v9`, which is supported by `v11`. We need to place `v8` on `v18`.
           For `on(v8, v18)` to be true, `atpose(v8, ?p)` and `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` must be true for some pose `?p`.
           We have `pose(v8, #o2)` and `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. So, if we place `v8` at `#o2`, the goal can be achieved.
           
           To achieve `atpose(v8, #o2)`:
           1. Pick `v8` from its current pose `v9`.
              - `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)` is available.
              - `atpose(v8, v9)` is true.
              - `handempty(v4)` is true.
              - `atbconf(v3)` is true.
              - No `unsafeapproach` or `unsafeatraj` for these parameters.
           2. Place `v8` at `#o2`.
              - `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` is available.
              - `atgrasp(v4, v8, #o1)` would be true after pick.
              - `atbconf(v3)` is true.
              - No `unsafepose`, `unsafeapproach`, or `unsafeatraj` for these parameters.
           
           The only action instance available is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This implies that the robot base does not need to move to perform the pick and place, or if it does, the motion is already precomputed as part of the `kin` parameters and the base starts and ends at the same configuration `v3`.
           
           The plan would involve picking `v8` from `v9` and placing it at `#o2`.
           
           --Plan--:
           (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           
           --Poses--:
           (#o2 v8 v18): (4.5 0.3 0.8 0.0)

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The current problem states that the only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. The goal `(new-axiom@0)` requires placing an object of type `v17` (either `v8` or `v12`) onto the surface `v18`. This involves pick and place operations, which are not available in the provided list of valid action instances. Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the given set of valid actions.
