           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unattainable: Lack of Necessary Actions**
           
           My analysis reveals that the objective, `new-axiom@0()`, is fundamentally unachievable given the provided constraints.  The goal requires satisfying several conditions, most notably the acquisition of images (`receivedimage`) and analyses (`receivedanalysis`).  These conditions can only be met through the actions `send_image` and `send_analysis`, respectively, as defined by the domain.
           
           However, a critical restriction prevents a successful plan: *Neither* of these crucial actions (`send_image` or `send_analysis`) is included in the list of permissible action instances. The problem statement explicitly states that only the provided actions can be used. Furthermore, the available actions (`move` and `drop_rock`) are not sufficient to modify the world state to achieve the goal conditions.
           
           While I have a thorough understanding of the initial state and the necessary preconditions for each action, and the implications of available configurations and rays, I cannot construct a plan to satisfy the goal as it's currently defined. I conclude that, due to the absence of the required `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, the problem is unsolvable with the given resources.
