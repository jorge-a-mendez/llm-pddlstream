           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 5) -- 0.08815450807362146, 0.08815450807362146)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27. The object is also square, with dimensions 0.088 x 0.088. This means the object is significantly smaller than the surface, allowing for many possible placements.
           
           To find stable placements, I need to ensure the object's bounding box stays within the surface's bounding box. Given the square nature of both, any rotation will keep the object's effective dimensions the same relative to its own center, simplifying the stability check.
           
           The surface is from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. The object has a half-size of 0.08815450807362146 / 2 = 0.04407725403681073.
           So, for the object to be fully contained, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.04407725403681073 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.04407725403681073
           -0.135 + 0.04407725403681073 <= y <= 0.135 - 0.04407725403681073
           
           This simplifies to:
           -0.09092274596318927 <= x <= 0.09092274596318927
           -0.09092274596318927 <= y <= 0.09092274596318927
           
           I will generate placements by varying x, y, and theta within these bounds. Since the object is square, rotation doesn't change its AABB extents, so any angle is equally valid. I'll use a mix of 0 and pi/2 for diversity in orientation.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have received a successful placement for object ID 5: `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. This means object 5 is placed at the center of surface 0, with no rotation. I need to consider this object 5 as a fixed obstacle when placing the new object, ID 4.
           
           The scene still contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27.
           The new object (ID: 4) is also square, with dimensions 0.09867152347071007 x 0.09867152347071007.
           Its half-size is 0.09867152347071007 / 2 = 0.049335761735355035.
           
           For object 4 to be contained within surface 0:
           -0.135 + 0.049335761735355035 <= x_4 <= 0.135 - 0.049335761735355035
           -0.135 + 0.049335761735355035 <= y_4 <= 0.135 - 0.049335761735355035
           
           This simplifies to:
           -0.08566423826464496 <= x_4 <= 0.08566423826464496
           -0.08566423826464496 <= y_4 <= 0.08566423826464496
           
           Now I must avoid collision with object 5.
           Object 5 (ID: 5) is placed at (0, 0, 0, 0) on surface 0.
           Its size is 0.08815450807362146 x 0.08815450807362146.
           Its AABB is from -0.04407725403681073 to 0.04407725403681073 in both x and y.
           
           To avoid collision, the AABB of object 4 cannot overlap with the AABB of object 5.
           Given that object 5 is centered at (0,0) and occupies a significant central area, I should place object 4 towards the edges of the available surface area, avoiding the central region. The combined half-widths of the two objects are 0.04407725403681073 (obj 5) + 0.049335761735355035 (obj 4) = 0.093413015772165765. This means their centers must be at least this distance apart in either x or y to avoid collision. Since both are squares and object 5 is at the origin, I should try to place object 4 such that its center's absolute value is greater than 0.04407725403681073 + 0.049335761735355035 = 0.093413015772165765, which is outside the bounds of the surface. This implies a direct side-by-side placement on the same central axis is not possible without overlap.
           
           Therefore, I need to place object 4 entirely outside the AABB of object 5. This means the x-coordinate of object 4's center should be greater than 0.04407725403681073 + 0.049335761735355035 = 0.093413015772165765 or less than -0.093413015772165765, or similarly for the y-coordinate. However, the available x and y ranges for object 4 are only up to 0.08566423826464496. This means object 4 cannot be placed directly adjacent to object 5 along a cardinal axis without overlap.
           
           Let's re-evaluate. The condition for collision of two axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) centered at (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) with half-extents (hx1, hy1) and (hx2, hy2) is:
           abs(x1 - x2) < (hx1 + hx2) AND abs(y1 - y2) < (hy1 + hy2).
           
           For object 5: center (0,0), hx5 = hy5 = 0.04407725403681073.
           For object 4: center (x4,y4), hx4 = hy4 = 0.049335761735355035.
           
           Collision avoidance requires:
           NOT ( abs(x4 - 0) < (0.04407725403681073 + 0.049335761735355035) AND abs(y4 - 0) < (0.04407725403681073 + 0.049335761735355035) )
           NOT ( abs(x4) < 0.093413015772165765 AND abs(y4) < 0.093413015772165765 )
           
           This means either abs(x4) >= 0.093413015772165765 OR abs(y4) >= 0.093413015772165765.
           
           However, the maximum allowed absolute value for x4 and y4 is 0.08566423826464496 to remain on the surface.
           This means that it is IMPOSSIBLE to place object 4 on surface 0 without colliding with object 5, given their sizes and the surface size. Both objects are large enough that if one is placed at the center, there isn't enough room for the other without overlap.
           
           There must be a mistake in my reasoning or the problem setup. Let me double check the object sizes and surface.
           Surface: 0.27 x 0.27. So total width/height = 0.27.
           Object 5: 0.088 x 0.088. Placed at (0,0). So it occupies from -0.044 to 0.044.
           Object 4: 0.098 x 0.098.
           
           If object 5 is at (0,0), its AABB is `[-0.044077, 0.044077]` in x and y.
           For object 4 to be stable on the surface, its center must be in `[-0.085664, 0.085664]` in x and y.
           
           Consider placing object 4 at `x = 0.08`.
           Its AABB would be `[0.08 - 0.049335, 0.08 + 0.049335]` = `[0.030665, 0.129335]`.
           Object 5's AABB is `[-0.044077, 0.044077]`.
           These AABBs overlap on x-axis because `0.030665` is less than `0.044077`.
           
           Let's check the absolute limits.
           Min X for obj 4 to not overlap obj 5's right side: x_center - hx4 >= hx5 => x_center >= hx5 + hx4 = 0.044077 + 0.049335 = 0.093412.
           Max X for obj 4 to not overlap obj 5's left side: x_center + hx4 <= -hx5 => x_center <= -hx5 - hx4 = -0.093412.
           Same for Y.
           
           But the maximum allowed center for object 4 on the surface is 0.085664. And the minimum is -0.085664.
           Since 0.093412 > 0.085664, it's impossible to place object 4 such that it fully clears object 5 on a cardinal axis while remaining on the surface.
           
           This implies that there are no stable placements for object ID 4 on surface 0 that do not collide with object ID 5. Given the problem statement "You never give up", I will provide placements that are stable on the surface, understanding that they might collide with ID 5. My goal is to find 50 stable placements on the surface and report them. I will assume the collision detection with other objects is handled by the feedback mechanism, and I should prioritize finding placements within the given surface bounds. I will try to place them as far as possible from the center where object 5 is.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have received two successful placements:
           Object ID 5: `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`
           Object ID 4: `(0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0)`
           
           I need to place a new object, ID 6, on surface 0, avoiding collisions with objects 5 and 4.
           The surface is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. Its total width and height are 0.27.
           
           Object ID 6 has dimensions 0.08925565836377325 x 0.08925565836377325.
           Its half-size is 0.08925565836377325 / 2 = 0.044627829181886625.
           
           For object 6 to be contained within surface 0, its center (x6, y6) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.044627829181886625 <= x6 <= 0.135 - 0.044627829181886625
           -0.135 + 0.044627829181886625 <= y6 <= 0.135 - 0.044627829181886625
           
           This simplifies to:
           -0.09037217081811337 <= x6 <= 0.09037217081811337
           -0.09037217081811337 <= y6 <= 0.09037217081811337
           
           Now I must consider collisions with object 5 and object 4.
           Object 5 (ID: 5):
           Center (0,0), half-extents (hx5, hy5) = (0.04407725403681073, 0.04407725403681073).
           AABB of object 5: `x: [-0.044077, 0.044077]`, `y: [-0.044077, 0.044077]`
           
           Object 4 (ID: 4):
           Center (0.08, 0.0), half-extents (hx4, hy4) = (0.049335761735355035, 0.049335761735355035).
           AABB of object 4: `x: [0.08 - 0.049335, 0.08 + 0.049335]` = `[0.030665, 0.129335]`
           `y: [-0.049335, 0.049335]`
           
           Object 6 (ID: 6):
           Center (x6, y6), half-extents (hx6, hy6) = (0.044627829181886625, 0.044627829181886625).
           
           Collision conditions for object 6 with object 5:
           `abs(x6) < (hx5 + hx6)` AND `abs(y6) < (hy5 + hy6)`
           `abs(x6) < (0.044077 + 0.044627)` AND `abs(y6) < (0.044077 + 0.044627)`
           `abs(x6) < 0.088704` AND `abs(y6) < 0.088704`
           
           Collision conditions for object 6 with object 4:
           `abs(x6 - 0.08) < (hx4 + hx6)` AND `abs(y6 - 0.0) < (hy4 + hy6)`
           `abs(x6 - 0.08) < (0.049335 + 0.044627)` AND `abs(y6) < (0.049335 + 0.044627)`
           `abs(x6 - 0.08) < 0.093962` AND `abs(y6) < 0.093962`
           
           The available range for x6 and y6 is `[-0.090372, 0.090372]`.
           
           Let's analyze the space.
           Object 5 is centered at (0,0). Its right edge is at x=0.044. Its left edge is at x=-0.044.
           Object 4 is centered at (0.08,0). Its left edge is at x=0.03. Its right edge is at x=0.129.
           
           This means there's a significant occupied region in the positive X direction (from -0.044 to 0.129 in X at Y=0).
           Specifically, the range `[0.030665, 0.044077]` is covered by both objects 4 and 5.
           Combined X range of occupied space: `[-0.044077, 0.129335]` for Y values near 0.
           
           Since the maximum x for object 6 is 0.090372 and minimum is -0.090372, placing object 6 in the range of `y = [-0.090, 0.090]` will be challenging.
           
           I need to find x6 such that:
           x6 > 0.044077 + 0.044627 = 0.088704 (to clear obj 5 right) AND x6 < 0.08 - (0.049335 + 0.044627) = 0.08 - 0.093962 = -0.013962 (to clear obj 4 left) -> Impossible.
           OR
           x6 < -0.044077 - 0.044627 = -0.088704 (to clear obj 5 left)
           And similar for Y.
           
           Let's try to place object 6 primarily in the negative X region, or away from Y=0.
           
           Trying a placement in negative x:
           Let x6 = -0.085. y6 = 0.
           Check collision with 5:
           abs(-0.085) = 0.085. 0.085 < 0.088704. This means it will collide with object 5 if y6 is also close to 0.
           So, if x6 is -0.085, y6 must be outside `[-0.088704, 0.088704]`. But the maximum allowed |y6| is 0.090372. This only leaves a very thin band for Y if x6 is this close.
           It seems incredibly tight. The problem "You never give up" implies I must find a solution. Let's try corners.
           
           Maybe the "non-fixed obstacle" from the previous round means that one of object 4 or 5 *was* in a different location than what I'm calculating. But the prompt says the listed successes are "placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles", which means their current positions are fixed and valid.
           
           Let's try to place object 6 far into the negative x, negative y corner.
           x6 = -0.090. y6 = -0.090.
           Is this within surface bounds? Yes, -0.090372 <= -0.090 <= 0.090372.
           Check collision with 5 (center 0,0, hx5=hy5=0.044077):
           abs(x6 - 0) = abs(-0.090) = 0.090. This is NOT < 0.088704. So no X overlap with object 5.
           Check collision with 4 (center 0.08,0, hx4=hy4=0.049335):
           abs(x6 - 0.08) = abs(-0.090 - 0.08) = abs(-0.170) = 0.170. This is NOT < 0.093962. So no X overlap with object 4.
           
           So, a placement like `(0, 0.0, -0.090, -0.090)` seems to clear both objects in X.
           Now I need 50 unique placements. I will try different angles and positions, prioritizing corners or edges away from the already placed objects.
           
           The placed objects are:
           Obj 5: AABB `[-0.044077, 0.044077] x [-0.044077, 0.044077]`
           Obj 4: AABB `[0.030665, 0.129335] x [-0.049335, 0.049335]`
           
           Let's look for pockets.
           The negative X, negative Y quadrant seems most open.
           Max x6 = 0.090372, Max y6 = 0.090372
           Min x6 = -0.090372, Min y6 = -0.090372
           
           For a placement to be valid in X (for obj 6 centered at x6), it must not overlap with obj 5's X range AND obj 4's X range.
           Obj 5 X range: `[-0.044077, 0.044077]`
           Obj 4 X range: `[0.030665, 0.129335]`
           
           Effective occupied X range for obj 6 to clear:
           Left of 5: x6 + hx6 <= -0.044077 => x6 <= -0.044077 - 0.044627 = -0.088704
           Right of 4: x6 - hx6 >= 0.129335 => x6 >= 0.129335 + 0.044627 = 0.173962 (Too large, max x6 is 0.090)
           Between 5 and 4? This is complex because their Y ranges overlap, and their X ranges slightly overlap (from 0.030665 to 0.044077).
           If y6 is far from 0:
           If x6 is between -0.044077 and 0.030665, it could avoid both if y6 is far enough.
           This is getting complicated. I'll stick to generating placements at the extremities of the surface for object 6, hoping they clear both.
           
           For example, `(-0.090, -0.090)` as checked above clears both in X. Let's check Y:
           For obj 6 (center -0.090, -0.090): y6 = -0.090. hy6 = 0.044627.
           AABB for obj 6: `x: [-0.1346, -0.0453]`, `y: [-0.1346, -0.0453]`
           
           Compare with obj 5 (AABB `[-0.044077, 0.044077] x [-0.044077, 0.044077]`)
           X: -0.0453 > -0.044077 is FALSE, so they don't overlap on X. (The max X of obj6 is less than min X of obj5 means they are completely to the left)
           Y: -0.0453 > -0.044077 is FALSE, so they don't overlap on Y either. (The max Y of obj6 is less than min Y of obj5 means they are completely below)
           Thus, `(-0.090, -0.090)` with rotation 0 is a stable, non-colliding placement.
           
           Let's find other places.
           What about `(0.0, -0.090)`?
           Obj 6 AABB: `x: [-0.0446, 0.0446]`, `y: [-0.1346, -0.0453]`
           Collides with 5 in X? Yes, `[-0.0446, 0.0446]` overlaps `[-0.044077, 0.044077]`.
           Collides with 5 in Y? No, `[-0.1346, -0.0453]` does not overlap `[-0.044077, 0.044077]`.
           So `(0.0, -0.090)` does *not* collide with object 5 (because of no Y overlap).
           
           Now check `(0.0, -0.090)` with object 4 (AABB `[0.030665, 0.129335] x [-0.049335, 0.049335]`)
           Obj 6 AABB: `x: [-0.0446, 0.0446]`, `y: [-0.1346, -0.0453]`
           Collides with 4 in X? Yes, `0.030665` is in `[-0.0446, 0.0446]`.
           Collides with 4 in Y? No, `[-0.1346, -0.0453]` does not overlap `[-0.049335, 0.049335]`.
           So `(0.0, -0.090)` does *not* collide with object 4 (because of no Y overlap).
           
           So `(0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.090)` is another valid placement!
           This strategy seems to be correct for this setup. I need to make sure both X and Y overlap conditions are met for a collision.
           
           I will generate placements for object 6, primarily focusing on areas with large absolute Y values and large absolute X values that are far from the existing objects.
           
           Valid Y range for obj 6 is `[-0.090372, 0.090372]`.
           Valid X range for obj 6 is `[-0.090372, 0.090372]`.

           I will stick to placements where at least one coordinate of obj 6's AABB is clearly outside the combined X/Y AABB of other objects.
           Revised plan: Focus on the corners where x and y are near the max/min.
           
           Let's try:
           x6: between [-0.090, -0.05] and [0.05, 0.090]
           y6: between [-0.090, -0.05] and [0.05, 0.090]
           
           (0, 0.0, -0.090, -0.090) # clears both
           (0, 0.0, -0.090, 0.090) # clears both
           (0, 0.0, 0.090, -0.090) # clears both

           What about `x6 = -0.090372` (max left) and `y6 = 0.0`?
           Obj 6 AABB x: `[-0.135, -0.0457]`
           Obj 5 AABB x: `[-0.044077, 0.044077]`
           Obj 4 AABB x: `[0.030665, 0.129335]`
           Obj 6 x-range does not overlap with obj 5 or obj 4.
           Obj 6 AABB y: `[-0.044627, 0.044627]`
           Obj 5 AABB y: `[-0.044077, 0.044077]`
           Obj 4 AABB y: `[-0.049335, 0.049335]`
           Obj 6 y-range overlaps with both obj 5 and obj 4.
           However, since there is no X overlap for obj 6 with obj 5 or obj 4, this placement will not collide.
           So `(0, 0.0, -0.0903, 0.0)` is a valid placement. Similarly `(0, 0.0, -0.0903, 0.0)` with pi/2 rotation.
           
           I'll fill out the remaining placements using similar logic, placing object 6 in the extremes of the surface, ensuring its AABB doesn't fully overlap with the AABBs of objects 4 and 5 in both X and Y.
