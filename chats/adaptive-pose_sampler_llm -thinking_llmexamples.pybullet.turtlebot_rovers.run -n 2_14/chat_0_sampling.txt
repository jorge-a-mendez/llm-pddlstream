           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's get this done. I need to generate 25 base positions for a robot, all aiming at a target point, and I've got a pretty good idea of how to approach this.**
           
           The target is at (0,0), and I'm constrained by a maximum range of 4 from that point, along with x and y limits of [-2.5, 2.5] (though, in practice, it's more like [-2.45, 2.45] due to the environment's boundaries).  I've also got a list of fixed rectangular obstacles to dodge.  Since the robot's orientation will automatically face the target, it boils down to finding those 25 valid (x,y) locations.
           
           My plan is to generate points in circular patterns around the target, varying the distance (radius) and angles.  The x=0 vertical wall is a massive constraint - it essentially splits the environment. The robot can't directly *be* on that axis.
           
           Looking at the obstacles, the rectangular walls define the primary usable workspace. Additionally, the list contains several other smaller obstacles scattered around. While the feedback system will warn of collisions, I'd prefer to minimize those obvious issues.
           
           Considering the crucial vertical wall (x=0) and the target at (0,0), the solution will be placing bases on each side of the wall. To address this, I will generate a number of points on both sides of the central wall.
           
           For the right side of the x=0 wall, I'll use radii (r) from 1.0 up to 2.4, and angles (theta) between -PI/3 to PI/3 and then check for occlusion (especially from obstacles 7, 9, 12, 14, 15, 17, 20).  I'll do the same for the left side, mirroring the coordinates. After this double-check, I came up with 12 points for the right and 13 for the left (since I realized that some positions near the vertical wall, with small x, were occluded) for a total of 25.

(Thoughts: **My Plan for Generating Diverse Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 25 robot base positions for a new target point at (1.0, 0.0).  Here's my thinking process:
           
           First, I need to make sure these positions meet several criteria: they must be within a maximum range of 4 from (1.0, 0.0), stay within the x: [-2.5, 2.5] and y: [-2.5, 2.5] boundaries, avoid fixed obstacles, maintain a clear line of sight to the target, and finally, offer a good variety of potential positions.
           
           Given my understanding of the environment, here's how I'm approaching this:
           
           1.  **Obstacle Analysis & Constraints:**
               *   I've identified the key obstacles, particularly the central wall at x=0. Since the target is at x=1.0, the robot base *must* be on the right side of this wall (x > 0.05) to avoid occlusion.
           
               *   This creates some immediate constraints. The *x* coordinate will always be in the range (0.05, 2.45] and the *y* coordinate will be constrained to the range [-2.45, 2.45]. Also, the distance from the robot base to the target should be less than or equal to 4.
           
           2.  **Strategic Point Generation:**
               *   I'm planning to use a combination of radial and grid-based approaches to get diverse coverage. I'll focus on locations near the target, as that's a key area to cover.
           
               *   For the radial approach, I will create points on concentric circles around the target and within the environment boundaries, being careful to avoid collisions with the known obstacles.
           
               *   For the grid-based approach, I will try to fill in spaces that were left in the circle-based approach.
           
           3.  **Specific Point Generation Strategies:**
           
               *   **Along the x-axis (y = 0):** This means I will pick points *x = 0.5, 1.5, 2.0, 2.4* where y=0.
           
               *   **Points Around the Target using Circles**
                   * I will pick some points around the target, and check to see that *x > 0.05* and that I don't collide with the fixed obstacles, and then create points with different angles and radii.
                   *   I will test radii of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0.
           
               *   **Obstacle Avoidance:**
                   *   I am considering fixed obstacles within the right half of the scene.
                   * I also need to make sure that these circles are free of line-of-sight collisions.
           
           4.  **Final Point Selection & Refinement:**
               *   I'll generate a list of candidate positions, apply the geometric, boundary, and line-of-sight constraints, and then iteratively select the 25 most diverse and valid positions. I'll remove any points that end up being too close to each other.
           
           With this systematic approach, I'm confident I can generate a useful set of diverse and obstacle-free base positions.
