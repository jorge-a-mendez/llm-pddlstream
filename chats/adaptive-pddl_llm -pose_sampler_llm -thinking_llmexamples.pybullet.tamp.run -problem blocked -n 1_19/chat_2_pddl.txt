(Thoughts: **Reasoning through the `Atom new-axiom@0()` Goal in pr2-tamp**
           
           Okay, so the task at hand is to generate a plan to satisfy the goal `Atom new-axiom@0()` within the `pr2-tamp` domain.  Looking at the definition,  `new-axiom@0()` is satisfied when both `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true.  Immediately, I know I need to find an object, which I'll call `?green`, that meets these criteria.  The initial state reveals that both `v12` and `v8` have the correct `type` (`type(v12, v17)` and `type(v8, v17)` are true). Therefore, I have two valid initial choices.
           
           Now, focusing on the `on` predicate.  The `on(?o, ?r)` axiom requires that `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)` be true.  I can quickly scan the initial state and see that both `v12` and `v8` are indeed supported on `v18` (`supported(v12, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` are true).  This means my plan hinges on getting either `v12` or `v8` to the correct `atpose`.  Currently, neither is where it needs to be.
           
           The plan will likely involve two actions. Let's say I choose `v12`.  I need to `place v12 at pose #o2` on `v18`. This requires `pick` action to pick `v12` from its current pose `v13` and `move_base`.
           
           Let's break down the preconditions. The `place` action has several preconditions, including `atgrasp`, `atbconf`, and the various `unsafe` assumptions. For now, I'll *assume* those `unsafe` preconditions are false, as is standard practice given the problem's setup. This seems reasonable.  The first action will be `move_base`, since the robot base `v3` does not have the target base configuration `#o3` (which is necessary for pick/place).  After moving the base, I can execute `pick`. The  `pick` preconditions all check out, and then finally I execute `place`. After this, `v12` should be `on v18`.
           
           So, the actions, in sequence: `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`, `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4`, and `place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`. It looks solid.
           
           Alternatively, I could repeat this process with `v8`, and the plan would be very similar. Both plans would be correct. I will stick with the v12 plan for now.
           
           It is always important to double-check the effects of actions, which look correct at a glance here: all of the goal requirements will become true, and the robot and object states will have changed as needed to reflect a valid goal state.
           
           After carefully reviewing the logic, the chosen plan looks appropriate. I can commit to this.
