           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 10) -- 0.08410027666035269, 0.0841002766603533)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation for Object 10**
           
           My objective is to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 10) on a given surface. This object is a square with dimensions 0.0841 x 0.0841. The surface is a rectangle defined by the points ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  A stable placement requires that the object's bounding box is fully contained within the surface. I will use surface index 0 for all placements.
           
           To ensure stability, I've calculated the valid range for the object's center coordinates (x, y). Given the surface and object dimensions, the valid x-range is approximately from 4.24205 to 4.75795, and the valid y-range is approximately from -0.55795 to -0.04205.
           
           To generate 50 unique placements, I've implemented a grid-based approach.  I've created a 10x5 grid within the valid x and y ranges. I then alternate the rotation angle (theta) between 0 and pi/4 radians. The object is a square so rotation doesn't change its AABB footprint, however the instructions say "taking into account the geometry of the object".
