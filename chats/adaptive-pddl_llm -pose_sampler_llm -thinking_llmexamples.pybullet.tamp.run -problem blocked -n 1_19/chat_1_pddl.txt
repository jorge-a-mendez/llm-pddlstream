           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Goal Breakdown**
           
           My primary objective is to achieve the state described by `new-axiom@0`, specifically getting an object, `?green`, both "on" `v18` and of "type" `v17`. Looking at the initial state, I see two viable candidates for `?green`: `v8` and `v12`. Both are type `v17` and stackable on `v18`.  Since I know that a supported object is on the support, achieving `on(v8,v18)` or `on(v12,v18)` would be needed.
           
           **Action Planning: Focusing on v8**
           
           I've decided to prioritize placing `v8` on `v18` as a possible strategy. Currently, `v8` is on `v11` (given `supported(v8, v9, v11)`. The plan requires me to move `v8` to `v18`, so I must move `v8` from `v11`.
           
           To achieve this, I need to execute two key actions:
           
           1.  **Pick:** Get the arm, `v4`, to pick up `v8` from its current pose. This involves finding a valid grasp and arm trajectory.
           
           2.  **Place:** Use the arm, `v4`, to place `v8` on `v18` at a known pose.
           
           **Detailed Action Instantiation and Preconditions**
           
           Here are the precise action instantiations and checks:
           
           1.  **Pick:** `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`.
               *   **Preconditions:**
                   *   `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`: Is true.
                   *   `atpose(v8, v9)`: Is true.
                   *   `handempty(v4)`: Is true.
                   *   `atbconf(v3)`: Given that `atbconf(v3)` is true and only that base position, and the available base configuration can move from v3 to v3, my interpretation is that `#o3` must be `v3`. This interpretation is further supported by the `kin` predicates, which require a valid robot configuration, implying that `#o3` and `v3` must be the same since no base movement actions are available.
                   *   No `unsafe` predicates are true.
           
           2.  **Place:** `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`.
               *   **Preconditions:**
                   *   `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`: True based on my interpretation of `#o3` being `v3`.
                   *   `atgrasp(v4, v8, #o1)`: Achieved by the `pick` action.
                   *   `atbconf(v3)`: Always true.
                   *   No `unsafe` predicates are true.
           
           **Goal Verification**
           
           After successful execution of both actions, `v8` will be at its final pose, `#o2`, on `v18` with all preconditions for my axioms met.
           
           The only other potentially available action that is not strictly necessary is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. Its effect doesn't improve the current state.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Goal's Reachability with Severe Action Constraints**
           
           I've been instructed to re-evaluate the plan, now that the user has clarified the valid actions. The previous plan contained invalid actions, so I need to construct a new one, strictly adhering to the permitted actions. The only valid action is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.
           
           The goal is `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which translates to needing an object, let's call it `?green`, which has a specific type and is located *on* a specific region, `v18`. That means I must find an object `?green` with the correct `type`, and then ensure `?green` is `on` `v18`.
           
           Examining the initial state, I see two objects, `v8` and `v12`, that possess the required type. The `on` predicate is derived from `supported` and `atpose`, so my next step is to see if I can move either `v8` or `v12` to a location supported by `v18`.
           
           For `v8`, I know `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`. Hence, `on(v8, v11)`. I also know `pose(v8, #o2)` and `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. If `v8` were `atpose(v8, #o2)`, my goal for `v8` would be satisfied. The problem? No action exists to change `atpose(v8, v9)` to `atpose(v8, #o2)`.
           
           The same logic applies to `v12`: `atpose(v12, v13)` and `supported(v12, v13, v14)` (thus `on(v12, v14)`) and `pose(v12, #o2)`, and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. If `v12` were `atpose(v12, #o2)`, the goal would be satisfied for `v12`. But again, no actions are available to alter `v12`'s pose.
           
           The only action I have is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This affects the base configuration but does *not* modify the position of any objects, `atpose` or `supported`. Therefore, this action is useless in achieving the goal.
           
           In short, there is no way to reach the goal with only the `move_base` action. Neither `v8` nor `v12` are currently `on v18`, and there are no valid actions available that would move either to a position on `v18`.
