           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 10) -- 0.08376579776429338, 0.08376579776429377)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Fulfilling the Request for 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to generate 50 stable placements for object ID 10, a square object with dimensions approximately 0.084 x 0.084, on surface 0. Surface 0 is a square with an extent defined by points ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  A "stable" placement necessitates that the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) remains entirely within the surface's AABB for a given rotation.
           
           Because the object is square, its effective AABB size varies with rotation. The maximum effective size occurs at 45-degree increments, increasing by a factor of the square root of 2, while the minimum is at 0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees.  I've determined that the maximum effective dimension is 0.118465.  The surface is a square of width and height 0.6.  Given the size of object, placement is definitely feasible, and the key is distribution of rotation and position to meet the request for diversity.
           
           For simplicity and to ensure an approach that is robust, I determined the smallest, safest rectangle within the surface by applying the maximum *half* effective dimension to each side.  This safest rectangle has these boundaries: x is bounded by 4.25923282 and 4.74076718; y is bounded by -0.54076718 and -0.05923282.
           
           I decided to create diversity by covering 5 different angles: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8 and pi/2.  I then took advantage of the safe region and determined a 5x2 grid within it. This distribution method should produce diverse (x, y) placements for each theta value.  With 5 angles, each point placed with a diverse position (on the safe rectangle), there are exactly 50 combinations in total, which I confirmed with code.
           
           In essence, I'm creating a grid of placement locations that is guaranteed to result in stable placements, and these are scattered throughout the surface with five different rotational orientations for diversity, fulfilling the request.
