           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning to Satisfy a New Axiom**
           
           My task is to devise a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which expands to the conjunction of `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.  I've identified that several objects, specifically `v8` and `v12`, are already of type `v17`. To satisfy the `on` predicate, I need an object that is both supported on and at pose `v18`. From the initial state, I know that if either `v8` or `v12` is at pose `#o2`, the goal will be achievable because both objects are supported by and can be placed on `v18`.
           
           Currently, `v8` is at pose `v9` and `v12` is at `v13`. The available actions are `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`. Since I'm simply manipulating object poses, `clean` and `cook` are irrelevant. The `move_base` action doesn't alter object poses, so I'll need to use `pick` and `place`.
           
           To achieve the goal, I've decided to move `v8`. The initial state is `atpose(v8, v9)` and my goal is `atpose(v8, #o2)`.  I will use these two actions to achieve the final pose:
           
           *   **Pick:** `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`.
           *   **Place:** `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`.
           
           These two actions will move v8 into the correct pose.
           
           *   Pick preconditions:
               *   `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
               *   `atpose(v8, v9)`
               *   `handempty(v4)`
               *   `atbconf(v3)`
               *   *Safe approach and trajectory assumptions*
           *   Place preconditions:
               *   `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
               *   `atgrasp(v4, v8, #o1)`
               *   `atbconf(v3)`
               *   *Safe pose, approach, and trajectory assumptions*
           
           If executed sequentially, these two actions will move the object and then achieve the goal. No move base action is required since the robot is at its base configuration and any pick/place action will re-assert `canmove()`.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment: Unachievable Goal with Given Actions**
           
           Okay, so I see the problem. The user pointed out the prior plan used invalid actions, so I'm restricted to just `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which breaks down into needing an object, let's call it `?green`, to be `on` something else.  From the initial state, either `v8` or `v12` could be `?green`. I'll assume `v8`.
           
           The `on` predicate means `?green` needs to be supported *and* at the correct pose.  I see `v8` is already supported *but* its `atpose` is `v9`, not the desired `#o2`.
           
           Now, here's the kicker: I only have `move_base`.  This action seems... odd.  According to the provided definition, `move_base`'s *only* effect, other than setting `canmove()` to false, is a self-contradiction: it *both* adds and deletes `atbconf(v3)`.  In PDDL, that's effectively a no-op concerning `atbconf(v3)`. The intent is for the base to not actually move. It can't possibly change an object's pose, the very thing I need to do to achieve the `on` predicate.
           
           So, either there's a typo in the action definition, this is a placeholder, or there's a serious misunderstanding of the task.  `move_base` can't do what I need. The goal requires manipulating objects' poses, and I don't have the required `pick` and `place` actions.  Therefore, with the given action set, this goal is *unachievable*.  I'm effectively stuck with a Rubik's Cube where I can only rotate one face: the cube won't be solved.
