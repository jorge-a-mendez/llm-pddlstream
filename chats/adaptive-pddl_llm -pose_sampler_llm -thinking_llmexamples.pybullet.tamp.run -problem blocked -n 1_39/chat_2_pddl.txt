           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Goal and Analysis:**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan to achieve the goal `Atom new-axiom@0()` within the `pr2-tamp` domain.  I understand that `new-axiom@0()` represents having an object of a certain type (`v17`) on a specific receptacle (`v18`).  This immediately suggests I need to find an object that meets these criteria.
           
           **Initial State Examination:**
           
           I carefully examined the provided initial state, paying close attention to the objects and their properties. I noted that both `v8` and `v12` are of the necessary type (`v17`) and are also stackable on `v18`.  Since both options exist, I will need to pick one to achieve the goal.
           
           **Focusing on a Solution:**
           
           I noticed `v8` is currently supported at `v11` and `v12` is supported at `v14`.  I decided that, to reach my goal, I will have to place either `v8` or `v12` on `v18`.  I chose `v8` as my focus, meaning I need to move it.
           
           **Action Planning and Preconditions:**
           
           I looked for actions that allow this and selected `pick` and `place` actions.  I made sure to select the correct object, robot arm, grasps, poses, and configurations. I then carefully considered the preconditions for these actions, notably that the robot's base configuration must be in the correct position for picking and placing.
           
           **Base Movement and Configuration:**
           
           I recognized the need to move the robot's base to achieve the goal.  I identified the required `move_base` action and confirmed that the robot is currently at `v3`, but that picking and placing need a base configuration of `#o3`.
           
           **Plan Refinement and Validation:**
           
           I realized that `move_base` can cause `canmove()` becoming false, thus preventing a subsequent `pick` action. But I also saw that the `pick` action has `canmove()` as its effect, and it doesn't need it as a precondition. Thus, I planned for `move_base`, then `pick`, then `place`.
           
           **Full Plan Construction and Evaluation:**
           
           My final plan encompasses three distinct steps: 1) Move the robot's base to the required configuration (`#o3`). 2) Pick up object `v8` from its current supported surface `v11`. 3) Place object `v8` onto the receptacle `v18` at pose `#o2`. I confirmed that all preconditions for the selected actions are met and the goal is achieved.
