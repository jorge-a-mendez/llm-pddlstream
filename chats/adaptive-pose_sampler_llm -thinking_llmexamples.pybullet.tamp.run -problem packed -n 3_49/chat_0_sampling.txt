(Thoughts: **Object Placement on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, I've got this. The goal is to get 50 stable placements of Object 5, which is a square with side length ~0.0757, onto Surface 0, a square from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  Stability means the object's bounding box is entirely within the surface's.  I need to figure out valid center coordinates (x, y) and rotations (theta) to achieve this.
           
           Since it's a square, things are simpler than with a general object. The critical point is the *half* the object's dimension, which is about 0.0378.  For a theta of 0 (aligned) or pi/2 (rotated 90 degrees), the bounding box is a square of size 0.0757.  So, I calculate the allowed ranges for x and y.  It’s simply the surface's extents, minus this half-dimension on each side. Therefore, a valid x is in the range of -0.097155 to 0.097155 and the same range for y.
           
           Since the object is a square, I can use 0 and pi/2 to achieve two unique orientations that cover the board. Any other angle wouldn't increase the total board coverage. I’ll make a 5x5 grid of center points within the calculated range, which generates 25 points. With these x/y combinations, I can assign theta = 0 for the first 25 placements. I assign theta = pi/2 for the next 25 and, done. I think that covers a reasonable distribution within the surface.

(Thoughts: **Collision Avoidance Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. I've successfully placed object 5, and now I need to place object 4 without them colliding, given the surface constraints. I've got the dimensions and placement data for both objects and the surface. My strategy will be:
           
           1.  **Define the safe placement region for object 4 on the surface, ignoring object 5.** This involves calculating the limits based on the surface size and object 4's dimensions. I'll need to account for both x and y. I'll also pre-calculate the half extents of the object's dimensions to reduce future calculations.
           
           2.  **Exclude the area occupied by object 5 from the safe region.**  I'll use the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of the already placed object 5 to define its occupied space. I will have to recalculate object 5's AABB based on its center and dimensions to avoid any errors in coordinates, now the dimensions are known. Then, I need to adjust the safe placement area for object 4 so there's no overlap. This means ensuring object 4 is positioned either entirely to the right and/or above object 5. This will be the main part of the planning.
           
           3.  **Generate placements within the remaining safe region.** I will create a grid of placement locations for object 4 within the safe area. I'll make sure to place object 4 at a distance of its half extent to the pre-placed object 5. The total number of placements should be 50. I will generate a 5x5 grid with `theta=0` for the first 25 placements, and a 5x5 grid with `theta=pi/2` for the second 25 placements.
           
           I am now ready to run the calculations and generate the placement candidates.

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my plan.** I need to find 50 stable locations for a new square object (ID 6) on a surface, making sure it doesn't collide with two existing square objects (IDs 4 and 5). I have the surface's boundaries and the precise bounding boxes (AABBs) and positions of the existing objects.
           
           I've carefully calculated the AABBs for the existing objects and realized they are placed adjacent to each other, forming an "L" shape. This significantly restricts where I can place the new object. The new object is a square of fixed size.
           
           My main strategy will be to avoid overlapping with the "L" shape. This means finding safe regions for the center of the new object (ID 6).
           
           I calculated the valid region for the new object's center considering only the surface bounds and got a very thin right and top strip. The object's center has to be far enough from both the right and the top edge. I can safely use this region to place the center of the object 6 and the corresponding object rotation.
           I plan on placing the new objects on the very top and very right. I'm going to create evenly spaced placements along those lines.
           Because all the objects have the same size, it turns out that I can generate placements only in the top and right strip of the existing surface.
           I will place the objects in 25 placements in the top strip and another 25 in the right strip. I have calculated coordinates using the top and right strip. I will use `theta=0` for all 50. Since the objects are squares, using `theta=0` or `theta=pi/2` will generate the same AABB anyway.
