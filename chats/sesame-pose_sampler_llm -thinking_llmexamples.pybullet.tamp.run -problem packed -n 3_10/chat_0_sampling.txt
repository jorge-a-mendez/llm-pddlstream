           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Here's how I'm thinking about generating 50 stable placements:**
           
           My goal is to position object ID 5, a nearly-square shape with dimensions roughly 0.075 x 0.075, onto surface 0, which is a square region of side 0.27, ensuring the placements are stable. Stability here means the object is fully inside the surface and doesn't collide with anything else.  Since there are no obstacles or pre-placed objects, containment is my main concern.
           
           I need to calculate the allowable range for the object's center coordinates (x, y) given the object's dimensions and the surface size, also considering the rotation, theta. The object is a rectangular AABB. I'm focusing on two primary rotations: 0 and pi/2 radians (90 degrees). At these angles, the object's extents are straightforward to calculate; it's just half the width and half the height.  I know to ensure containment, the center of the object can't go closer than half of its extent to any surface edge.
           
           Since the object's width and height are so close, I'm finding the bounds for theta=0 and pi/2 is the same.  I'm using the surface limits of -0.135 and 0.135 and object's extents 0.037385 to find the range.  So, I can create a conservative range for the x and y coordinates of the center position from -0.097 to 0.097.
           
           To get the 50 placements, I'll use a 5x5 grid (25 positions) for both the 0 and pi/2 rotation. This gives me a nice spread across the surface area. I'll make a list of 25 placements at theta=0 and 25 at theta=pi/2. Each placement is a tuple containing the surface index, rotation angle and the x, y coordinates.

(Thoughts: **My Analytical Approach to Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback indicating a successful placement of object ID 5. Now, it's time to tackle object ID 4, which is similar in shape but slightly larger. I've been given its dimensions: width = 0.09839 and height = 0.09839. This object has to be placed on surface 0, which is a square surface defined as `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. My goal is to find 50 stable placements for object 4 without it colliding with object 5, which has already been placed.
           
           First, I need to understand the constraints for placing object 4. Since the object has these specific dimensions, I calculate the allowed center positions to ensure it's fully within the bounds of surface 0. Using the half-extents of `w4/2` and `h4/2`, I determined the allowed center range must be within approximately `[-0.0858, 0.0858]`.
           
           Now, considering the collision aspect. Object 5 is located at (-0.09, -0.09) and the given object 5 dimensions. I calculate its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) and determine the AABB region object 5 occupies on surface 0: `[-0.127385, -0.052615]` x `[-0.127385, -0.052615]`.
           
           To avoid overlap, the AABB for object 4 can't intersect Object 5's AABB. I then derive four conditions to maintain stability and avoid collision, such as Object 4 must either be positioned right, above, or partially overlap in the dimension opposite to that of the colliding dimension. I then calculate those coordinates and determine it's easier to satisfy the conditions if the AABB of object 4 satisfies condition 2 or condition 4.
           This provides the basis for my grid generation. I opted for a 6x6 grid over a range `[-0.08, 0.08]` for the object.
           
           Since it is essential that placements are stable and no collision occurs, I am generating the first set of placement locations using a grid with the collision condition. I set a grid of `x` and `y` coordinates to `[-0.08, -0.048, -0.016, 0.016, 0.048, 0.08]`.
           
           Now, to determine the stable positions, a check is performed to see if the positions selected satisfy the conditions to avoid collision: either the x or y coordinate of the bounding box should be great or equal to -0.00342. In this case, I will also have to consider the rotation, i.e., theta.
           After the first round of the generated positions for theta equals 0, the total amount of available position locations is 27. It is not enough.
           
           Then I set to generate the second set of locations for `theta` = `pi/4`, considering the object's Bounding Box would now be smaller at the rotated configuration. I used a smaller range of `[-0.06, 0.06]` to generate another grid set.  After a similar calculation, I was able to generate another 16 locations.
           I'll select a total of 50 non-colliding locations from the list of placements for my final results.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID: 6) on Surface 0, ensuring it doesn't collide with existing objects (ID: 5 and ID: 4). I've meticulously defined the scene and object dimensions, including Surface 0 boundaries, the positions, and sizes of the existing objects, and the dimensions of the new object.
           
           I begin by calculating the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for the existing objects. This involves determining the range of x and y coordinates each object occupies, considering their placements. I then calculate the surface boundaries where the new object can be placed.
           
           My key strategy is to consider a grid of valid placements for the object's center. I perform collision checks using the object's AABB. I've formulated a function to detect overlaps between the AABBs of the new object and the existing ones. Using the coordinates calculated from the bounds, I ensure the new object does not overlap with existing objects in my grid. Given the shape of the new square object, and the positions of existing objects, I generate possible `(cx, cy)` points to place the new object. 
           
           I've determined that placements where the x-coordinate of the new object's center is greater than or equal to 0.01 will not collide with the existing objects, regardless of the y-coordinate. Therefore, I can generate 50 valid placements simply by using 5 values for the x coordinate in the range [0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09] and 10 values for the y coordinates [-0.09, -0.07, -0.05, -0.03, -0.01, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09]. Each point on this grid of points produces a successful, non-colliding placement, allowing me to find exactly 50 placements.
