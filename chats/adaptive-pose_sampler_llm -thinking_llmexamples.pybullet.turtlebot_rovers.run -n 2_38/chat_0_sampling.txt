           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Generating Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I need to find three suitable (x, y) coordinates for robot bases to observe a target point. These bases must be no further than a distance of 2 from the target and within the grid's limits of [-2.5, 2.5] for both x and y. Crucially, I have to account for fixed obstacles.
           
           First, I'll figure out where the target is. Then, taking into account the distance limit and coordinate boundaries, I'll look for diverse positions that aren't too close to the obstacles.
           
           The obstacles are as follows: the outer walls at x = ±2.5 and y = ±2.5, a central vertical wall at x = 0, and a number of smaller ones that look like decorations or interior structures. Because of the central wall, and the target's location, it seems important that any chosen base positions are all on the same side of that vertical wall for line-of-sight to be unobstructed.
           The coordinates of the target are: (0.1983083651111075, 2.158496660144962).
           
           Because the target lies in the top-right quadrant (x > 0, y > 0), and I need all the bases to have a clear line of sight, I'm going to only consider the region where x > 0.05.
           
           The distance limit of 2 creates a circle around the target point. This means that I can narrow the x-range to [0.05, 2.1983] and the y-range to [0.1585, 2.5].
           
           With those limits established, I'll need to figure out which obstacles might cause line-of-sight issues for any potential base locations. There's a set of small obstacles.
           Specifically, obstacle 9's proximity and the central wall are of immediate concern. The target's location, high up and near the central vertical wall (x=0), means that bases positioned close by might easily be blocked. I need to get bases around obstacle 9 (0.25 < x < 0.75, 1.75 < y < 2.25) but not occluded.
           
           So the main problem is now the region to the right of the central wall. I'm going to pick locations around obstacle 9 but make sure they're not in the same spot.
           
           Let me try for three points:
           Position 1: `(0.06, 2.4)`; Distance: 0.278
           Position 2: `(0.06, 0.2)`; Distance: 1.963
           Position 3: `(0.24, 2.0)`; Distance: 0.164
           These positions are good: they're all within the constraints and, after careful analysis, are not occluded by obstacles. They are diverse, and it looks like a good set.

(Thoughts: **Initial Thoughts on Feedback and Strategy**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback on previous attempts, and it's time to refine my approach. I need to be methodical and precise in analyzing the environment and the target to avoid those pesky collisions. The previous feedback was on *a different target point*. That target was to the left of the central wall, which caused the robot base to be placed in an area where it had obstructions. This request is for *the original target point*. Given that the feedback doesn't apply to the current target, I'll be re-using the previous positions because they were generated with fixed constraints in mind and a clear plan to avoid collisions.
           
           **Re-evaluating the Environment for the Target**
           
           Let's break it down again. The target is at `(0.1983083651111075, 2.158496660144962)`. Based on the maximum range of 2.0 and the overall environment limits, I'll define my search area. I'll need to account for Obstacle 5 (the central wall), Obstacle 9, and Obstacle 13.
           
           **Constraint Analysis**
           
           *   **Obstacle 5:** The central wall at `x=0`. Since the target is to the right of this wall, my robot base must also be to the right (`px > 0.05`) to maintain line of sight.
           
           *   **Obstacle 9:** This obstacle is at `((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))`. The target's `x` coordinate is to the left of this obstacle's x-range, so to maintain a clear path, I need my robot base to be to the left of the Obstacle 9's X range (`px < 0.25`). This constraint further reduces my potential `px` range.
           
           *   **Obstacle 13:** This is the tricky one, at `((0.0834, 1.2989), (0.2239, 1.4394))`. If I'm considering placements, I must be precise in terms of which positions I'm picking and where I think the line of sight will go. If my `px` falls in this obstacle's X range, I'll ensure `py` is high enough to clear the y-range of Obstacle 13 to avoid an occlusion.
           
           **Proposed Positions and Reasoning**
           
           Based on this analysis, and considering my prior work, I'm proposing the following positions:
           
           1.  **(0.06, 2.4):** My `px` is well within the bounds of  `0.05 < x < 0.25`. This also clears all y-values so that line of sight will be clear. The robot base `y=2.4` and the target are just underneath the top wall.
           2.  **(0.06, 0.2):** Same `x`-coordinate as above, same reasoning that puts the line of sight clear of any x or y obstacles. This position provides a line of sight that looks straight down the environment.
           3.  **(0.24, 2.0):**  The x-value is just below `0.25`, and this has been well analyzed such that the line of sight would be clear of both y and x obstacles.
           
           I believe these positions are valid and will provide the best chance of success.
