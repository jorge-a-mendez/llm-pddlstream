           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable Due to Configuration Lockdown**
           
           My analysis reveals that the primary goal, `new-axiom@0()`, is fundamentally unattainable given the provided action set and initial state.  The core problem stems from the rigid constraints on the rovers' configurations.
           
           To achieve the goal, I must satisfy conditions related to receiving images and analyses. This requires the rovers to take images, analyze rocks, and send their data.  However, each of these actions—`calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`—demands that a rover be at a specific *configuration* (like `#o3`, `#o0`, or `#o5`).
           
           Initially, rover `v12` is at configuration `v13` and rover `v14` is at configuration `v15`.  The critical issue is the severely limited action set. The permitted `move` actions are no-ops: they simply allow the rovers to *remain* at their current configurations ( `v12` stays at `v13`, and `v14` stays at `v15`). The only other actions are `drop_rock`, which cannot be executed since neither rover has a full store.
           
           Since the rovers are locked in place and can't reach the required configurations for image capture or analysis, the parts of the goal requiring image reception and analysis are definitively unreachable.  Therefore, the overall goal cannot be met.
