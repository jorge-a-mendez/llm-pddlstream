User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.207, 0.534, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.88, 0.475).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.08, -0.457, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.925, -0.381).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.256, 0.485), (-0.159, 0.582)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.13, -0.506), (-0.031, -0.407)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.195, -0.539, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.968, 0.25).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.242, -0.587), (-0.147, -0.491)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom graspable(v12)

           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene consists of three graspable objects: v12, v14, and v8. There are three surfaces for placement: v10, v11, and v16. Objects v12, v14, and v8 are currently on surface v11, at poses v13, v15, and v9 respectively. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, both currently empty. The goal is to place all three objects (v8, v12, and v14) on surface v16.
           
           Since there are no pick and place actions available, and the only available action is a `move_base` that moves the robot from `v3` to `v3` using `traj #o0`, it implies that the robot cannot interact with the objects to achieve the goal. All objects are currently supported by `v11` and the goal is to move them to `v16`. Without any `pick` or `place` actions, it is impossible to move the objects. Therefore, the goal is not achievable.
