           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.243, -0.432, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.914, -0.406).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The task is to move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) onto the surface v20. All objects are currently supported on v11, with the exception of v12 which is on v11. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, both are at their home configurations and are empty. The only available action is `move_base v3 v3 #o0` which effectively means the robot is already at the correct base configuration and does not need to move. Since there are no `pick` or `place` actions available, it means the robot cannot interact with the objects. Therefore, the goal cannot be achieved.
           
           The goal is to move all five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) onto the `v20` surface. In the initial state, all these objects are supported on `v11`. To achieve the goal, the robot needs to pick up each object and place it on `v20`. However, looking at the provided action instances, only a `move_base` action is available. There are no `pick` or `place` actions available to manipulate the objects. Without these actions, the robot cannot pick up the objects from `v11` and place them on `v20`. Therefore, the goal is not achievable given the current set of available actions.
