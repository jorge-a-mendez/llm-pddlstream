           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Unreachable Goal**
           
           My primary objective is to formulate a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This goal necessitates fulfilling several conditions: acquiring images of two objectives, receiving analyses of both a stone and soil type, and maintaining certain rover configurations and store availability.
           
           Upon examination, I've determined that the initial state already satisfies a portion of the goal: the rovers are at their specified configurations, and the store is free on both rovers. This suggests that achieving the image and analysis components are the crux of the challenge.
           
           **Detailed Analysis of Goal Requirements**
           
           Breaking down the goal into its core components:
           
           *   **Image Acquisition:** This requires `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`. These are achieved through a sequence involving calibration (`calibrate`), image capture (`take_image`), and image transmission (`send_image`).
           *   **Analysis:**  The requirement involves receiving analyses for a stone and soil type (`receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`). This is accomplished via rock sampling (`sample_rock`) and analysis transmission (`send_analysis`).
           
           **Plan Formulation and Obstacles**
           
           To satisfy the image goals, I would need to devise a plan:
           
           1.  Calibrate the camera.
           2.  Take images.
           3.  Send the images.
           
           Parallelizing this to reduce the length of the plan will be preferred.
           
           Similarly, achieving the analysis goals involves:
           
           1.  Perform the sample.
           2.  Transmit the results.
           
           However, the key issue arises from the explicitly limited action set provided. The only *allowed* action instances are two "move" actions (which keep rovers in the same configuration) and two "drop_rock" actions. The image and analysis actions are not among the allowed action instances.
           
           Specifically, the "move" action does not actually move the rovers (the state before and after the action is the same). The "drop_rock" actions are already permissible given the initial state's free store conditions. The key is in the "take_image" "sample_rock" "send_image" and "send_analysis".
           
           **Conclusion: Goal is Unreachable**
           
           Because the necessary actions (`calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`) required for image and analysis components of `new-axiom@0()` are *excluded* from the list of valid action instances, it is impossible to construct a valid plan. Therefore, the goal is definitively *unreachable* given these constraints.
