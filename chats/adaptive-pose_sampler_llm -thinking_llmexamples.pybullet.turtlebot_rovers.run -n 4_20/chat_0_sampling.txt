User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Summary of Thoughts on Robot Base Positions**
           
           My objective is to generate three suitable (x, y) coordinates for the robot's base, given a specific target point. These base positions must adhere to several constraints: they must be within a maximum distance of 2 from the target, they must be within the overall workspace boundaries of x: [-2.5, 2.5] and y: [-2.5, 2.5], and they must avoid any known fixed obstacles. The robot's orientation will automatically be set to face the target.
           
           I've carefully considered the provided obstacles, which include the workspace boundaries and several other rectangular obstacles of various sizes. My strategy involves generating candidate positions around the target point, within the allowed distance, and then filtering these candidates to ensure they meet all the constraints. This filtering process includes checking that positions are within the specified workspace, calculating the distance to the target, and verifying that the positions don't collide with the fixed obstacles. Since I am only given AABBs, line-of-sight is something the simulator is responsible for and I will just try and place positions in open areas.
           
           For the given target point (0.244, 0.444), I've determined that the following positions are promising candidates:
           
           1.  (2.144, 0.444)
           2.  (0.244, -1.456)
           3.  (-1.656, 0.444)
           
           These positions are designed to provide a diverse set of options, covering a range of possible viewpoints relative to the target while avoiding known obstacles and remaining within the constraints of the problem.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **The Situation**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. We've got the same target as before: (-1.851, 2.1436), which sits right in the top-left area. The past attempts showed that sticking to the right side of the central wall (x=0) is a dead end. That's a crucial takeaway.
           
           Now, considering these obstacles, the user pointed out that any target inside, or near an obstacle, needs to be handled cautiously.  I'm interpreting that if a target is *inside* an obstacle, it doesn't count as occluded to that target from the perspective of the robot base; or maybe it's just considered the target *is* part of that obstacle in terms of this problem.
           
           I've got three new positions I'm proposing:
           1.  **(-1.656, 0.444)**:  I'm reusing this position, since it wasn't explicitly rejected before.
           2.  **(-2.3, 1.0)**: This one is to the left and slightly below the target, giving a different angle.
           3.  **(-1.851, 0.2436)**: This one is directly below the target area, providing a head-on view.
           
           **Reasoning:**
           
           The central wall is a problem. The user's feedback makes it clear to keep the robot on the left.
           I'm assuming the "line of sight" rule is a bit special when it comes to the obstacle the target is in. Since they are inside the main obstacle, I'm assuming that line of sight goes through.
           
           These new positions are all within the bounds and have an appropriate distance from the target (within the radius of 2).
           
           All right. I'm going in!
