User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Navigating the Scene: Finding Optimal Robot Positions**
           
           Alright, here's the game plan: I need to pinpoint three optimal spots for a robot base relative to a target point. The target's location is known, and these base positions must meet some key criteria. First, they need to be within a maximum distance (2 units) from the target. Next, they need to be within the 2D workspace defined by `x` and `y` coordinates (between -2.5 and 2.5). Oh, and a critical detail: the robot's orientation will automatically be set to face the target.
           
           Now, here's where it gets interesting: I've been given a list of obstacles. These obstacles are AABBs (axis-aligned bounding boxes), which I must avoid. This means no collisions! But it also means ensuring a clear "line-of-sight" (LOS) to the target. So, these spots I generate can't be *obstructed* by these fixed AABBs. I'm after a diverse set of positions that are free of collisions, and free of occlusions.
           
           First, I've got to break down the obstacles. I'm working with a rectangular environment defined by the large AABBs. Obstacle 0 defines the outer boundary, which I won't use for collision, but the subsequent ones are solid obstacles. There is a vertical wall at x=0 (Obstacle 5) that divides the space.
           
           The small obstacles are also key. These are also AABBs, and they are located in various regions of the space. My task is going to be to make sure that these obstacles do not block the robot's view of the target. To tackle this, I'm going to need to implement some key functions:
           
           1.  A function to check if a point is within the coordinate bounds I need to work in.
           2.  A distance function, so that I can make sure I'm not placing the base too far from the target.
           3.  A collision function that tells me if the base position collides with the obstacles.
           4.  A line of sight function that makes sure I have a clear view to the target.
           
           I'll be using the `is_point_in_aabb` and `segment_intersects_aabb` to solve these checks. The AABB data structure will be `((min_x, min_y), (max_x, max_y))`.
           
           When the target's at the center (0,0), it's a tricky one! Since there's that central dividing wall, I've got to get clever.  I'll start by checking the side the target is on.
           
           Now, my initial calculations show that `target = (0,0)` is a real challenge for LOS if the target is considered "within" the dividing wall.  The rules state that I will be provided with feedback, if the position "collides" or "has no line of sight", so I'll be working with a system that has some edge cases to resolve.
           
           Based on the problem setup, for the specific target `(0.0, 0.0)`, there are likely specific conditions in the scene definition. I need to assume that the the line of sight for the target point will be possible because no matter the position the line of sight calculation is being triggered. I will design the solution based on the information provided and my understanding.
           
           I am designing a LOS checker, and a collision checker, and a test setup, so I believe these positions will give me the information and conditions I need to provide the positions.
           
           I will then use the function I've built to filter and refine the positions, always trying to find a solid solution.
