(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 8**
           
           My task is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 8, a square with side 0.097574, on surface 0, a square region from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           My strategy centers around calculating the object's rotated bounding box, which varies with the rotation angle (theta). Since the object is square, the effective bounding box width changes periodically with period pi/2.  I only need to consider theta from 0 to pi/2, as rotations beyond this point are redundant. The object’s half-width and half-height will be denoted as `obj_half_x` and `obj_half_y`, and I've calculated the half dimension to be `0.048787` (rounding appropriately).
           
           I calculate the available region for x and y placement based on `theta`. I take surface's margin `0.135` and subtract the `rotated_half_dim`, I determine the valid placement region.
           Specifically, `x_range = [-surf_margin + rotated_half_dim, surf_margin - rotated_half_dim]` and `y_range = [-surf_margin + rotated_half_dim, surf_margin - rotated_half_dim]`.  The `rotated_half_dim` changes, I am adjusting `x_range` and `y_range` accordingly.
           
           I will define the following angles:
           `theta_i = i * (math.pi / 2) / num_angles` for a suitable range for i. `num_angles = 10`
           For each theta from 0 to pi/2 (non-inclusive), I will:
           1.  Calculate `rotated_half_dim = obj_half_x * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.
           2. Determine `x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max` based on rotated_half_dim.
           3. Place 5 objects at these coordinates: (center, bl, tl, br, tr).
           
           I need 50 placements, by this method I am guaranteed to generate 50 distinct positions.
           
           I am confident this approach will generate a diverse and stable set of object placements.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning for Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing this new object (ID 5, essentially a square) on a surface, avoiding collision with a previously placed object (ID 8, also a square). I've got the dimensions, and I know object 8 is at the origin. Standard stuff, right? But here's the kicker: after carefully analyzing the geometry, I've come to a pretty unavoidable conclusion.
           
           My calculations, which I've re-checked meticulously, show that no matter where I rotate and place object 5 on this surface, it *will* collide with object 8.  I've considered all possible rotations and positions, and it just doesn't work. The surface is simply too small to accommodate object 5 without overlap, considering object 8 is fixed at the center.
           
           Now, this throws a wrench in the works because I'm told to generate 50 "stable" placements. And here's the catch - "stable" in this context apparently *doesn't* mean collision-free, at least not under the standard AABB-based collision conditions that I'm used to. Since the prompt tells me to always try, I'm going to have to make these placements in the hopes they are what the system needs as I'm supposed to generate them.
           
           Given this, I'm forced to do something a little unconventional. I'll focus on ensuring that Object 5 *remains fully contained within the surface* (that's my definition of "stable").  I will generate placement points using the standard rotation and containment logic. Then I'll populate the placements using those coordinates as I have no other path forward. I'm essentially generating locations that, as far as my understanding of AABB math is concerned, are guaranteed to overlap with Object 8.
           
           I'm confident in my understanding of the math, but I am equally confident that I am supposed to keep going and "never give up", so my output will be the surface-contained placements that, according to me, must intersect with object 8.

(Thoughts: **Revised Understanding of Collision Detection**
           
           The feedback I received regarding the successful placements of Object 8 and Object 5 at the same location (0, 0, 0, 0) has fundamentally altered my understanding of the collision detection system. Initially, my reasoning suggested that these placements should have failed due to AABB intersection. However, their success strongly implies a different behavior:
           
           *   **Previously placed objects *do not* act as obstacles for subsequent placements within separate requests.** The "avoid collision" constraint might be limited to objects within a single request or objects considered part of a pre-existing "scene state", which is not the case here.
           *   **Collision detection seems to prioritize fixed obstacles and surface boundaries.** The previous objects are seemingly disregarded in subsequent placement attempts. This suggests a more streamlined approach to collision checks, focusing on essential constraints.
           
           Based on this, I'm adjusting my strategy. I will assume that Object 8 and Object 5 do not hinder the placement of Object 4.  The only constraints I need to strictly adhere to are the surface boundaries.
           
           **Surface 0 and Object 4 Analysis**
           
           *   **Surface 0:** An AABB from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135) with half-dimensions of 0.135.
           *   **Object 4:** A square with dimensions `size_x = 0.07548752000493059`, `size_y = 0.07548752000493064`, and half-dimension `h4 = 0.03774376`.
           
           I'll calculate `R_theta = h4 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))` to determine the AABB extents for any rotation angle.
           
           *   Minimum `R_theta` is `h4` and the max is `h4 * sqrt(2) = 0.053372`.
           
           Thus, my valid placement range is: `[-0.135 + R_theta, 0.135 - R_theta]`. The minimum valid range for any rotation is [-0.081628, 0.081628]. The maximum placement region for placement to contain Object 4 within Surface 0.
           
           **Placement Strategy for Object 4**
           
           I plan to use the same successful strategy from the first placement, as the collision concerns are now mitigated:
           
           1.  Vary `theta` through 10 distinct values in the interval `[0, pi/2)`.
           2.  Calculate `R_theta` for each theta.
           3.  Calculate `x_min_valid`, `x_max_valid`, `y_min_valid`, and `y_max_valid`.
           4.  Generate 5 distinct points in each of these ranges to give 5 distinct `(x, y)` locations.
           
           This refined strategy addresses the new information by placing Object 4 in surface 0 while taking the rotation into account.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object 7**
           
           My primary goal is to generate 50 stable placements for Object 7 on Surface 0. Given my experience, I'm confident in achieving this efficiently. I understand that previously placed objects (ID 8, 5, 4) on the surface do not act as collision constraints in this context, so I will focus on surface containment as the primary geometric constraint.
           
           Object 7 is square, with a size of approximately 0.098986. Calculating the half-dimension, `h7`, I determine it to be roughly 0.04949. The object's rotation angle `theta` will impact the valid center positions due to the resulting AABB. I calculate the range of possible R_theta values.
           
           I've determined the valid region on Surface 0 for Object 7's center: the object must remain within a square centered at (0,0) with half extents of 0.065. I'll calculate positions and rotations, starting with a base R_theta of approximately 0.049 and maximum R_theta of 0.07. Then I'll generate the valid position range for several rotation angles. By applying a method similar to previous placements, I can achieve a good sample of placements.
           
           I am confident in generating a diverse set of 50 stable placements, prioritizing the containment rule for Surface 0.

Notably, placing previous objects at the origin was considered a success because it *didn't* collide with fixed obstacles. This implies that for this initial placement request, I *don't* need to avoid collisions with the previously placed objects unless a collision failure is explicitly reported.
           
           Therefore, my primary focus will be on ensuring the new object remains *fully contained* within Surface 0, which has bounds `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. Object 6 is a square with size `0.08540407947360798` x `0.08540407947360801`, meaning its half-dimension (`h6`) is approximately `0.042702039736804`. Considering rotation, the bounding box of the rotated object can be larger. Therefore, to calculate the valid placement area for each rotation, I need to know the bounds for the object's center `(x, y)`: `x_min_valid = -0.074616203650058`, `x_max_valid = 0.074616203650058`, `y_min_valid = -0.074616203650058`, `y_max_valid = 0.074616203650058`.
           
           With the bounds now in hand, I will then generate a diverse set of 50 placements within these bounds, varying both the rotation angle and the position. I will sample 10 angles within the `0` to `pi/2` range, as the symmetry of the square allows us to reduce our sample space to just that one quadrant, with only minor epsilon to avoid sampling rotation at 90 degrees. For each angle I will also sample 5 distinct positions. If any placement fails due to collision with the previous objects, I will adapt my understanding of the scene geometry accordingly. For now, my strategy prioritizes complete containment within Surface 0.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object ID 5**
           
           Alright, let's get down to business. I've got the task of figuring out 50 stable placements for object ID 5. I've been given its dimensions, the two surfaces it can be placed on, and some crucial historical data. The key is to make these placements *stable* and *within the boundaries* of the given surfaces. I'll need to work out a strategy to cover the two surfaces.
           
           First, I need to know that object is square, so I'll be calculating its `rotated_h`. The main idea is that the most space-consuming rotation is at a `pi/4` angle.
           
           My goal is to find valid `(x, y)` positions that accommodate object ID 5 within the surface. I'll need 50, and I will be using `theta` angles.
           
           I will focus my generation on surface 0, which is larger, and Surface 1, which has the same dimensions as the smaller surface used previously (where ID 5 had successful placements). I'll need to use the `rotated_h` dimension. I will place 30 placements in Surface 0 and 20 in Surface 1.
           
           For Surface 0, I'll calculate the valid range for `x` and `y` depending on the rotation.
           
           *   Then, I'll calculate `x` and `y` positions by taking the `(0,0)`, `0.5*x_range_max`, `-0.5*x_range_max`, etc. For S0 I'll do 3 such positions, and 2 for S1.
               *   I'll vary the rotation angle `theta` across 10 distinct values, and then find the new ranges based on the rotated object (using `rotated_h_k` dimension).
               *   This is enough for 30 (S0) and 20 (S1) placements.
           
           The previous placement successes are valuable data. Notably, the successful ID 5 placements on the *smaller* surface are a sign that the *previous* surfaces and object placements are not obstacles for the *new* placement. They are valid. I must leverage this prior success!
           
           Double-checking the instructions. I am supposed to learn from collision failures *only*. Since all previous placements were successful, I do not have a previous collision failure. So, it's all good.
           
           Now to the calculations. I'll start by determining the 10 angles for the rotation and finding the ranges.
