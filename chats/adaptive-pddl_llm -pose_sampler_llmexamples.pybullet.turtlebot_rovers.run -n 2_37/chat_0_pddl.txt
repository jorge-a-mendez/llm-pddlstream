User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is enclosed by a square region from (-2.5, -2.5) to (2.5, 2.5), defined by obstacles 0-4. There is a vertical wall in the middle, obstacle 5, at x=0. This divides the space into two halves. There are several other smaller rectangular obstacles scattered throughout the scene, some of which are very small and might be difficult to navigate around. I'll need to make sure positions are not within these obstacles and have line-of-sight to the target. I will aim for positions that are roughly within a 2-unit radius around the target point.
