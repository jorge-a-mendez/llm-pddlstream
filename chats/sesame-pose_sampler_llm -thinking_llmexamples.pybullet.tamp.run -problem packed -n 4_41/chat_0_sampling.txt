(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to provide 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 4, dimensions 0.071 x 0.071) on a larger square surface (0.27 x 0.27) centered at (0,0). A placement is defined by (surface_index, rotation_angle (theta), x, y), where x and y are the object's center coordinates. "Stable" means the object won't fall off the surface.
           
           **Understanding the Constraints:**
           
           *   The object *must* be fully contained within the surface.
           *   I need to account for rotation.
           *   I'll vary both rotation and position on the surface.
           
           **Calculations:**
           
           1.  **Effective Bounding Box:** I need to find the effective half-width of the object after rotation. For a square, this is `0.5 * side_length * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. I'll call this `effective_half_side`.
           2.  **Valid Center Range:** To ensure containment, the object's center must be within a specific range: `-S + effective_half_side <= x <= S - effective_half_side` and `-S + effective_half_side <= y <= S - effective_half_side`, where S is the surface's half-width (0.135).
           
           **Generating Placements:**
           
           I'll generate 25 different angles (`theta`) from 0 to 2*pi. For each angle:
           
           1.  I calculate the `effective_half_side` and, thus, the `max_coord`.
           2.  I generate *two* placements:
               *   One centered at (0, 0), which is always stable.
               *   One offset towards a corner, which is calculated as: `(0.7 * max_coord, 0.7 * max_coord)`. This provides variety. This scaling ensures the object is not *too* close to the edge.
           
           This strategy ensures a diverse set of placements, covering different rotations and positions. It also efficiently uses the entire available space.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Avoiding Collisions**
           
           The user has presented a new placement request: position a square object (ID 7) on a square surface (Surface 0) while avoiding a previously placed square object (ID 4) that is fixed in place. I have carefully analyzed the geometry of this scenario, and here's my plan to successfully place the new object:
           
           **Understanding the Constraints:**
           
           *   **Surface:** Surface 0 is a square, so object 7 (and its AABB) needs to remain within the confines of a square.
           *   **Object 4:** Object 4 is a fixed square, which presents a collision obstacle. I need to maintain a separation between object 7 (and its AABB) and object 4 (and its AABB).
           *   **Object 7 Rotation:** Object 7 can rotate. Rotation alters the effective bounding box (AABB) of object 7. I'll need to consider how rotation affects the placement constraints.
           
           **Key Calculations:**
           
           1.  **Object Dimensions:** I know the exact dimensions of both objects 4 and 7. I have determined the half-width of the objects. These are required to ensure there is an appropriate buffer to avoid collisions.
           2.  **Surface Limits:** The coordinates of Surface 0. This is the bounding box for all feasible placements. I'll need to account for object 7's AABB when considering surface limits.
           3.  **Collision Buffer:** To avoid collision, I need to know the minimum distance between the center of object 7 and the center of object 4. I need to add object 4's bounding box to object 7's half-size for each rotation.
           
           **Strategic Considerations for Placement:**
           
           1.  **Rotation:** Due to the shape and size constraints of the squares, the orientation of Object 7 must be limited to multiples of 90 degrees (0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees). This will allow for the largest placement area.
           2.  **No Overlap Check:** To calculate a valid placement, I will calculate the absolute distance from the center of Object 7 to the coordinate origin. I will use the `collision_buffer` as an exclusion zone. If the center of the object 7 falls inside that buffer, a collision occurs.
           
           **Placement Plan:**
           
           1.  **Candidate Positions:** I will find the minimum and maximum coordinates.
           2.  **Angle-Specific Strategy:** I plan to construct 50 unique positions of object 7.
               *   **Angle:** I am placing the object 7 such that there are 4 rotations of 90 degrees.
               *   **Coordinate Generation:** I will create 13 placement coordinates using the calculations. These coordinates will be used at 4 distinct orientations.
           3.  **Coordinate Sets:** 13 values will be selected to ensure object 7 will be placed. I am building a set of coordinates that ensures non-overlap in the regions.
           4.  **Collision Check:** Before considering a position valid, I will use a no-overlap check.
           5.  **Placement List:** By using the method described above, I can generate a placement that avoids Object 4, fits in Surface 0, and is placed at a non-overlapping region for all candidate configurations.
           
           I believe this approach will give me a sufficient distribution of diverse placements that will ensure object placement and avoid collision.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object 5: A Detailed Analytical Approach**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for Object 5 on Surface 0, while avoiding collisions with existing objects, specifically Objects 4 and 7. The surface is a rectangle with dimensions `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`, giving a half-width of `0.135`. Object 5 is a square with a side length of `0.09669`.
           
           First, I need to analyze the geometry. Object 4 is placed at (0, 0), and has a side length of 0.07101. Object 7 is placed at (0.07589, 0.07589) with a side length of 0.08078. Since I’m concerned with rotations of Object 5, I need to understand its effective dimensions for a given angle `theta`. The calculation of this effective size is:  `0.5 * s_obj_5 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.
           
           Given that Object 5 is a square, it's efficient to consider rotations that are multiples of pi/2 (0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2). In these cases, the effective half-size simplifies to 0.04835. This means I need to consider `x_5` and `y_5` which must be in the range of `[-0.08665, 0.08665]` to be within Surface 0.
           
           Now, collision avoidance. To avoid Object 4, I must ensure that the distance from the object center to any point within the AABB of Object 4 is greater than the sum of the respective half-extents, or `abs(x) >= 0.08385` OR `abs(y) >= 0.08385`. For collision avoidance with Object 7, I need a distance separation of `x <= -0.0128` OR `y <= -0.0128`.
           
           Putting it together: I need to sample placement points to ensure the points are collision free. So, I must ensure:
           
           1.  Object 5 placements do not overlap the other objects.
           2.  Object 5 is fully contained by Surface 0.
           
           So for the placement to be valid:
           *   `abs(x) >= 0.08385` OR `abs(y) >= 0.08385` (to avoid Object 4)
           *   `x <= -0.0128` OR `y <= -0.0128` (to avoid Object 7)
           
           My approach to finding the 50 valid placements focuses on sampling points within the possible regions and iterating through them while avoiding collisions. My final algorithm will generate the correct number of placements.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm dealing with. I need to place Object 6, which is essentially a small square, 50 times on Surface 0. The catch? I need to avoid collisions with Objects 4, 7, and 5. This is a packing problem with constraints, and I know I have to get it right. Surface 0 is a 0.27-unit square centered at (0,0). Object 6 is also a square, with side length about 0.097 units, I'm defining a rectangle, the bounding box to check for overlap, and checking for conditions for not having any overlaps. So basically, I'm checking if no part of the AABB is overlapped by another AABB.
           
           **Constraints & Calculations**
           
           I've got the surface size (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  Given that Object 6 also rotates, this means I need to make sure the AABB of Object 6 is contained. Because of the size of Object 6, about 0.097, the max coordinates for x and y are now at 0.0863.
           
           I've determined a bounding box for each existing object and calculated collision distances. Now, avoiding Object 4 means the center of Object 6 must be at least 0.084 units away from the origin.  For Object 7 (centered at approximately (0.075, 0.075)), Object 6 needs to be at least 0.089 units away in the x or y direction, and for Object 5 (centered around (-0.086, -0.086)), it's about 0.097 units away.
           
           **Defining the Feasible Region**
           
           I can simplify things by assuming `theta = 0` (no rotation) initially, as this ensures the most compact bounding box for Object 6. So now I have three exclusion conditions which can be thought of as a set of boundary checks:
           
           1.  Object 4 forces me to stay away from the center of the surface at `0 <= abs(x) <= 0.084` or `0 <= abs(y) <= 0.084`.
           2.  Object 7 dictates that either `x` must be less than -0.0132 or `y` must be less than -0.0132
           3.  Object 5 dictates that either `x` must be larger than 0.0103 or `y` must be larger than 0.0103.
           
           Thus, to place an Object 6, it can not be located in the overlapping bounding box of Object 4, it can not be in the overlapping regions, and it must be bounded by the surface size.
           
           **Analyzing the Exclusion Zones**
           
           I can see I'm left with four potential valid regions. It's essentially two narrow vertical strips at the left and right edges, plus two horizontal strips at the top and bottom.  Each strip has a very limited width:
           
           *   Left vertical: `[-0.086, -0.084]`
           *   Right vertical: `[0.084, 0.086]`
           *   Top horizontal: `[-0.086, -0.013]`
           *   Bottom horizontal: `[0.0104, 0.086]`

           I'm making a point-list of values that fit each of the above conditions. I'm taking the smallest possible number of distinct values and will then run through and output those 50 placement possibilities.

Model:     **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm dealing with. I need to place Object 6, which is essentially a small square, 50 times on Surface 0. The catch? I need to avoid collisions with Objects 4, 7, and 5. This is a packing problem with constraints, and I know I have to get it right. Surface 0 is a 0.27-unit square centered at (0,0). Object 6 is also a square, with side length about 0.097 units, I'm defining a rectangle, the bounding box to check for overlap, and checking for conditions for not having any overlaps. So basically, I'm checking if no part of the AABB is overlapped by another AABB.
           
           **Constraints & Calculations**
           
           I've got the surface size (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  Given that Object 6 also rotates, this means I need to make sure the AABB of Object 6 is contained. Because of the size of Object 6, about 0.097, the max coordinates for x and y are now at 0.0863.
           
           I've determined a bounding box for each existing object and calculated collision distances. Now, avoiding Object 4 means the center of Object 6 must be at least 0.084 units away from the origin.  For Object 7 (centered at approximately (0.075, 0.075)), Object 6 needs to be at least 0.089 units away in the x or y direction, and for Object 5 (centered around (-0.086, -0.086)), it's about 0.097 units away.
           
           **Defining the Feasible Region**
           
           I can simplify things by assuming `theta = 0` (no rotation) initially, as this ensures the most compact bounding box for Object 6. So now I have three exclusion conditions which can be thought of as a set of boundary checks:
           
           1.  Object 4 forces me to stay away from the center of the surface at `0 <= abs(x) <= 0.084` or `0 <= abs(y) <= 0.084`.
           2.  Object 7 dictates that either `x` must be less than -0.0132 or `y` must be less than -0.0132
           3.  Object 5 dictates that either `x` must be larger than 0.0103 or `y` must be larger than 0.0103.
           
           Thus, to place an Object 6, it can not be located in the overlapping bounding box of Object 4, it can not be in the overlapping regions, and it must be bounded by the surface size.
