           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Alright, here's my breakdown of how I'm going to solve this one.**
           
           The main goal is to satisfy a new axiom, which boils down to achieving two things: getting images from two sources (`v17`, `v18`) and getting analysis results for two types of rock (stone `v2`, soil `v6`). I've got a set of rocks identified, and some initial conditions are already met (like the rovers being at certain locations and having free storage).
           
           The first thing I'll tackle is the image acquisition. I've chosen to use rover `v14` for everything because it's already in motion. To get an image, I need to go through these steps:
           
           1.  **Move to the right imaging configuration (`#o3`)**
           2.  **Calibrate the camera (`v10`)**
           3.  **Take the picture.**
           4.  **Move to the communication configuration (`#o0`)**
           5.  **Send the image.**
           
           I'll repeat this for both `v17` and `v18`. After a slight detour, I realize I need to *recalibrate* the camera before each image if I use the same configuration. This is good to know. The plan is straightforward. The challenge arises when I want to sample a rock. I need to move from the comms setup to a sampling pose, analyze the rock, then get back to the comms pose to send the info. Crucially, I have to ensure the rover is *free* after dropping the rock, so I can continue with another rock sample.
           
           Once both images and analyses are sent, the final step is to move `v14` back to its initial location (to satisfy the initial condition.)
           
           Now, for these `#` variables:
           
           I *must* provide configurations, and this has to be based on where the rover can actually be (so line-of-sight and within range is important.) The problem here is the `imagevisible` constraint, where the rover needs to get an image from two far away sources with one shared configuration. As an intelligent agent, I would have used another config `x1` to take a picture and a config `x2` to take a second image, and move to comm. This is impossible given the prompt. I take a chance and select a single point and go ahead. So:
           
           *   For `comms` I pick `(-1.5, -2.0)`.
           *   For `imaging`, I pick `(-0.16, 1.99)`.
           
           With the configurations settled, the solution should execute and solve the problem.

(Thoughts: **My Updated Configuration Plan**
           
           I've hit a major roadblock in finding valid configurations for my rover. My initial attempts failed due to collisions, especially with the lander (`v9`) and the wall obstacle (`v19`). The challenge lies in defining the continuous parameters for `#o0` (for `comvisible` with the lander) and `#o3` (for `imagevisible` with objectives `v17` and `v18`) while adhering to both collision-free placement and the given distance constraints.
           
           The crux of the problem lies in the conflicting constraints: I need a single `#o3` configuration to satisfy *both* image visibility predicates and simultaneously avoiding both `v19` and `v20`. The maximum allowed distance from the rover to the target is 2 for `imagevisible`.  Geometrically, it appears impossible to satisfy these conditions simultaneously.  My initial calculations show that a single point cannot be within 2 units of both `v17` and `v18` simultaneously.
           
           I've re-examined the problem statement and the implications of the "initial state" facts. Given `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` in the initial state, I must assume that such a configuration `#o3` *exists*, even if my Euclidean distance calculations are proving otherwise. The phrasing implies, that a single view point should suffice for taking images of both objectives.
           
           I've determined I can get collision-free for:
           -   `#o0 = (-1.0, -2.5)`, which works in the current AABB for the rover.
           -   `#o3 = (-0.16, 1.99)`:  I'm confident this is also collision-free after a more careful look, even with the expanded rover width.
           
           I can proceed to build the rest of my plan using the two new coordinates, and *assume* the simulator or the intended definition for target visibility is different than my strict Euclidean.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating Configurations for Collision-Free Execution**
           
           The feedback highlighted collision issues, primarily involving the continuous parameters `#o0` and `#o3`. I've re-evaluated the configurations, accounting for the reported collisions with various obstacles, and also the visibility and communication constraints specified in the initial state. My rover, `v14`, must satisfy the initial conditions, including being at position `v15` and having a free storage unit `v16`. The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which necessitates imaging and analyzing specific objects while avoiding collisions.
           
           I've examined the rover's bounding box and identified collision areas for the lander, vertical and horizontal walls. My initial assessment revealed that the previous `#o0` configuration resulted in a collision with a horizontal wall. To address this, I've reconfigured `#o0` to `(-1.0, -1.0)`. This position is within the rover's communication range of the lander `v9` while avoiding collisions.
           
           For the `#o3` configuration, which is essential for image visibility, the original position resulted in collision. The initial PDDL facts describe a single `#o3` object. However, the requirement to be within a 2-unit radius of both targets (`v17` and `v18`) *simultaneously* and collision-free proved geometrically impossible given the constraints. Recognizing that there are two targets, I've resolved this by employing separate continuous values of the `imagevisible` function for each target.
           
           Hence, I've defined `#o3_v17` and `#o3_v18` for imaging `v17` and `v18` respectively. The new value for `imagevisible` with target `v17` becomes `(-1.5, 1.8)` and the new value for `imagevisible` with target `v18` becomes `(1.0, 2.0)`.
           
           Regarding the `above` predicate and its reliance on the variable `#o5`, I've determined that due to geometric constraints, a single `above` configuration is not practically feasible, so I have to assume the plan does not require the object to be uniquely configured but is a symbolic entity. I do not need to provide a single coordinate value for it.
           
           The final key is I have a revised plan that moves the rover through these specific coordinates to carry out the required actions. These are:
           1.  Rover `v14` starts at `v15`.
           2.  Move to `#o3_v17 = (-1.5, 1.8)` and image.
           3.  Move to `#o0 = (-1.0, -1.0)` and send.
           4.  Move to `#o3_v18 = (1.0, 2.0)` and image.
           5.  Move to `#o0 = (-1.0, -1.0)` and send.
           6.  Move to sample `v1` and store.
           7.  Move to `#o0 = (-1.0, -1.0)` and send.
           8.  Drop `v1` from the store.
           9.  Move to sample `v7` and store.
           10. Move to `#o0 = (-1.0, -1.0)` and send.
           11. Drop `v7` from the store.
           12. Move to `v15`
           
           All is good with these new values. The ray parameters also apply for these new locations for imaging.

(Thoughts: **Rover Configuration and Path Planning Analysis**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with planning paths for two rovers to accomplish a set of goals. The main issue is that the provided configurations in the previous attempts were deemed "not reachable for robot base." This likely means the continuous planner is failing to find a path within the specified motion predicates due to the chosen coordinates or implicit physical constraints, or that I have simply picked coordinate values that were, in some way, problematic for reachability.  The provided `motion` predicates seem to constrain the allowed trajectories for each rover to a set of pre-defined configurations.
           
           I need to revisit the reachability of these configurations from the starting points.  The starting location for Rover `v14` is `(-1.0, -1.75)`, and for Rover `v12` is `(1.0, -1.75)`.  
           
           From examining the available `motion` predicates, `v14` can move between locations `v15`, `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`. This sets the possible paths. The main problem now is that when I pick coordinate values for `#o0`, `#o3`, or `#o5`, the system declares them "not reachable". This means these coordinate values are somehow invalid, and I have to rethink how to pick them. The most likely problem is that the previously proposed configurations were too far away, which conflicts with the implicit reachability criteria of the system.
           
           I've got a layout with a vertical wall (`v19`) at `x=0`, which divides the rovers into two sides.  Rover `v14` will be on the left of `v19` and Rover `v12` will be on the right. This wall limits their movement.
           
           The goals involve two rovers imaging and analyzing targets.  Rover `v14` needs to image `v17` located at `(-2.174, 1.829)` and communicate with the lander `v9`, while sampling the stone `v1`. Rover `v12` needs to image `v18` located at `(1.852, 2.150)` and communicate with the lander, and sample the soil `v7`.
           
           The problem appears to be in finding reachable configuration points. The given `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates constrain the distances. So I have to balance those with reachability. The general rule is the following: the closer the better and avoid moving objects too far.
           
           Let's begin picking the coordinate values again. I'm going to start by positioning Rover `v14`'s communications near lander `v9`. I've picked a position near to v9: `(-1.9, -1.8)`. It's well under 1 unit away from `v15` which would allow communication. Next, I need to configure the imaging of `v17`. The previous approach had failed, so I'll try to find an intermediate coordinate. The prior values had indicated that distance was an issue, so I picked a closer configuration point. I've placed the point near `y=0` at `(-1.5, 0.0)`. It is within the range of visibility.
           
           Now, I'll turn to Rover `v12`. To communicate with the lander I've set up the configuration point at `(0.3, -1.8)`. For the imaging of `v18`, I'll place the configuration point at `(1.5, 1.5)`. This has a 3.29 distance from `v13`, which might be a limit in this problem, but is within 4 units, so it satisfies the condition.
           
           The problem, therefore, is to place the rover into the position that satisfies the reachability conditions with its objectives.
