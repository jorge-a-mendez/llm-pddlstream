           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Impossibility of Goal Achievement**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of this. My task is to plan to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunctive goal with various conditions, primarily involving receiving images and analyses of stone and soil. I've broken down the conditions and determined the initial states. I see that my rovers, `v12` and `v14`, are initially at their configurations, and their sensors are free, as expected. I also can see what stones and soils exist.
           
           My main challenge lies in satisfying the predicates related to image and analysis reception: `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           To achieve these, I need the actions `send_image` and `send_analysis`, along with supporting actions like `take_image`, `calibrate`, and `sample_rock`. However, the crucial problem is the restricted set of allowed action instances. The only available actions are `move v12` (v13 to v13 - this means no movement), `move v14` (v15 to v15 - no movement), `drop_rock v12`, and `drop_rock v14`. These actions have no bearing on receiving images or analyses!
           
           The action `take_image` requires the camera to be calibrated, but there is no `calibrate` action instance provided. Therefore, I can't even get to the point of sending the images or analyses.
           
           The problem explicitly states that only the provided actions can be used. Since the required actions to satisfy the goal are not among the allowed action instances, I have to conclude that **the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable with the given constraints and provided action instances.** Therefore, no plan can be devised, and the goal is, in effect, a dead end.
