(Thoughts: **Plan to Achieve new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunction of several conditions. From an expert's perspective, I see we need to satisfy these sub-goals:
           
           *   Receive images of objects `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` on mode `v11`.
           *   Receive the analysis results of any stone and soil.
           
           Here's the approach:
           
           1.  **Imaging:** We'll use rover `v14` (at configuration `v15`) for imaging. Since `atconf(v14, v15)` is true, I interpret this as "the actions must be possible from the current position" considering that the actions like *calibrate*, *take\_image* etc are defined with a *q* parameter for the configuration, and no *move* actions are available.
           
               *   `v14` will *calibrate* its camera `v10` for object `v19` (configuration `#o3`, assumed to be equal to `v15`).
               *   `v14` takes an *image* of `v19` (using the same configurations), then *sends* that image to the lander `v9`.
               *   This calibration-image-send sequence is repeated for `v18` and `v17`.
           
           2.  **Analysis:** Rover `v12` (at configuration `v13`) handles the analysis tasks.
           
               *   `v12` *samples* a rock (let's say `v3` which is a stone) and saves it on its *store* `v16`. Since `free(v12, v16)` is true, the store is currently empty.
               *   `v12` then *sends* the analysis results to `v9` over the lander. The store `v16` will become full.
               *   `v12` *drops* the rock to free its store to analyze a soil sample (`v7`).
               *   `v12` takes the soil sample, *sends* the analysis results to `v9`.
           
           That's the basic strategy. I'm assuming that the parameters in predicates like `imagevisible` and `above` actually refer to the current configuration of the rovers (`v15` for rover `v14` and `v13` for rover `v12`), given there are no *move* actions available. With all images received, and all necessary analyses transmitted, we've successfully achieved `new-axiom@0()`. This interpretation is essential to derive a solution with the available actions in the provided problem.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v19 v10), (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v19 v10 v11), (calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10), (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11), (calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10), (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11), (send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v19 v11), (send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11), (send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11), (sample_rock v12 #o5 v3 v16), (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v3), (sample_rock v12 #o5 v7 v16), (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v7)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Goal Reachability with Given Action Set**
           
           Okay, the user flagged my previous attempt, and rightly so. I need to strictly stick to the permitted action instances. Let's break this down meticulously.
           
           My objective is to achieve the state described by the `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to securing images and analyses, as well as the initial conditions: `atconf` and `free`. Specifically, I need to arrive at a state where I have received images for `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` through `v11`, and analyses for a stone and soil.
           
           My toolset, however, is severely limited. I'm confined to two move actions (which are effectively no-ops) and two `drop_rock` actions. The `drop_rock` actions are conditional on the rover being *full*, which is not true initially. The current state has `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`.
           
           The crucial problem here is the discrepancy between what the *goal* demands and what the *actions* allow. I need to get images and analyses. The valid actions do *not* include any image acquisition, image sending, rock sampling, or analysis sending actions. The `drop_rock` actions are useless here since I am not starting with a rover that is full.
           
           Thus, given this extremely limited action set, I am compelled to conclude that the goal is currently *unreachable*. The necessary predicates for receiving images and analyses are simply beyond my reach within the constraints of the available actions. There's no possible sequence of actions that can transform the initial state into the desired goal state.
