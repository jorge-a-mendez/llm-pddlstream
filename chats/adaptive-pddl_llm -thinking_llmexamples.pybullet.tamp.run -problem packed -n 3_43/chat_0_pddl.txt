User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom atpose(v14, v15)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom stackable(v14, v16)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom supported(v14, v15, v11)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom stackable(v14, v10)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning:**
           
           Okay, I'm tasked with devising a plan to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`. Simple enough. I start by mapping out the initial state: the robot's base configuration (`v3`), the locations of the objects, which arm is where, what objects can be grasped/stacked and where they can be stacked. I see `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are currently supported by `v11` and need to end up on `v16`.
           
           My understanding of the `on` axiom tells me that I need to place the objects such that they are `supported` by `v16` AND that they are at the correct `pose`. The initial state gives me a clue: `#o2` is a target *class* of potential poses on `v16` for all three objects.  It seems the continuous planner can fill in the specific values of `#o2` later, but for now I understand it's a valid place to start.
           
           I then check the actions I have access to. I see I can use `move_base`, which is helpful, but the system also limits me to using the *provided action instances*. Unfortunately, the only valid action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. The task clarifies that I am NOT allowed to use any action instances that are not on the list.
           
           The problem here is I *need* `pick` and `place` actions to move the objects from where they are (on `v11`) to where they need to be (on `v16`). However, neither of these is provided. The `kin` predicate is missing, which is a key requirement for using pick and place actions, but that's a secondary issue; the *primary* problem is the restricted action set.
           
           In fact, the `move_base` instance, `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, does nothing useful. It simply keeps the base at the starting configuration, and even *that* has the side effect of causing `canmove` to be false, meaning it cannot be executed again. Since I can only stay put with the `move_base` and have no access to interact with objects, the goals become unreachable. I am thus forced to conclude that there is NO plan to reach my objective.
