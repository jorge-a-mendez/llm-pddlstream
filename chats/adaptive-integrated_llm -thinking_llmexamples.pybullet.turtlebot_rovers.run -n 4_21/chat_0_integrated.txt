           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachability Analysis**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This goal is defined by a conjunction of several atomic facts, including `receivedimage` predicates (for imaging various objectives) and `receivedanalysis` predicates (for analyzing rock and soil samples).
           
           After carefully examining the problem, I've determined that this goal is currently *unreachable* given the initial state and the permitted action instances.  Here's why:
           
           The primary challenge lies in the *configuration* (`atconf`) predicates. The initial state defines the rovers (`v12` and `v14`) as being at specific configurations (`v13` and `v15`, respectively).  However, the actions required to achieve the goal – specifically `take_image`, `calibrate`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` – all depend on `atconf` preconditions involving *different* configurations (#o0, #o3, and #o5).
           
           While the initial state defines `comvisible`, `imagevisible`, and `above` facts related to these alternate configurations, the only permitted `move` actions simply keep the rovers at their initial positions. There are no actions available to transition the rovers from their current configurations (`v13` and `v15`) to the configurations needed for imaging and analysis (#o0, #o3, and #o5).
           
           In essence, the system is *logically blocked*. The rovers lack the means to reach the locations necessary to perform the required image capture and rock/soil analysis.
           
           Therefore, since the necessary preconditions for core actions cannot be met, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently *unachievable*.  No plan can be devised under these given constraints.
