           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my understanding of the plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`:**
           
           My core objective is to ensure that two rovers, v12 and v14, complete their assigned tasks while fulfilling the initial and final state conditions. `new-axiom@0()` essentially boils down to ensuring two things at the *end*: `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` (meaning they're back at their starting points), and `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` (meaning their stores are empty).
           
           **High-Level Tasks:**
           
           1.  **Imaging (Rover v12):** Rover v12 needs to acquire images of four objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) using mode v11. It will then communicate the images.
           2.  **Analysis (Rover v14):** Rover v14 needs to analyze six rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and send the analyses.
           
           **Key Challenges & Considerations:**
           
           *   **Continuous Parameters:** I have to specify values for "continuous" parameters, which are spatial (like positions and orientations). These values *must* be chosen to satisfy several spatial conditions given in the initial state and are critical to the success of the plan.
           
           *   **Action List Limitations:** The allowed actions limit the ways I can structure the plan. I must use a sequence of actions like `move`, `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `drop_rock`, and `send_analysis`. Any other action, such as any combination or more steps, is invalid.
           
           *   **Store Management:** The store `v16` has a limited capacity.  Rover v14's actions of sampling, analyzing, and dropping are structured. Since v14 samples *only* to send analysis, and `free` is the last predicate to satisfy, I must sample each rock, send the analysis, and *then* drop the sample before v14 can sample another.
           
           **My Plan:**
           
           1.  **Rover v12 (Imaging & Sending):**
               *   **Move:** From its starting configuration (`v13`) to a designated imaging configuration, `#o3`.
               *   **Calibrate:**  Calibrate its camera (v10) for each of the four objectives.
               *   **Take Images:** Acquire images of all four objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20).
               *   **Move:**  Move from imaging config (`#o3`) to a designated comms configuration, `#o0`.
               *   **Send Images:** Send the acquired images of each objective to the lander (`v9`).
               *   **Move:** Return to its starting configuration (`v13`).
           
           2.  **Rover v14 (Sampling & Sending Analysis):**
               *   **Move:** From its starting configuration (`v15`) to a designated sampling configuration, `#o5`.
               *   **Sample:**  Sample one rock at a time.
               *   **Move:**  Move to the comms config (`#o0`).
               *   **Send Analysis:** Send the analysis of the sampled rock.
               *   **Move:**  Return to sampling config (`#o5`).

           *   I will also give distinct coordinates for the comms, `#o0`. This must be a location near the lander (coordinates (-0.5, -1.0)).
           *   I will provide the coordinates for the `#o5` rocks, near the six different rocks. These coordinates will be for (0.0, -0.7).
           *   For the `#o0` for v14 and its lander coms, coordinates are near the lander. (-1.5, -1.5).
           
           **In Summary:** This plan meticulously
)

Model:     **Okay, here's my understanding of the plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`:**
           
           My core objective is to ensure that two rovers, v12 and v14, complete their assigned tasks while fulfilling the initial and final state conditions. `new-axiom@0()` essentially boils down to ensuring two things at the *end*: `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` (meaning they're back at their starting points), and `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` (meaning their stores are empty).
           
           **High-Level Tasks:**
           
           1.  **Imaging (Rover v12):** Rover v12 needs to acquire images of four objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) using mode v11. It will then communicate the images.
           2.  **Analysis (Rover v14):** Rover v14 needs to analyze six rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and send the analyses.
           
           **Key Challenges & Considerations:**
           
           *   **Continuous Parameters:** I have to specify values for "continuous" parameters, which are spatial (like positions and orientations). These values *must* be chosen to satisfy several spatial conditions given in the initial state and are critical to the success of the plan.
           
           *   **Action List Limitations:** The allowed actions limit the ways I can structure the plan. I must use a sequence of actions like `move`, `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `drop_rock`, and `send_analysis`. Any other action, such as any combination or more steps, is invalid.
           
           *   **Store Management:** The store `v16` has a limited capacity.  Rover v14's actions of sampling, analyzing, and dropping are structured. Since v14 samples *only* to send analysis, and `free` is the last predicate to satisfy, I must sample each rock, send the analysis, and *then* drop the sample before v14 can sample another.
           
           **My Plan:**
           
           1.  **Rover v12 (Imaging & Sending):**
               *   **Move:** From its starting configuration (`v13`) to a designated imaging configuration, `#o3`.
               *   **Calibrate:**  Calibrate its camera (v10) for each of the four objectives.
               *   **Take Images:** Acquire images of all four objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20).
               *   **Move:**  Move from imaging config (`#o3`) to a designated comms configuration, `#o0`.
               *   **Send Images:** Send the acquired images of each objective to the lander (`v9`).
               *   **Move:** Return to its starting configuration (`v13`).
           
           2.  **Rover v14 (Sampling & Sending Analysis):**
               *   **Move:** From its starting configuration (`v15`) to a designated sampling configuration, `#o5`.
               *   **Sample:**  Sample one rock at a time.
               *   **Move:**  Move to the comms config (`#o0`).
               *   **Send Analysis:** Send the analysis of the sampled rock.
               *   **Move:**  Return to sampling config (`#o5`).
               *   **Drop Rock:** Drop the sampled rock.
               *   Repeat the sampling-analysis-dropping cycle for each of the remaining five rocks.
               *   Move to the starting position (`v15`).
           
           **Configuration Values:**
           
           To specify these plans, I have the key object "#", and the values needed for each of the instances:
           
           *   The PDDL states "multiple different (rover, target object) pairs" need distinct continuous values. So for `#o3` imaging tasks for *v17, v18, v19 and v20*, I will specify one `#o3` location. These coordinates would be close to the targets (`0.0, 0.5`). 
           *   I will also give distinct coordinates for the comms, `#o0`. This must be a location near the lander (coordinates (-0.5, -1.0)).
           *   I will provide the coordinates for the `#o5` rocks, near the six different rocks. These coordinates will be for (0.0, -0.7).
           *   For the `#o0` for v14 and its lander coms, coordinates are near the lander. (-1.5, -1.5).

(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Rover Configurations**
           
           I've been given some feedback and need to refine the rover configurations in my plan. The main issues are collision avoidance and ensuring all communication and imaging targets are within range and line-of-sight. The initial setup presented a few challenges.
           
           *   **Collision for `#o3` (imaging) with `v21`:** I needed to find a safe spot for rover `v12` to take pictures with `#o3`. The initial attempt `(0.0, 0.5)` collided with a vertical obstacle `v21`. The task is to define the x and y coordinates of the configuration, such that the rover, when placed at the configuration, doesn't collide with any obstacles. I decided to move `v12` to `(0.6, 0.0)` for `#o3`. This keeps it clear of `v21` (which is at `x=0`) and should be a good place for visibility based on the scene setup.  I'm assuming the initial `imagevisible` predicates ensure line of sight and range, as a single vantage point within range for all objectives is otherwise geometrically impossible.
           *   **Reaching the communication point:** The prompt suggested that the communication target is unreachable and specified that the communication range is 4. I re-evaluated the scenario and decided to place the communication point `#o0` for `v12` at `(-1.0, -1.0)`. This spot is well within the communication range and can be reached. I then evaluated the communication range and decided to make `#o0` at `(-1.0, -1.0)` for both rovers.
           *   **Format for `#o5` (sampling):** I had trouble with this, as `#o5` is for sampling rocks, not imaging or communication. The instructions about giving a continuous value for configurations don't seem to apply here. Yet, the system insisted on the specific format. So, even though it feels inconsistent, I'll provide a configuration with a ray and target, although it doesn't seem to matter for the `above` predicate. Since `#o5` *is* a configuration object (it has `conf` associated with it), I decided to use `(-0.5, -0.5)` for `#o5`. This is reachable and avoids collisions.
           *   **Collision at the communication spot (`#o0`):** I had to revise the communication point, since the point I initially had caused a collision with the lander. I moved the communication spot to `(-1.0, -1.0)`.
           
           My revised approach is to maintain the original plan but be precise about the placement of the rovers at the `#o` configurations. I must focus on collision-free positions and that they are in range. Here's a summary of my configurations:
           
           *   **`v12`:**
               *   `#o3` (Imaging): `(0.6, 0.0)` - Reachable, collision-free with `v21`.
               *   `#o0` (Communication): `(-1.0, -1.0)` - Reachable, communication range to lander, collision-free with lander and `v21`.
           *   **`v14`:**
               *   `#o5` (Sampling): `(-0.5, -0.5)` - Reachable, collision-free with `v21`.
               *   `#o0` (Communication): `(-1.0, -1.0)` - Same as `v12`, reachable, collision-free with lander and `v21`.
           
           I'll provide the configurations in the requested format, even if it feels a bit odd for sampling. The key is to find configurations that are feasible and follow the prompt.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Addressing the Rover Planning Challenge**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking, based on the previous failed plan. The core problem is finding valid configurations that satisfy all constraints, especially around a fixed, potentially impassable, obstacle (`v21`). My goal is to achieve the new axiom goal, which hinges on having both rovers, `v12` and `v14`, complete their designated tasks.
           
           The initial error report pointed to reachability and occlusion problems with the configurations used in the last plan. Specifically, the imaging config for `v12` (#o3) and the sampling config for `v14` (#o5) were flagged as unreachable or occluded.  I need a fresh plan to fix those issues, starting with re-evaluating the object positions.
           
           The scene includes two rovers with specific starting positions, `v12` at `(1.0, -1.75)` and `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.  I also have imaging objectives (`v17, v18, v19, v20`) for `v12` and rock samples (`v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8`) for `v14`. There is a wall obstacle along the Y-axis at x=0 (`v21`). The lander `v9` is at a fixed location in the scene.
           
           My approach will be to carefully select the configuration locations, ensuring they are:
           1.  Reachable from the rover's starting positions.
           2.  Collision-free with the environment, especially the obstacle.
           3.  Allow "line-of-sight" communication between the rovers and the lander.
           4.  Allow the rover to take images and sampling actions in the vicinity of the target objects.
           
           The previous failure involved configurations that were *either* unreachable *or* had occlusion. The previous errors pointed to an `occlusion` problem between the sampling config of `v14` (#o5) and rock `v8`. This is very likely due to the wall `v21`. The setup implies the previous `#o3` was not reachable. I'll need to account for all of this.
           
           **Imaging for Rover v12**
           My immediate thought is that a single pose for `v12` to see all imaging objectives efficiently might be hard. But the `imagevisible` constraints seem to state that a single `#o3` configuration is possible to view all `v17, v18, v19, v20` within a given range.
           
           After further consideration, I'm trying a `(1.0, 0.0)` for `#o3`. This location is within range to achieve all images, while allowing it to communicate for reporting. Then, the rover will move to `#o0` which I'll set at `(-0.5, -1.5)`. This is distinct from the lander's location but allows for effective communication.
           
           **Sampling for Rover v14**
           The most complex element is finding a single `#o5` configuration that's 'above' *all* rock samples. Given the spread of rocks and the obstacle, this *seems* impossible. But with the actions available, I suspect the concept is more abstract, and a reachable and collision-free location that *allows* sampling is needed. I'll need to assume that the rover *can* interact with rocks in both regions of the X-axis, meaning it *can* pass through the wall (which geometrically seems impossible), as the provided actions and initial state facts, require me to address the samples that are in X > 0.
           I'll set `#o5` at `(0.1, -1.0)`.
           
           **Communication Setup**
           -   For `v12`, I'll choose `(-0.5, -1.5)` for `#o0`, assuming `v12` passes through to the left.
           -   For `v14`, the `#o0` will be set at `(-1.0, -1.0)` near the lander.
           
           **The Strategy (Assuming Wall Traversability)**
           Assuming these constraints are met, the new plan is:
           
           **For v12:**
           1.  Move from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(1.0, 0.0)` (#o3).
           2.  Take images.
           3.  Move to `(-0.5, -1.5)` (#o0).
           4.  Send images.
           5.  Return to `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           **For v14:**
           1.  Move from

The setup implies the previous `#o3` was not reachable. I'll need to account for all of this.
           
           **Imaging for Rover v12**
           My immediate thought is that a single pose for `v12` to see all imaging objectives efficiently might be hard. But the `imagevisible` constraints seem to state that a single `#o3` configuration is possible to view all `v17, v18, v19, v20` within a given range.
           
           After further consideration, I'm trying a `(1.0, 0.0)` for `#o3`. This location is within range to achieve all images, while allowing it to communicate for reporting. Then, the rover will move to `#o0` which I'll set at `(-0.5, -1.5)`. This is distinct from the lander's location but allows for effective communication.
           
           **Sampling for Rover v14**
           The most complex element is finding a single `#o5` configuration that's 'above' *all* rock samples. Given the spread of rocks and the obstacle, this *seems* impossible. But with the actions available, I suspect the concept is more abstract, and a reachable and collision-free location that *allows* sampling is needed. I'll need to assume that the rover *can* interact with rocks in both regions of the X-axis, meaning it *can* pass through the wall (which geometrically seems impossible), as the provided actions and initial state facts, require me to address the samples that are in X > 0.
           I'll set `#o5` at `(0.1, -1.0)`.
           
           **Communication Setup**
           -   For `v12`, I'll choose `(-0.5, -1.5)` for `#o0`, assuming `v12` passes through to the left.
           -   For `v14`, the `#o0` will be set at `(-1.0, -1.0)` near the lander.
           
           **The Strategy (Assuming Wall Traversability)**
           Assuming these constraints are met, the new plan is:
           
           **For v12:**
           1.  Move from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(1.0, 0.0)` (#o3).
           2.  Take images.
           3.  Move to `(-0.5, -1.5)` (#o0).
           4.  Send images.
           5.  Return to `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           **For v14:**
           1.  Move from

(Thoughts: **Problem Analysis and Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm facing a tough puzzle here. The feedback I'm getting points to a fundamental issue: some proposed configurations just aren't *reachable* or they're colliding with a "wall" named `v21`. The core problem seems to be getting these rovers to the right spots to see and interact with everything, all while avoiding `v21`.
           
           I've been re-evaluating the starting positions, target locations, and potential obstacles. I'm focusing on two rovers: `v12` and `v14`. They both need to get around `v21`, which sits at `x=0`. `v12` starts on one side and needs to image and communicate, and `v14` starts on the other side to sample rocks and communicate. This makes it crucial to understand how `v21` is supposed to work – is it just a collision obstacle or does it also block line-of-sight?
           
           **The Core Contradiction**
           
           Here's the sticking point: the problem explicitly states that I *must* use a single, shared configuration (`#o3`) for *all* imaging actions for `v12`. That means `v12` needs to be in *one* spot where it can "see" objects on both sides of that `x=0` "wall". This is a *major* problem! Given the maximum visibility range, this is impossible.
           
           I have come to the conclusion that if the goal requires imaging multiple objects with one configuration (#o3) in the 2-unit visibility range, then the geometry of the problem is unachievable, because the distances of objectives from `v12` cannot be reached for one position.
           
           In other words: the setup itself is flawed. It's asking the rovers to violate the distance rules to view the targets.
