User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object

           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.012, -0.592), (0.067, -0.512)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.023, -0.297, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.689, 0.725).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.059, -0.334), (0.014, -0.261)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.246, 0.43), (-0.176, 0.501)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.211, 0.465, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.705, 0.709).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.027, -0.552, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.758, 0.652).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Goal Breakdown and Plan**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to achieve the goal: get objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto the surface `v16`. I need to move these objects from their current location, surface `v11`, to `v16`. The basic idea is:
           
           1.  **Move v12:** Pick it up from `v11`, then place it onto `v16`.
           2.  **Move v14:** Pick it up from `v11`, then place it onto `v16`.
           3.  **Move v8:** Pick it up from `v11`, then place it onto `v16`.
           
           The robot has two arms, but I will use the arm `v4`. The robot base remains at `v3` due to the constraint of only `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))` being available, so `move_base` actions will be considered no-ops to move canmove() to true.
           
           **Key Considerations:**
           
           *   **Placement on v16:** I need to make sure the objects `v12`, `v14`, and `v8` are placed fully within the AABB bounds of `v16`. To do this, I will select poses for the objects where the object's extent is within those bounds.
           *   **Continuous Parameters:** The main challenge is providing the correct `(#o2 v12 v16)`, `(#o2 v14 v16)`, and `(#o2 v8 v16)` which represent a pose on surface `v16` for each object. Since the prompt states, I must provide different values for each object, even if on the same surface. I will ensure no collisions occur between these placements.
           *   **Preconditions and Actions:** The planner must find the correct arm configurations and grasps using `pick`, and `place` for `v12`, `v14`, and `v8`. The provided `move_base` instance, `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))` does not move the base, rather it toggles `canmove`. The robot has to be able to use either/both arms. I've chosen to use `v4` sequentially.
           
           **Continuous Parameters and Placement**
           
           I will generate these values and provide my reasoning for positioning on `v16`:
           
           *   `(#o2 v12 v16): (0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)`
           *   `(#o2 v14 v16): (0.0, -0.05, 0.781, 0.0)`
           *   `(#o2 v8 v16): (0.0, 0.05, 0.781, 0.0)`
           
           I am setting the Z coordinate to `0.781` based on the surface height from the starting poses. X and Y coordinates should keep the AABBs for the placed objects completely within the AABB of the destination.
           
           **The Plan (Detailed Actions):**
           
           1.  **(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1_v12 v3 #t_v12_pick)**
               *   Preconditions: `atpose(v12, v13)`, `handempty(v4)`, `atbconf(v3)`
               *   Effects:  `atgrasp(v4, v12, #o1_v12)`, `canmove()`, `NegatedAtom atpose(v12, v13)`, `NegatedAtom handempty(v4)`
           2.  **(place v4 v12 #o2_v12 #o1_v12 v3 #t_v12_place)**
               *   Preconditions: `atgrasp(v4, v12, #o1_v12)`, `atbconf(v3)`
               *   Effects:  `atpose(v12, #o2_v12)`, `handempty(v4)`, `canmove()`, `NegatedAtom atgrasp(v4, v12, #o1_v12)`
           3.  **(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1_v14 v3 #t_v14_pick)**
               *   Preconditions: `atpose(v14, v15)`, `handempty(v4)`, `atbconf(v3)`
               *   Effects:  `atgrasp(v4, v14, #o1_

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #t_v12_pick) , (place v4 v12 #o2 v12 v16 #o1 v3 #t_v12_place) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #t_v14_pick) , (place v4 v14 #o2 v14 v16 #o1 v3 #t_v14_place) , (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #t_v8_pick) , (place v4 v8 #o2 v8 v16 #o1 v3 #t_v8_place)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of the Task**
           
           Okay, so I see the problem. The user is right, I messed up the action selection in the last attempt. The planner was only given *one* valid action instance: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  That's it.  No `pick`, no `place`, no cleaning, no cooking, nothing!  Just the robot moving to and from the *same* location.
           
           The goal, as I understand it, is to get three objects (`v8`, `v12`, and `v14`) all stacked on `v16`.  Right now, those objects are all sitting on `v11`.  The initial state confirms that: `atpose(v12, v13)`, `atpose(v14, v15)`, and `atpose(v8, v9)` – and those poses are all on `v11`.  To get those objects where they need to be, I'd *absolutely* need `pick` and `place` actions, or some equivalent manipulation.
           
           But with only `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, there's literally no way to move or manipulate any of those objects. It's a fundamental mismatch between the achievable actions and the necessary actions. Therefore, I must report that the goal is *not* achievable with the given action set. The problem is simple: the allowed actions do not provide the necessary means to manipulate the objects and achieve the desired state.  It’s as simple as that.
