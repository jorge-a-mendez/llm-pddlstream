User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a vertical obstacle (obstacle 5) at x = 0, spanning the entire y-range. Other smaller obstacles are scattered throughout the environment. The robot's position must be within these bounds.
           
           For the target point (1.78, 1.41), I need to find positions within a radius of 2. This means x should be in ( -0.22, 3.78) and y in (-0.59, 3.41). Considering the overall environment bounds, x is in [-2.5, 2.5] and y is in [-2.5, 2.5].
           
           I'll try to find positions that are not directly in front of the target, considering the possibility of occlusions from other objects. I will also try positions that are not close to the walls or the obstacle at x=0.
           
           Positions:
           (1.0 1.0)
           (1.78 -0.5)
           (0.5 2.0)

           My previous attempts were:
           (1.0 1.0) - This is within the max range of 2 from the target. It's not too close to the x=0 wall.
           (1.78 -0.5) - This is within the max range of 2 from the target.
           (0.5 2.0) - This is within the max range of 2 from the target.
           
           Given that I'm asked for new positions, it's possible that the previous positions collided with some non-fixed obstacles, or were occluded. I will try to find new positions for the target point (1.78, 1.41).
           
           I will try positions further away from the x=0 obstacle, and also vary the y-coordinate more. I'll also try a position on the other side of the target (larger x).
           
           Positions:
           (2.0 0.5)
           (0.8 0.5)
           (1.5 2.5)
