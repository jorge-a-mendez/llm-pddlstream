           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Due to Action Restriction**
           
           My primary goal is to move objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` from their current location on `v11` to the target surface `v20`. To do this, I recognize I need to leverage the axiom `on(?o, ?r)`, which states that for an object `?o` to be `on` a surface `?r`, it must be supported by that surface at a specific pose `?p`.  In the initial state, the `supported` facts for `v20` indicate valid poses for all the target objects. However, their current `atpose` facts place them on `v11`.
           
           The intuitive solution is to use the `pick` and `place` actions. I would need to *pick* each object from its current pose on `v11` and then *place* it onto `v20` at the appropriate pose. My base configuration is `v3` and the robot has hand `v4` that is currently empty. `Kin` facts exist for `pick` and `place` for the robot with arm `v4`. In a usual PDDL planning setting, this would be a straightforward plan.
           
           However, the problem introduces a crucial constraint: only a specific set of action *instances* are allowed.  I'm provided with a list containing only one action: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This action, while valid, effectively does nothing - it moves the base from its current configuration `v3` to the same configuration `v3`. It does *not* include the actions needed to fulfill the required objective.  Critically, `pick` and `place` are *not* permitted according to the strict instruction: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." The continuous parameter `#o0` is part of the move action.
           
           This constraint means that I cannot manipulate the objects in any way. I am explicitly prevented from modifying their `atpose` facts, which are essential for satisfying the goal of getting all the objects `on v20`. I considered how the `kin` facts might change this, but the "list" instruction is too strong.
           
           Given these strict constraints, the goal is demonstrably *unachievable* within the given problem definition. I cannot devise a plan that moves the objects to the desired configuration because the necessary `pick` and `place` actions are explicitly forbidden.
