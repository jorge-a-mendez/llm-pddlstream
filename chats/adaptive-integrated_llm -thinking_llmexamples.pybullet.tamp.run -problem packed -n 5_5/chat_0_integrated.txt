           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v20)
               Atom on(v12, v20)
               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Problem Analysis and Unreachability**
           
           Okay, so the task at hand is to devise a plan to move these five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) from their current positions on v11 to being *on* v20.  The domain provides `pick` and `place` actions, which seem like the obvious choice. However, the crux of the issue lies in the *given constraints* – specifically, the extremely limited set of *valid* action instances.
           
           Initially, I went through the steps to break down the goal `on(object, v20)` into its components: `supported(object, pose, v20)` and `atpose(object, pose)`.  It's clear that I need to pick each object from its initial pose (supported by v11) and place it at a new pose, which, in the problem definition, is called #o2 on v20, a pose parameter that starts with '#', the system has the flexibility to create multiple instances for it.
           
           The problem explicitly states that I must use *only* the action instances provided. The initial state includes some `pose(object, #o2)` facts. However, the instructions say that the instances that are not in the list are not allowed to be used.
           
           Here's the rub: the only *valid* action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This is essentially a "no-op" move, meaning the robot can't actually *do* anything with the objects.  No `pick`, no `place`, nothing.
           
           Since there are no valid `pick` or `place` instances, I can't modify the initial state in a way that leads to the goal's satisfaction. I'm essentially stuck with the objects in their initial positions on v11. Therefore, no plan, no matter how clever I come up with, can move those objects to v20 given these constraints.  This plan is *unachievable*.  I've double and triple-checked the problem statement to ensure I'm not overlooking anything, but the lack of applicable action instances makes the goal impossible. The only available action is moving the base, which is irrelevant to the required task.
