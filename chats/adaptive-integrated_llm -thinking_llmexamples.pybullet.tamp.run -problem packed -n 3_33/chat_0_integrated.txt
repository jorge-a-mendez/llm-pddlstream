           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.23, 0.317, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.097, 0.995).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.189, 0.275), (0.271, 0.358)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.118, 0.367, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.797, 0.604).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.04, -0.438, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.849, 0.528).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.162, 0.324), (-0.075, 0.41)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.086, -0.485), (0.007, -0.391)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom graspable(v14)

           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Unreachability of the Goal**
           
           Okay, I'm facing a classic planning problem. I'm given a goal that requires moving objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`.  The initial state provides some key information, namely that these objects are currently supported on `v11` and have specific poses.  The presence of `#o2` used for all three poses, initially caused a little concern, but the instructions are clear: if the same continuous parameter is used in the initial state, it signifies that these objects can use a *valid* pose on the supporting surface. However, each of these poses will likely require a different value for the continuous parameter, as it's unlikely that the objects occupy the exact same pose on the surface.
           
           My initial thought was to find a sequence of actions to place these objects at distinct poses on `v16`. However, the only available action is `move_base`. There are no `pick` or `place` actions in the provided action instances. This is a dead giveaway to me, an expert in this field.
           
           I've carefully reread the problem description, confirming that I *must* only use the provided action instances.  Since I cannot use pick and place actions, I can't modify the `atpose` predicates for the objects in question. I can't change where these objects are "at pose". They start on `v11` and need to be on `v16`. I can't move them.  Given the goal is `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, `on(v14, v16)`, which is based on the axiom `supported(obj, p, r)` and `atpose(obj, p)`, and I can't alter those predicates, the goal is unreachable.  I need to clearly state that and explain the critical lack of `pick` and `place` actions in the planning context.
