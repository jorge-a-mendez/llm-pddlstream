User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.189, 0.275), (0.271, 0.358)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.04, -0.438, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.849, 0.528).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.162, 0.324), (-0.075, 0.41)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.23, 0.317, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.097, 0.995).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.118, 0.367, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.797, 0.604).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.086, -0.485), (0.007, -0.391)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **A Comprehensive Plan to Achieve the Desired Configuration**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan. The goal is clear: get objects v8, v12, and v14 all stacked nicely on surface v16.  This means precise placement is key, ensuring each object ends up *supported* by v16, and at the right *pose*.  I've thoroughly assessed the initial setup, taking into account object dimensions, their current positions on support v11, the available actions, and the `stackable` predicates, and the initial state.
           
           First things first, I've confirmed that each object can indeed be placed on the target surface, v16. Now, I need a safe and feasible path. I'm thinking a *pick-and-place* strategy, which involves picking each object from its initial location on surface v11 and placing it precisely on v16. The arm to be used is v4, the base to be moved to #o3. So I must check which poses are available.
           
           Now for placement, each must be on their own spot on the surface. To make the move more robust, I'll carefully consider a range of collision-free positions for them. I will use AABB bounds to analyze if they are collision-free. Let's make an accurate plan:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  First, I'll need to relocate the robot base to a suitable position (#o3) for picking and placing. We need to go from v3 to the kin pose #o3.
           2.  **Pick v12:** I will use the `pick` action to grasp v12 from its current location v13 on v11, with the grasp being at #o1
           3.  **Place v12:** Then I will use `place` action to place v12 on the target surface v16 at a specific collision-free, pre-calculated pose. Let's call it #o2_v12.
           4.  **Pick v14:**  Now, the `pick` v4 action to grasp v14 from its current location v15 on v11, with the grasp being at #o1
           5.  **Place v14:** The `place` action for v14 goes on v16 too. I have another new pose for v14, #o2_v14
           6.  **Pick v8:**  Finally, the `pick` v4 action to grasp v8 from its current pose v9 on v11.
           7.  **Place v8:** The `place` action for v8 will set it on v16 too, but at #o2_v8.
           
           In short:  `move_base -> pick -> place -> pick -> place -> pick -> place`
           
           Because of continuous values in poses, I need to find three specific poses for #o2, one for each object.  I've devised a placement configuration that places the objects on a triangle on v16 that is collision-free and stackable. I have ensured that they will be safely placed.
           
           So, I have the plan. Now it is a matter of execution. With this precise and structured plan, I'm confident in achieving the specified goal.
