           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains five graspable objects: v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18. The goal is to place all of these objects onto the surface v20. The robot currently has its base at v3 and both arms (v4 and v6) are empty. The initial state shows all objects on v11, but the goal is to move them to v20. The provided action instances only allow for a base movement from v3 to v3, meaning the robot's base will not change its position. Since no pick or place actions are provided, the only available action is `move_base`. Given the goal requires moving objects, and no pick/place actions are available, the goal is unreachable.
           
           The scene contains five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) that need to be placed on the surface v20. Currently, these objects are on v11 as indicated by `supported` and `atpose` predicates. The robot has two arms (v4 and v6) and its base is at v3.
           The problem requires to move all objects to `v20`. However, the only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action only moves the base from v3 to v3, effectively not moving the robot's base. There are no `pick` or `place` action instances available, which are necessary to move objects. Therefore, the goal of placing objects on v20 is not achievable.
