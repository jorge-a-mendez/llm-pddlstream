           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.07, -0.561), (0.164, -0.468)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.219, -0.506), (-0.141, -0.427)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.204, -0.086), (0.296, 0.005)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.117, -0.514, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.846, 0.533).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.18, -0.467, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.751, 0.661).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.25, -0.04, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.552, 0.834).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Planning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a task: move three objects (v8, v12, and v14) from their current positions on surface v11 to a single surface, v16. The goal is clear: get all three objects "on" v16.  Since I'm dealing with a real-world scenario, I'm assuming the "on" relationship means the objects need to be *supported* by v16.  This translates to having them at specific poses that are supported by the target surface.
           
           My starting point is the facts I'm given: each object has its location (pose) defined, and all three are currently supported by v11.  The `on` predicate, in my understanding, requires both support and a specific at-pose relationship.  Therefore, I'll need to figure out where on v16 each object should go.
           
           The problem requires a plan that's *stable* and collision-free. I interpret "stable" as "fully contained within the bounds of v16".  I know I have to generate unique continuous values for pose "#o2" for each object-surface pair, so I'll create a coordinate system for all the objects and the target surface. The plan requires me to address the bounding boxes and relative positions of each object. I'll need to account for these things.
           
           Now, let's break down the process: It's all about pick-and-place actions. The robot will need to pick up each object from its initial location and place it on v16.  Since I have a single base configuration (#o3) and one robot arm (v4), the process is linear:
           1.  Move the base to a strategic configuration (#o3).
           2.  Pick v8, place it.
           3.  Pick v12, place it.
           4.  Pick v14, place it.
           
           The plan looks like it'll work.  I check for unsafe poses by looking for any collisions between existing poses.
           
           After considering everything, my final plan will be:
           1.  Base Motion: Move the robot base to configuration #o3.
           2.  Pick and Place v8 (object v8) onto #o2 (v16).  I will then calculate a specific coordinate for the target placement. I generate  a collision-free and stable pose.
           3.  Pick and Place v12 (object v12) onto #o2 (v16). I also calculate a specific coordinate for this placement.
           4.  Pick and Place v14 (object v14) onto #o2 (v16). I also generate a collision-free placement.
           
           **Continuous Values for Object Placement:**
           Since the prompt requires a different value for each placement, here's my interpretation.  The actual poses and rotations for placing the objects on v16 are:
           -   v14:  Pose (#o2, v14, v16) = (-0.093, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           -   v12:  Pose (#o2, v12, v16) = (-0.008, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           -   v8:   Pose (#o2, v8, v16) = (0.085, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           
           With these steps, I can confidently say I've devised a clear and efficient plan for this object placement task.
