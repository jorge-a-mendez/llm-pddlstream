           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Assessing the Plan's Feasibility**
           
           Okay, I'm facing a classic planning problem. The goal is clear: I need to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all positioned on `v16`.  Currently, they're sitting on `v11`. I know that for an object to be "on" another, it needs to be "supported" and in the correct "atpose".
           
           Initially, the situation is: `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are all "on" `v11`, based on their "supported" and "atpose" relationships.  To achieve the goal, I need to manipulate these objects to be "supported" by and at a specific "atpose" on `v16`.
           
           My challenge now is to determine if the given actions support moving the objects. There's only one action available: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action doesn't actually *do* anything to change the positions of the objects. It only changes the robot's base.  I need actions that allow me to "pick" and "place" objects.
           
           Thinking about "place" actions, I know I need to satisfy the preconditions: that the target location has a specific 'supported' relationship. I can confirm that `v16` *does* have this requirement.  `v16` is 'supported' for `v8`, `v12` and `v14`. I can see from this that `#o2` is a valid pose to place these objects.
           
           But, back to reality:  my only option is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. Because I have no `pick` or `place` actions available, there's no way to move `v8`, `v12`, or `v14` from their current position on `v11` to the desired target of `v16`.  Therefore, with the given action set, this goal is currently *unachievable*. I would have to revisit the actions or constraints in order to achieve this goal.
