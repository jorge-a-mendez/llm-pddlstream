(Thoughts: **Analysis for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 4, which is a square with side length 0.098556... , on surface 0, a square centered at (0,0) with side length 0.27.  A placement is stable if the object is fully contained within the surface and doesn't collide with any obstacles or other objects (which there aren't yet).
           
           First, I need to figure out the valid range for the object's center (x, y) coordinates on the surface. Since the surface is defined as `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`, its dimensions are known. The object dimensions, `obj_size_x` and `obj_size_y` are both equal to 0.098556...  I know this is a square, so rotating it won't change its bounding box. Therefore the effective size is just `obj_size_x`.  The "half-size" is 0.049278...
           
           To be contained, the object's center must be within a smaller square.  The calculation is straightforward: the minimum x value is `surf_min_x + half_obj_size`, and the maximum is `surf_max_x - half_obj_size`, and the same for y. For this object and surface, that means x and y must be in the range of `[-0.08572192229405944, 0.08572192229405944]`.
           
           To get 50 diverse placements, I can vary the x, y coordinates and include different `theta` values. Since the object is square, theta won't affect the calculations, but I'll generate a grid of x/y values with a set of theta values for each set of coordinates. I'll use `0` and `pi/4` because that's what the requestor specified. I'll create a grid of (x,y) values at `-0.08, -0.04, 0.0, 0.04, 0.08` for both x and y.  That gives me 25 distinct (x, y) coordinates.  Then, I apply `theta=0` for the first 25 and `theta=pi/4` for the next 25. This ensures the placements are diverse, while still fully within the surface boundaries.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Placing Object 5**
           
           Okay, here's the situation: I've got a new object (ID 5) I need to place on a surface.  I've already successfully placed object 4 at a specific location, and I know its size and bounding box. My goal now is to find 50 stable placements for object 5 without any overlap with object 4.  I'm dealing with a square surface and objects, so I need to make sure their AABBs don't intersect.
           
           First, I need to understand the valid region where I can place object 5. The surface itself is a rectangle, and I need to consider the object's dimensions to determine the allowed range for its center coordinates (x and y). I've already calculated the object 5 dimensions: approximately `0.0987` x `0.0987`. This translates to a half-size of `0.0493`. Given my knowledge of the surface and object's size, I can calculate these limits.  
           
           Now, the main challenge is avoiding object 4. I know its AABB, which I can use to filter potential positions for object 5.  Object 4's AABB is roughly `x in [-0.129, -0.031]` and `y in [-0.129, -0.031]`.
           
           My plan is to use a grid-based approach. I will consider a set of x and y coordinates within the valid placement region. I'll test each grid point to see if the resulting placement of object 5 would collide with object 4. I can efficiently do this using the AABBs by checking if their x and y intervals overlap.
           
           So, I'll systematically evaluate possible locations using this:
           
           1.  **Define a Grid:** Generate a grid of x and y coordinates. My initial intuition to include `[-0.08, -0.04, 0, 0.04, 0.08]` seems reasonable as the centers are allowed to be in the range of `[-0.0856, 0.0856]`.
           2.  **Collision Check:** Implement a quick collision test that checks for AABB overlap. This means checking that the x and y ranges of object 5 *intersect* those of object 4.
           
               *   `x_overlap = max(0, min(x4_max, x5_max) - max(x4_min, x5_min))` where `x_overlap > 0` and `y_overlap > 0` means there is an overlap/collision.
           3.  **Filter & Select:** Filter out any grid locations that would cause a collision and retain the non-colliding ones.
           4.  **Count & Expand:** If I do not have enough valid positions (50), I need to expand the grid of x and y coordinates (using a finer grid) to obtain the required number of non-colliding locations.
           5.  **Finalize the 50:** Once I have 50 non-colliding locations for placement of object 5, and I have found the solution.
           
           I've already confirmed that my collision check correctly identifies overlap, so I will now perform this for a finer grid.
           
           **Refinement & Implementation**
           
           I'm now going to refine the grid. After considering the dimensions of object 4 and the desired number of positions, I'll use a finer grid with coordinate values `[-0.08, -0.06, -0.04, -0.02, 0.0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08]` for both x and y. This means I'll have an 81 combinations.
           
           Then, I will run the collision check against the AABB of object 4 for each grid location. By applying this collision check, it is very clear that some x and y will always result in a collision, while others will never result in a collision.
           
           I realize that using a grid helps speed up the collision checks because there is no rotation on either of the objects. Since it's a grid, it's easier to iterate and check. I am therefore confident that the approach is valid for finding 50 stable positions. Since I have 56 possible (x, y) combinations, I can simply pick 50 of them, all with the orientation `0`.

(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I need to figure out 50 stable and collision-free locations for a new square object (ID 6) on surface 0.  First, I've defined the playing field: surface 0 is a rectangle from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). The object's size (`obj6_size`) is 0.0753688, so its center has to stay within the bounds of  [-0.097, 0.097].
           
           Now, the trick is avoiding collisions.  I've got two other objects already on the surface: object 4 (centered at (-0.08, -0.08)) and object 5 (centered at (0.02, -0.08)).  I calculated their AABBs and collision ranges. I determined that object 6 must *not* have its center in the ranges:  (-0.167, 0.007) for object 4 (both x and y) and (-0.067, 0.107) for object 5 (also both x and y).
           
           To generate the placements, I'm using a grid strategy, trying potential center coordinates (x, y) with a step of 0.02, within the range [-0.09, 0.09]. I'm expecting to find 50 positions without collisions. The plan is to create a 10x10 grid and check for intersections.
           
           Using my AABB function, I can directly check if any potential center would intersect with either Object 4 or 5's AABB. I then created a collision grid to quickly determine if there are positions free for placement.
           
           After detailed calculations and considering the object's square shape, the ideal method is to check each position, mark collisions, and grab 50 un-colliding positions.
