           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Path to Placement**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all "on" `v16`. Given my knowledge, that translates to ensuring they're at a specific pose (`#o2`) and supported by `v16`.  Looking at the initial state, I see each object is currently supported by `v11` at distinct poses. The important thing here is recognizing the `atpose` and `supported` predicates, specifically that if an object is supported at a specific pose, and it is at that pose, then it is on that supporting surface.
           
           My plan boils down to this: I need to get each object to `#o2`.
           
           1.  **Base Movement:** First, I'll need to move my base from its initial configuration (`v3`) to a more helpful position (`#o3`). All the pick and place actions work best when the robot is at `#o3`.
           2.  **Object Manipulation:** Then I'll pick each object one at a time from its current location, and place it at pose `#o2` supported by `v16`. Since I can only handle one object at a time, I'll need to work through them in sequence. The provided kinematics information tells me which arm actions are possible.
               *   Pick `v8` from `v9` and place it at `#o2`.
               *   Pick `v12` from `v13` and place it at `#o2`.
               *   Pick `v14` from `v15` and place it at `#o2`.
           
           Crucially, I need to make sure the base is in the right location and the arm is free for each step, which will be ensured by the ordering and the logic of the action preconditions. Assuming everything is safe - which I'm taking as a given based on the absence of negative predicates - this sequence should successfully achieve the goal.
