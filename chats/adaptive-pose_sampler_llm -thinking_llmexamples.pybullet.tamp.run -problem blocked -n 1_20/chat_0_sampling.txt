(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5 (0.07 x 0.07) on surface 0, which is defined by the bounding box `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.  Since the object is effectively square, a rotation of 0 degrees will suffice. I'll focus on finding the (x, y) coordinates for each placement within the surface's valid area, which means ensuring the object doesn't extend beyond the surface boundaries.
           
           First, I'll calculate the valid placement ranges for the object's center.  Given the object's half-size (0.035), the x-range is from `4.235` to `4.765`, and the y-range is from `-0.565` to `-0.035`.
           
           To achieve even spacing for 50 placements, I'll create a grid within these bounds. I've decided on a 7x8 grid, providing a total of 56 potential placements.  I'll generate evenly spaced points along both the x and y axes. The x-step will be `(4.765 - 4.235) / 6 = 0.088333...`. The y-step will be `(0.0 - (-0.565)) / 7 = 0.075714...`. I will start at `x_range_min = 4.235` and calculate x-coordinate for each column. I will start at `-0.565` and calculate y-coordinate for each row. The first 50 values will be returned.
           
           So, for each of the 50 placements, the `surf_idx` will be 0, `theta` will be 0, and the (x, y) values will be taken from the grid generated. The object is small and the surface is relatively large compared to the object, so there's plenty of space. No previous objects to avoid.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 10**
           
           My current task is to generate 50 stable placements for Object ID 10 on Surface ID 0, ensuring that these placements don't collide with a previously placed object, Object ID 5. I'll need to work out the valid placement area on the surface for Object 10, taking into account its dimensions and the obstacle represented by Object 5.
           
           First, I'll identify the boundaries of Surface 0, which is a rectangular area. Next, I’ll determine the valid range for the center of Object 10's placement, given its size (approximately a square with dimensions 0.094575 x 0.094575) and considering that it must stay within the surface bounds.
           
           I’ve got to carefully determine how Object 5 could interact here.  Object 5's position and size (0.07 x 0.07, at (4.235, -0.565)) will be crucial for calculating the collision boundary. I'll define an AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) for Object 5, which will be the basis for my collision checks.
           
           My strategy will involve generating a grid of potential (x, y) coordinates for Object 10’s center, carefully placed within the valid surface area. For each grid point, I'll calculate Object 10's AABB. Then, I’ll perform a precise collision check against Object 5's AABB.  I'll select 50 placements that don’t collide. I've designed a 7x8 grid, slightly over-sampling so I have a buffer if a few placements are invalid.
           
           I've determined a grid distribution strategy for x, with a range of `[4.247287, 4.752712]` to be divided into 7, and y with a range of `[-0.552712, -0.047287]` with a total of 8 points.  I'll start with the first set of `x_coords`, and then iterate across my other coordinates, avoiding the collision box of the obstacle.  Finally, I will generate the non-colliding points.
           
           Let's carefully iterate through these points, calculate the AABBs for each potential placement of Object 10, check for collisions against Object 5's AABB, and store the valid ones. Finally, I will select the initial 50 non-colliding placements to return.
