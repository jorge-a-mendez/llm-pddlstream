User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a vertical wall at x=0. There are also several smaller rectangular obstacles throughout the scene. The target point is (0.0 0.0). I will try to place the robot at a distance of approximately 1.5 to 2 from the target point. I will prioritize positions on the right side of the x=0 wall for the first position to avoid the wall. For the second and third positions I will try to get positions on the left side of the x=0 wall.
           
           Positions:
           (1.5 0.0)
           (-1.5 0.0)
           (0.0 1.5)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point is (0.542 1.824). The previous attempt failed because (1.5 0.0) and (-1.5 0.0) had no line of sight to the target, and (0.0 1.5) collided with the wall at x=0. The wall at x=0 is a major obstacle. The target point is in the upper right quadrant, near the top wall and the x=0 wall. I will prioritize positions that are to the right of the x=0 wall, and away from the top wall and the x=0 wall. A good distance would be approximately 1.5-2 from the target. I will try positions that are further to the right and lower than the target.
           
           Positions:
           (1.5 1.0)
           (2.0 1.5)
           (0.5 0.5)
