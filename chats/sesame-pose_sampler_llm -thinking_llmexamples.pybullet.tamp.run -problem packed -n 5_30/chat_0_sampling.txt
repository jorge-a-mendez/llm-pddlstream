(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           I need to find 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, dimensions ~0.0945 x 0.0945) on a square surface centered at (0,0) and side length 0.27. A stable placement means the object's bounding box is fully contained within the surface's bounding box. Given the object's near-square shape, I realized that I can achieve a good diversity by focusing on rotations of 0 and pi/4, as these represent the axis-aligned and diagonal-aligned orientations, covering the unique orientations of the square.
           
           Since the surface is much larger than the object, the object fits easily at different orientations.  The maximum diagonal dimension of the object is roughly 0.1336, and the half-width of the surface is 0.135, ensuring that the object, even at its diagonal maximum, can always fit within the surface.
           
           Therefore, for `theta = 0`, I will choose 5 evenly spaced `x` and `y` coordinates to make 25 placements. The surface dimensions means a valid range for x and y of +/- 0.08775.
           
           And for `theta = pi/4`, I will choose 5 evenly spaced `x` and `y` coordinates for 25 placements. The valid range for x and y is +/- 0.0682. This gives me a total of 50 placements.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 4**
           
           Alright, I've got a new task: place object 4 on surface 0, avoiding object 5. Surface 0 is a square, and I know object 5's position from a previous placement. I need to generate 50 stable placements for object 4. Here's my plan:
           
           1.  **Understand the Setup:** Surface 0 is a square, and I know the *precise* dimensions and extents. Object 5 is already placed on it and it has been set at `(-0.08, -0.08)` to `(-0.03276, -0.03276)` for x and y bounds, respectively. Object 4 is also a square, with dimensions `0.0834157`.
           
           2.  **Define Collision Avoidance:** The key is to avoid overlap with object 5. So, object 4's bounding box can't intersect with object 5's. Since object 4 is a square, it's easy to calculate its bounding box.
           
           3.  **Rotation Strategy:** I'll consider two rotation angles: 0 degrees and 45 degrees (pi/4 radians).  This will give me different valid placements to avoid object 5.
           
           4.  **Placement Logic:** I'll generate possible center positions for object 4. For each potential center and rotation, I need to check if object 4's bounding box overlaps with object 5's bounding box (using the x and y bounds above).  I derived the non-overlap conditions: essentially, object 4 can't be in object 5's space. This also helps ensure that the placements will be distributed around the surface.
           
           5.  **Generate Placements:** I calculated valid x and y center ranges and created two grids for both 0 and pi/4 rotations. By checking each potential object 4 center placement against the non-overlap conditions and object 5 position, I can calculate a valid set of 25 placements at 0 rotation and another 25 at pi/4 rotation.
           
           In short, I'm using a geometric approach, understanding each square object's bounds, to ensure no collisions. By distributing the object 4 centers and rotation, I plan to find 50 valid placements without any overlap.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Avoiding Collisions on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I need to place 50 instances of Object 8 on Surface 0, making sure they don't bump into Objects 5 and 4, which are already there. Surface 0 is a 0.27m square centered at the origin.
           
           First, I've got to figure out where I *can* place Object 8 without it going off the edge of the surface. Then, I need to carve out the spots that are too close to Objects 5 and 4, creating "no-go zones". The strategy is to find a set of coordinates that satisfy both the surface constraint and the collision avoidance constraints for each of the two primary orientations of Object 8.
           
           Object 8 is a square with side lengths around 0.081m. Because Object 8 can rotate and still fit within the surface, this simplifies to finding safe (x,y) coordinates within the region. I'll test two angles: 0 degrees and 45 degrees.
           
           The key is calculating the "safe" regions based on the dimensions and positions of the existing objects. For 0 degrees, this means ensuring that x > 0.0078 or y > 0.0078, and x > 0.00227 OR y < -0.04227.
           
           So, I'll generate the placement centers, considering:
           
           *   **Rotation 0 Degrees (25 placements):** Generate 15 placements by varying `x` from `0.01` to `0.09` (3 placements) and `y` from `-0.09` to `0.09` (7 placements) to get an array of safe points on the surface, avoid the existing objects, and be within the surface constraints. Then add 10 more placements, where the region `x` from (0.00227, 0.0078] and `y` from (0.0078, 0.0944], to reach 25 placements in total.
           *   **Rotation 45 Degrees (25 placements):** Vary `x` from `0.03` to `0.07` (3 values), and `y` from `-0.07, -0.05, -0.03, -0.01, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07` (8 values) to get `3 * 8 = 24` placements. Then add 1 placement with `x = 0.02` and `y = 0.03`.
           
           These calculated coordinates and angles provide a robust placement algorithm.

           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing 50 stable Object 7s on Surface 0, making sure they don't collide with objects 5, 4, and 8.  Here's my thinking:
           
           1.  **Understand the playing field:** Surface 0 is a square, 0.27 units on a side, centered at (0,0). I have to work within this space.
           
           2.  **Map the obstacles:** I've carefully calculated the bounding boxes (AABBs) for objects 5, 4, and 8.  These AABBs are crucial because they define the "no-go" zones.
           
           3.  **Object 7's Dimensions & Stability:** I've figured out Object 7 is also a square (0.09 units), and I know how far out the furthest points will be if the object is rotated. It's stable, and the object can be rotated on the surface.
           
           4.  **Collision Avoidance (The Heart of the Matter):** This is where it gets tricky. I need to find valid placement locations (x, y coordinates) and rotation angle for Object 7 that avoid collisions. I will evaluate two orientations.
           
               *   **Unrotated (0 degrees):** I need to position the object so it doesn't overlap with any of the obstacle AABBs. My calculations led to a safe region.
               *   **Rotated (45 degrees):** I need to position the object. I will evaluate a placement where the `x` coordinates are between `0.02` and `0.08`, with a step size of `0.015`. Also, I will use `y` coordinates between `0.0` and `0.08`, with a step size of `0.015`. I will use coordinates `x` and `y`, between `0.035` and `0.065`, and `0.02` and `0.06`, with `0.005` steps. This ensures a distribution that fills the required space. I'll make sure to double-check my work!
           
           I'm confident that this approach will yield the 50 stable, collision-free placements I need. I will follow up with my results.

           The new object is **Object ID 6** with extents `(0.09893163259826082, 0.0989316325982608)`. This is a square object.
           
           **1. Stability and Containment on Surface 0:**
           *   Surface half-width/height: `0.135`.
           *   Object 6 unrotated half-extents: `h = 0.09893163259826082 / 2 = 0.049465816`.
           *   Object 6 rotated by `pi/4` (maximum AABB half-extents): `rot_h = h * sqrt(2) = 0.06995646`.
           *   Since both `h` and `rot_h` are less than `0.135`, Object 6 can be placed on Surface 0 at any orientation.
           *   The valid range for the center `(x_c, y_c)` for `theta=0` (smallest AABB) is `[-0.135 + h, 0.135 - h] = [-0.08553418, 0.08553418]`.
           *   The valid range for `(x_c, y_c)` for `theta=pi/4` (largest AABB) is `[-0.135 + rot_h, 0.135 - rot_h] = [-0.06504354, 0.06504354]`.
           
           **2. Collision Avoidance:**
           To avoid collision, Object 6's AABB must not overlap with any of the existing objects' AABBs. My analysis suggests that with the minimal AABB (theta=0 or pi/2) there is extremely limited, if any, space available, as the existing objects occupy most of the central and left regions of the surface. I will attempt to place the object in various locations and orientations that seem geometrically plausible, focusing on corners and edges of the available space, considering all possible (x,y) coordinates within the allowed bounds. Given the problem constraint "never give up", I must provide placements, and the system feedback will be crucial if these are not valid.
           
           I will attempt to generate 25 placements at `theta=0` (axis-aligned) and 25 placements at `theta=pi/2` (also axis-aligned for a square object, for diversity). If those fail to provide enough, I will try `theta=pi/4` (diagonal-aligned).
