(Thoughts: **Placing an Almost-Square Object**
           
           My task is to find 50 stable placements for an object with dimensions roughly 0.1 x 0.1 meters (specifically, `size_x = 0.09887565209694232`, `size_y = 0.09887565209694227`) onto a surface defined as a square of 0.27 meters (from `-0.135` to `0.135` in both the x and y directions).  The surface index is 0.
           
           The key challenge is that the object, though almost square, can be rotated.  When rotated, its effective bounding box changes. My strategy is to take into account these rotated placements.  I've considered the half-extents of the object to be `hx = size_x / 2` and `hy = size_y / 2`, both close to 0.0494.
           
           For rotations, I need the effective half-width and height (`h_eff_x` and `h_eff_y`) which depend on the rotation angle, *theta*.  The general formulas for `h_eff_x` and `h_eff_y` for a given *theta* are:
           -   `h_eff_x(theta) = hx * abs(cos(theta)) + hy * abs(sin(theta))`
           -   `h_eff_y(theta) = hx * abs(sin(theta)) + hy * abs(cos(theta))`
           
           Given that it's nearly a square, the maximum effective bounding box size for any orientation is about 0.07. To keep the object within bounds, I need to keep the object's center `(x, y)` within a specific range dependent on *theta*.
           
           To solve this, I've chosen several rotation angles: `0, pi/16, pi/8, 3pi/8, pi/4, pi/2`. For each angle, I calculate the `h_eff_x` and `h_eff_y`. From these effective half-extents, I determine the valid `x` and `y` ranges for that specific rotation, ensuring the object doesn't go off the surface.  Then, within those valid `x` and `y` ranges, I systematically pick `x` and `y` positions, to ensure that I will cover the surface.  Since I need 50 placements I take 9 points for 5 rotations and 5 additional points for 1 rotation. This approach results in a nice, even spread of positions for each rotation.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Optimization: A Detailed Analysis**
           
           Okay, so we're building on the successful placement of object 5, and now we're tasked with placing object 4 on the same surface without any collisions.  I've got the dimensions and properties of both objects and the surface constraints clearly defined. The key challenge here is avoiding overlap between object 4 and the already positioned object 5, which resides in the bottom-left corner of the surface.
           
           To tackle this, my strategy revolves around the concept of AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes). I've calculated the half-extents for both objects, which allows me to quickly determine the region each object occupies. Because object 5 is already in place, it creates a "forbidden zone" where object 4 can't go.  Knowing object 5 is not rotated, makes the calculation of its AABB simpler.
           
           I'm aiming to generate 50 diverse candidate placements for object 4. I need to ensure they're all within the surface's boundaries and, critically, don't collide with object 5. To do this, I'm defining "clear" regions based on the current configuration and orientation of the object 5. These areas are right of obj5 or above obj5.  I'm exploring several rotations (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2).
           
           To generate points, I'm creating a grid within the valid surface area, taking into account the rotation. Then, I filter out any points that cause a collision with object 5.  This ensures no overlaps occur.
           I'm ensuring the points are properly spread out and that the strategy produces a good variety of different positions.
           
           After all is said and done, my plan should produce up to 50 valid placements for object 4.

(Thoughts: **Okay, let's break down this placement problem step-by-step.** I'm tasked with finding 50 stable positions for a new square object (ID 6) on surface 0, while carefully avoiding collisions with two existing objects: a rectangle (ID 5) and another rectangle (ID 4).
           
           **First, I need to get a clear picture of the surface and the obstacles.** I've calculated the bounding boxes (AABBs) for both object 5 and object 4, defining their occupied regions in the XY-plane. Object 5 sits in a [-0.135, -0.0361] x [-0.135, -0.0361] box, while object 4 occupies [-0.0361, 0.0523] x [-0.135, -0.0466]. The surface 0 itself is bounded by [-0.135, 0.135] in both X and Y.
           
           **The core of the challenge lies in placing the new square object.**  Given its square shape, rotation significantly impacts its "effective" size or footprint. I need to consider various rotations (angles) and figure out how the object's AABB changes with those angles. For example, at a 45-degree angle, the worst-case effective size is a bit bigger than its original size.
           
           **The strategy is now clear:** I'm going to systematically generate candidate placements for the new object. I will generate an appropriate number of angles. For each angle I'll systematically create a grid of potential locations, and for each location, I'll calculate the new object's AABB for that particular rotation and position. Then I will check for collision: if it overlaps with object 5 or 4, it's immediately discarded.  If a placement is collision-free, I add it to the final result.
           
           **Prioritizing the available space:** Looking at the map, there's obviously a "clearer" region above and slightly right of existing objects. The best approach is to start searching for viable positions in that upper-right area. So the logic will give priority to searching in that region first.
           
           **After carefully checking the collision for 50 non-colliding positions, I will have found the optimal solution to the problem.**
