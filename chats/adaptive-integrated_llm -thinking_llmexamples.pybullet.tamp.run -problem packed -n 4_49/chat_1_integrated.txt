User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.155, -0.427), (0.247, -0.335)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.082, 0.493), (0.01, 0.585)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.193, 0.292), (-0.103, 0.382)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.201, -0.381, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.837, 0.548).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.04, 0.345), (0.041, 0.427)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.036, 0.539, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.555, 0.832).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.148, 0.337, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.985, 0.171).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.001, 0.386, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.996, -0.09).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Problem Analysis and Unreachability Conclusion**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a planning problem: I need to get four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) onto surface v18.  The obvious approach is to use `pick` and `place` actions. I look at the initial state: the objects are all on v11. The goal state requires them on v18. I've got two arms, v4 and v6, both empty. My base is at v3.  The *kin* facts seem to indicate that only arm v4 is relevant.
           
           I break down the goal: for each object, I need to find a suitable placement pose on v18. I see that the `supported` fact is pre-defined for all objects, indicating v18 is a valid surface.  So, I assign unique target poses to place each of them on v18. I also see that there are pre-defined base and arm configurations as per the *kin* facts.
           
           However, here's where things get tricky. I have a very limited set of *valid action instances*.  I'm *only* allowed to use `move_base v3 v3 #o0`.  I go through the preconditions and effects of pick and place actions, but they require instantiating pick and place actions, e.g., `(pick v4 v8 v9 g1 v3 t1)`.  The prompt explicitly says any action *not* in the provided list is forbidden.
           
           The facts about the *kin* and *grasp* seem relevant, but they're *facts*, not actions. They're conditions, not operations that I can perform. I try to make sure I'm not overcomplicating things, maybe the valid base configurations are implied.  But it's clear: because `pick` and `place` action instances are *not* provided, I can't use them.
           
           Essentially, I am constrained by only one single action: `move_base` from v3 to v3, which does nothing.
           
           In conclusion, the goal is unreachable.  I can't pick or place the objects because the problem constrains me to only the trivial `move_base` action. There are no other valid actions. The problem's "list of valid action instances" creates this unreachability by the restriction.
