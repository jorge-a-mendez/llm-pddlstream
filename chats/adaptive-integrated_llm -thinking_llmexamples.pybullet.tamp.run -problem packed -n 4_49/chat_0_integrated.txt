User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.155, -0.427), (0.247, -0.335)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.082, 0.493), (0.01, 0.585)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.193, 0.292), (-0.103, 0.382)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.201, -0.381, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.837, 0.548).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.04, 0.345), (0.041, 0.427)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.036, 0.539, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.555, 0.832).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.148, 0.337, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.985, 0.171).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.001, 0.386, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.996, -0.09).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **The Quest to Conquer the Table**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My mission: to move four stubborn objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) from their current perch onto a new surface, v18. I'm provided with the initial scene, the goal state, and a seriously limited toolkit of actions, and here we go. The catch? I can only use the `move_base` function, which has the start and end in the same configuration. This isn't that useful.
           
           The `pick` and `place` actions aren't directly given, I must be able to implicitly create these. I first must understand the initial state. Right now, each object is happily perched on v11, supported, and at a specific pose. The goal? Get them all onto v18. The prompt states that I can create a unique pose name for the destination and I can do this using the information provided. The `supported` predicate means I can place them, if I find appropriate continuous parameters.
           
           I have two arms at my disposal. Both are currently empty. The robot is rooted in place. I have to create all `pick` and `place` action instances to create a plan.
           
           I have my actions and robot initial states. Let's make an actual plan! I need to do the following:
           
           1.  **Pick v8:**  Use one of my arms (let's say v4) to pick up v8 from its current pose, v9. I do this by constructing a `pick` action: pick v8, at its pose, with a grasp, and with a trajectory.
           2.  **Place v8:** With v8 now in my grasp, I'll place it on v18, at a newly defined pose. This involves generating the action parameters: v8, on v18 with a unique target pose, and with a new trajectory and grasp.
           3.  **Repeat:** I'll repeat steps 1 and 2 for v12, v14, and v16, one by one. I can just reuse the arm, v4, as it will be empty after each `place`.
           
           The robot has to work without moving its base at this time, since the given action forces this. I will use one of my poses to perform these actions.
           
           I will need to consider collision avoidance. I need unique placements for the objects on v18 so they don't crash into each other. I'll lay them out in a 2x2 grid to provide collision free poses.
           
           Let's summarize the final plan: I pick an object. I place it. Repeat for the other objects. The trajectory parameters and kinematic solutions will be done behind the scenes. This seems like a reasonable and hopefully achievable plan. I just need to get the poses and trajectories right!

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v8) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #t_place_v8) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v12) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #t_place_v12) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v14) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #t_place_v14) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v16) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #t_place_v16)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Impossibility of Achieving the Goal with Given Constraints**
           
           Okay, so I've looked closely at this problem. The previous attempt used `pick` and `place`, which makes sense because we need to *move* objects to achieve the `on(obj, v18)` goal. But the user rightly pointed out a crucial detail: the *only* available action instance is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. That's a huge problem.
           
           If we're *strictly* limited to just `move_base`, then we're fundamentally stuck. The `move_base` action, by its very definition, only affects the robot's base. It modifies the robot's `canmove` predicate, not the objects' positions or relationships. We need to alter `atpose` to satisfy our `on` goal.
           
           I've re-read the problem statement, specifically "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." That's a *very* restrictive constraint. I get it.
           
           My initial state describes objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` all supported on `v11`. Our goal requires them all to be on `v18`. Changing their locations is the whole point.
           
           The `pick` and `place` actions are specifically designed to change the `atpose` predicate, which is necessary for the `on` predicate to be achieved for each object. We need to update `atpose` so that each object's pose is now on `v18`. Without those actions, we are, without question, completely stuck.
           
           Given the rigid "only allowed to use valid actions from the following list" rule, and the absence of `pick` and `place` actions in that list, I have to conclude that the goal is *unachievable*. We simply don't have the necessary tools to manipulate the objects. I can't construct a plan.
