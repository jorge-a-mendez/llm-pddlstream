User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point is (0.0 0.0).
           The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           The bounding boxes define a central area that is mostly clear, with some obstacles scattered around. The large bounding boxes 0-4 define the outer walls of the environment. Box 5 is a vertical wall at x=0. Boxes 6-10 and 19-21 are in the upper left, upper right, and lower left quadrants. Boxes 11-18 are smaller obstacles scattered. The maximum range from the target is 4.0. Since the target is at (0,0), and the robot x/y limits are [-2.5, 2.5], the robot can be placed anywhere within these limits, as all positions within these limits are within 4.0 units of the origin.
           
           I will try to place the robot in various locations, avoiding the known obstacles, and prioritizing locations further from walls and other large obstacles. I will try positions in all four quadrants, and along the axes.
