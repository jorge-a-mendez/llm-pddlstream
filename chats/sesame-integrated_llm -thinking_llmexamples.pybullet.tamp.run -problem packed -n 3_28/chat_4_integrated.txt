           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q5', '#t19'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g1', '#q5', '#t15'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q5', '#q2', '#t16'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', 'p3', '#g1', '#q2', '#t2'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q2', '#q4', '#t17'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v12', 'v13', '#g2', '#q4', '#t4'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q4', '#q3', '#t20'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v12', 'p4', '#g2', '#q3', '#t3'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q3', '#q1', '#t18'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v14', 'v15', '#g0', '#q1', '#t1'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q1', '#q0', '#t21'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v14', 'p5', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-traj-pose:('#t3', 'v8', 'p3')->()`, which impeded executing the action place('v4', 'v12', 'p4', '#g2', '#q3', '#t3').
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions. If the failure occurs after placing on any pose that does not start with '#', it may be due to using a combination of invalid poses.As the expert, you may decide to choose additional poses, providing their continuous values using any free pose starting with '#'. 

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my plan to tackle this tricky object placement problem.**  I've got a goal: get v8, v12, and v14 all stacked on v16.  They start on v11, supported at different poses.  The problem is, the initial plan failed because putting v12 at its target pose collided with v8, already in place.
           
           So, I need to pick up each object from v11 and put it on v16 at its new pose.  The available actions are `pick` and `place`, and there are some pre-defined `kin` actions describing pick and place motions.
           
           Here's the problem: The original `place` targets (p3, p4, p5) are too close. The previous plan tried to place v12 *after* v8 was in place, and the motion collided. So, the old solution must have had those target poses close together. I figured they needed to be collision free poses.
           
           The solution is to pick *new* poses.  I'm given the freedom to define a continuous pose variable, `#o2`, which will be the *target* on surface `v16`. Since `supported(object, #o2, v16)` is true in the initial state, I know I can define `#o2` somewhere on `v16`.  The problem description states that I need a *separate* `#o2` for each object.
           
           So, I will define a unique pose on v16 for each object. I'll call them `#o2_v8`, `#o2_v12`, and `#o2_v14`. I'll try to find some x-y coordinates on `v16` such that these locations on the surface are:
           1.  Collision-free.
           2.  Within the bounds of `v16`.
           
           Then, I'll place these side-by-side. The initial x,y,z is (0,-0.09,0.782), (0,0,0.782), (0,0.09,0.782). I will put the new target coordinate x values as (-0.09, 0.0, 0.09). Their new target y-coordinate is the same (0.0).  These locations will have adequate separation for collision avoidance.  The z-coordinate will be the same as well.
           
           The plan looks like this:
           
           1.  Move the robot base to `#o3`.
           2.  Pick v8 from its initial location.
           3.  Place v8 at `#o2` (with new pose) on `v16`.
           4.  Pick v12 from its initial location.
           5.  Place v12 at `#o2` on `v16`.
           6.  Pick v14 from its initial location.
           7.  Place v14 at `#o2` on `v16`.
           
           The new target poses will be on v16:
           -   v8: (-0.09, 0.0, 0.782) with no rotation (theta=0)
           -   v12: (0.0, 0.0, 0.782) with no rotation (theta=0)
           -   v14: (0.09, 0.0, 0.782) with no rotation (theta=0)
           
           I'm making a key assumption here: The `new-axiom@0` condition on the `place` action *must* be somehow satisfiable. Since this is a task with several objects, I will assume it means that no collision can exist while placing objects. The underlying representation ensures collisions are detected and prevented.
