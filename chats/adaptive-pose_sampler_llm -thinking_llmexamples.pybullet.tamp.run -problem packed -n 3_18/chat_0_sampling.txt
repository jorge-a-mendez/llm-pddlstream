           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment:** My primary objective is to devise 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 4) with dimensions 0.0854 by 0.0854, on a square surface (surface 0) extending from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135), centered at (0, 0).  The core challenge is ensuring each placement's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) remains entirely within the surface's AABB.
           
           **Geometric Constraints:** Because the object is a square, its bounding box size is consistent, regardless of rotation.  The object's half-side length, crucial for AABB containment calculations, is approximately 0.0427.  This means the object's center must reside within a smaller, inner square region of the surface.  Specifically, the valid range for the object's center coordinates (x, y) is approximately [-0.092, 0.092] for both x and y, derived by subtracting the object's half-side length from the surface's boundaries.
           
           **Placement Strategy:** I'll leverage a grid-based approach to systematically cover the available placement space within the valid x/y region.  Since the object's AABB doesn't change with rotation (due to its square nature), the theta values will be diversified for the visual diversity. I opted for a 7x7 grid (49 placements) with theta = 0, followed by a single placement (center at 0,0) with theta = pi/4 to create additional visual diversity.
           
           **Implementation Details:** The final placements will follow the format (<surf_idx>, <theta>, <x_center>, <y_center>). I've calculated the x and y coordinates by using the values from x_min = -0.09228501182127858, x_max = 0.09228501182127858. The theta values used are 0.0 and pi/4.
           
           **Finalized Placement Generation:** Using the coordinates and rotations described, I can ensure a diverse yet methodical set of 50 stable placements, ready for whatever application is required.

(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements for Object 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've been given a request to find 50 stable positions for a square object (Object 5, side length ~0.093). The goal is to place it on Surface 0, a square surface defined by AABB coordinates.  Crucially, I also have to consider the prior placement of Object 4, another square, which is currently located at a known position. This means I've got to ensure Object 5 doesn't collide with Object 4.
           
           First step: Analyze. I'm going to determine the valid space for Object 5. I calculated the AABB for both objects. Object 5's size results in the valid center x and y coordinate range: from approximately -0.088 to 0.088. Object 4 is located in the bottom-left corner of the surface, its center is at approximately (-0.092, -0.092).
           
           The core challenge is avoiding overlap. Since Object 4 is taking up the bottom left corner, I'll focus my efforts on placing Object 5 primarily in the top, right, or top-right parts of the surface, by enforcing a collision check between each potential candidate placement and Object 4's AABB.
           
           To ensure separation, I've calculated the minimum clearance needed between the objects' edges: `cx >= -0.003049196240385655` OR `cy >= -0.003049196240385655`.
           
           Next up, I'll generate a grid of potential placement positions (64 grid points). I'll need to filter the placements by removing those that would overlap with the established position of Object 4. Any grid placement where `cx < -0.003` AND `cy < -0.003` will be excluded.
           
           With the 64 potential placements generated, I should have a good range to select from. I'll make sure to get 50 valid placements. If I don't, I have two more placements to include: a placement at (0, 0) and the other one with a 45-degree rotation. The object is square, so its AABB is unchanged by rotations, which simplifies the collision check, and so (0,0, pi/4) should also work. I will now generate and filter the final set of 50 stable, non-colliding placements for Object 5.

(Thoughts: **My Current Strategy for Placing Object 6**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable positions for a new object, which I'm calling Object 6, on a specific surface (Surface 0). To ensure a valid placement, I need to account for three key constraints:
           
           1.  **Containment:** Object 6 must stay completely within the boundaries of Surface 0. This involves calculating the valid x and y ranges for the object's center point. Given Object 6 is roughly square, I have determined the allowed ranges for its center's x and y coordinates.
           2.  **Collision Avoidance (with Object 4):** I need to make sure Object 6 does not intersect with Object 4, which has a known position and size. I've defined an AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) for Object 4. To check for collisions, I calculate whether Object 6 would overlap with this bounding box.
           3.  **Collision Avoidance (with Object 5):** Similarly, Object 6 must not collide with Object 5. I've repeated the AABB calculations for Object 5 to determine its bounding box. I then derive the collision conditions like I did for Object 4.
           
           **The Numerical Approach**
           
           To find valid placements, I set up a grid of points within the valid x and y ranges on Surface 0. Then, for each potential placement, I check against the collision conditions for Object 4 and Object 5. In the beginning I will generate more then 50 points and then filter points that collide with each object.
           
           I calculated an 8x8 grid that would generate 64 points.  For the collision, there would be two forbidden regions: one defined by the coordinates of Object 4 that would prevent contact with it and another defined by Object 5 coordinates. This grid wasn't enough, since I only generated 36 points after removing points in the forbidden regions. To resolve this I moved to a 9x9 grid, which will generate 81 points, allowing to get the 50 I require. I then performed a similar check for collisions, and finally got 49 valid coordinates.
           I will add the center point with an `pi/4` rotation for a total of 50.
