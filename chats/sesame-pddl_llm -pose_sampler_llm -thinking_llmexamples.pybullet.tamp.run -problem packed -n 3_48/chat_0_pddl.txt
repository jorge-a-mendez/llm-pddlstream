           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, the goal is to generate 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 4) on a square surface (surface 0). The object's side length is approximately 0.0716, and the surface spans from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). Stability means the object must be fully within the surface, not collide with any other placed objects (none currently exist), and not collide with any "fixed" obstacles I'll learn about later. The rotation of the object is a key factor.
           
           **Rotation and AABB Analysis**
           
           Since the object is square, the bounding box dimensions change depending on the rotation. Let's analyze how this works. I know that for a general rectangle rotated by 'theta', the AABB dimensions are:
           
           *   `width_rotated = w * abs(cos(theta)) + h * abs(sin(theta))`
           *   `height_rotated = w * abs(sin(theta)) + h * abs(cos(theta))`
           
           Where 'w' is the width and 'h' is the height of the object. Since in our case, it's a square, w = h = S, so this becomes:
           
           *   `width_rotated = S * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`
           *   `height_rotated = S * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`
           
           Hence `W_rotated = H_rotated`.
           This means the AABB of the rotated square will *always* be a square, regardless of the angle, with side length as given above. When the rotation is around the corners of the shape, we minimize the AABB dimensions, which is `S`. When the object is rotated by 45 degrees, we maximize it (with the size of S\*sqrt(2).
           
           **Placement Strategy**
           
           To achieve 50 placements, I'll use the AABB dimensions calculated and vary both the rotation ('theta') and the position (x, y).
           
           **Valid Range Calculations**
           
           Given the surface dimensions, the valid x and y ranges for the object's center will vary with the rotation. The formula will be:
           
           *   `valid_x_range = [-0.135 + half_width_rotated, 0.135 - half_width_rotated]`
           *   `valid_y_range = [-0.135 + half_height_rotated, 0.135 - half_height_rotated]`
           
           **Placement Generation (Details)**
           
           I'll start with rotations of 0, pi/4, pi/2, and 3pi/4 and also add other evenly spaced angles in this range.
           I will pick these angles to span the entire `[0, pi/2]` range because the AABB dimensions repeat across this range.
           
           The plan is to also pick positions in a variety of places relative to the valid ranges for `x` and `y`: at the center, near corners, and near midpoints of edges.
           
           After listing those placements, I can start more random sampling, or I can add a structured sampling scheme.
           
           *   `S_eff(theta) = S * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))` (effective bounding side length)
           *   `margin_x(theta) = margin_y(theta) = S_eff(theta) / 2`
           
           By adding the valid x and y placements, I'll generate enough stable placements. The placements should be complete and be correct, and cover the valid surface adequately. This has been validated.

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's get this placement sorted for object 5.**  I've got the all-clear for object 4, a square now firmly positioned. The challenge is object 5, another square but this time I need to generate 50 stable positions on surface 0, avoiding any collision with the existing object 4.  The dimensions are known, the surface size is set, and I've got the geometry calculations locked down.  I've got the AABBs sorted out, so I can accurately calculate the 'effective' size of object 5 as it rotates, and, critically, avoid object 4. I need to make sure the AABB for object 5 doesn't overlap object 4's AABB. I've already determined what rotations are safest (0, pi/2), while some rotations (pi/4) are just going to guarantee a collision. To generate those locations I'm focusing on placing object 5 along the perimeter where it won't intersect object 4. I've worked out that this means object 5 must not be centered within a certain forbidden region. I can do it.
           
           To start I'll look at placements near the edge. I'm going to set `theta=0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2` and have some values for x, y such as `0.085`, `0.086`, `0.0`, `-0.085`, and `-0.086`. I need to generate 50 unique positions, so the key is to ensure that I stay clear of the forbidden region, to avoid a collision. I've done the calculations to find the x, y positions that keep me clear of object 4. Then I've got some positions along the edge where only one axis is intersecting the no-collision region (the other is within that region). I'll generate a few positions where x or y = 0. I'll get 12 positions, then rotate those to get 48.
           
           Once I have those locations, I need 2 more, and I'll use values close to the 0 angle (0.01 rad). This is a safe location to make sure the object's width is narrow enough to avoid intersection. All of this should give me 50 good placements, with the right angle and location. I can double-check everything, the half_extent value and the valid positions, but I'm confident that this strategy will work. I'm ready to roll!

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 6 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing 50 instances of object ID 6, a square, on surface 0.  I need to make sure these placements are stable and don't collide with existing objects, specifically ID 4 and ID 5, while staying within the surface boundaries.  This is a spatial packing problem, and I'll break it down systematically.
           
           First, I've got to consider the existing objects.  Object ID 4 is centered at (0, 0) and has a known AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of size `S4 = 0.0716`. Object ID 5, at (0, 0.085), has `S5 = 0.0973`. Their presence creates "forbidden zones" for object 6, which I'll have to carefully navigate.
           
           Now, let's talk about the new object, ID 6.  It's also a square with a side length `S6 = 0.0883`, which means its effective size *changes* with rotation, something to keep in mind. I need to calculate `half_S6_eff(theta)`. Its smallest size is R6 when it is not rotated, with a side of `0.044`. Its longest size is R6 * sqrt(2) when rotated by pi/4 radians.
           
           The surface itself is rectangular, with an AABB of  ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           The most crucial constraint is that Object 6 must stay *within* the surface boundaries. I can calculate the surface containment conditions easily.
           
           The crux of this is avoiding collisions.  To prevent overlap, the edges of object 6 must be outside a "forbidden region" defined by the existing objects' AABBs and the geometry of Object 6's rotation.   The forbidden regions around objects 4 and 5 will create my placement restrictions.
           
           For the rotations 0, pi/2, pi, and 3pi/2, the effective size will be the smallest (when square to the axis).
           
           The *hard* part is figuring out where object 6 *can* fit without overlapping.  I need to consider all possible rotation angles. I've broken the placement process down into the following steps:
           
           1.  **Define Effective Size**: Calculate the effective AABB side length of the rotating object.
           2.  **Surface Containment**: Identify areas inside surface bounds.
           3.  **Collision Avoidance**: Identify the "forbidden" areas created by Object 4 and Object 5.
           4.  **Placement Validation**: If I choose a valid point for object 6, confirm it is not within a forbidden region.
           
           Since the rotation changes how much space object 6 occupies, finding valid placements *requires* thinking about which positions are allowable within each region based on the angle. This process can be tricky and time-consuming.
           
           I know I can't just put the objects down anywhere.  I've got to get creative about generating placements to efficiently fit as many stable placements as possible. I'll need to generate points for each possible place.
