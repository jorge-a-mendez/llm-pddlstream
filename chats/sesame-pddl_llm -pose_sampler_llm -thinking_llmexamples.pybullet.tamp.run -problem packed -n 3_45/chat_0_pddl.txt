(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement for Object ID 4 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to determine 50 stable placements for an object (ID 4) with given dimensions (`size_x`, `size_y`) on surface 0, defined by the bounds `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  I need to find a set of tuples `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)` representing the placement, where `surf_idx` is fixed at 0.  
           
           The object's near-square shape makes the choice of rotation angle (theta) and center coordinates `(x, y)` critical.  A key challenge is calculating the effective bounding box dimensions for various rotations since the object is an Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) which makes the placement depend on the `theta` value. I must ensure the object, after rotation, fits entirely within the surface boundaries.
           
           To do this, I break down the problem by considering a few key angles. I know that:
           *   `theta = 0` (or multiples of PI) is straightforward: The AABB aligns with the axes. The object's center `(x, y)` must be within a rectangle defined by the half-dimensions of the object.
           *   `theta = PI/2` (or multiples of PI/2) is also straightforward: it’s just the object rotated at 90 degrees.
           *   Other angles will have different effective AABB values, such as PI/4 or 3PI/4, and the effective values of the AABB depend on the `theta` being considered.
           
           The key to stable placement is determining valid regions for `(x, y)` based on these rotated bounding box. Since `size_x` and `size_y` are nearly equal, the rotation effects are less pronounced, but still require precise accounting: `W_eff = w * abs(cos(theta)) + h * abs(sin(theta))` and  `H_eff = h * abs(sin(theta)) + w * abs(cos(theta))`, where w and h are the original sizes of the object (size_x, size_y).
           
           Given the symmetry of rotations and our goal of 50 placements, I'm taking the following approach:
           
           1.  **Angle Distribution:** To distribute placements, I use angles `0, PI/2, PI/4, 3PI/4`.
           2.  **Grid Placement:** I generate a 4x4 grid (16 points) for angles 0 and PI/2 to ensure full coverage of the available space since these angles provide the largest placement ranges. For PI/4 and 3PI/4, to maximize the variety, I use 3x3 grids (9 points each) since these have smaller effective bounding boxes.
           
           By carefully considering each rotation, I have developed a strategy to generate 50 distinct and stable placement configurations. The provided code gives the specific placements, which meets the criteria set out in the problem.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 5**
           
           Okay, so I've got the feedback on the successful placement of object ID 4.  That helps me understand the scene. Now, the task is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5, but here's the kicker: they can't collide with object ID 4.  I've got the sizes and placement of object 4, which I've used to calculate its effective bounding box:  a square roughly centered at (-0.097, -0.097) with sides of 0.075 units. I've also figured out it occupies a region of `[-0.135, -0.0597]` by `[-0.135, -0.0597]`
           
           Object ID 5 is slightly larger than object 4, almost square, and it needs to go on Surface 0. So, I need to compute the valid placement ranges, considering the rotations I'll allow.
           
           My strategy is the same as before, but with extra collision checking:
           
           1.  Calculate the effective width (`W_eff`) and height (`H_eff`) for object 5 under the different rotations: 0, PI/2, PI/4, and 3PI/4.
           2.  Determine the valid (x, y) ranges for the center of object 5 to stay entirely inside Surface 0. This is pretty straightforward.
           3.  For each potential (x, y) placement, check if its bounding box (considering rotation) overlaps with the bounding box of object 4. If it does, discard that placement.
           
           For `theta = 0` (or `PI/2`): `W_eff` = 0.087, and `H_eff` = 0.087.  When the angle is `PI/4` or `3*PI/4`: `W_eff` = `H_eff = 0.123`. I then used some linear algebra calculations to determine those bounding boxes.
           
           I will iterate through the placement candidates now, and for that I'm using an adjusted grid density, with more points near the origin, since the valid area has a smaller space. For the 0 and PI/2 orientations, I'm using 5x5 grid. For PI/4 and 3*PI/4, I'm using 4x4.
           
           The first runs were leading to collisions in the bottom left, so I adjusted the coordinates and recalculated. This allows me to more precisely specify the placement candidates, and discard the collisions, leaving only valid placement values. I then filtered by the condition for collisions.
           
           Using these calculations, I'll generate the valid placements, while keeping a counter to stop once I have 50 unique, stable, and non-colliding locations.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Summary**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable locations for a new object (ID 6) on a surface, avoiding collisions with two existing objects (ID 4 and ID 5).  I've analyzed the existing object's positions and dimensions. Object 4 occupies the space  \[-0.135, -0.0597] x \[-0.135, -0.0597]  and Object 5 is in \[-0.135, -0.0477] x \[-0.0436, 0.0436].  The new object (ID 6) is almost square.  I've defined surface bounds of -0.135 to 0.135 in X and Y directions.
           
           My strategy involves trying a few different rotation angles (0, 90, 45, 135 degrees) for the new object and then generating a grid of possible placement locations within the surface boundaries. For each potential location, I calculate the object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) and check if it overlaps with either of the existing object's AABBs. My collision check function uses the standard approach:  Two AABBs collide if the maximum of their minimum X values is less than the minimum of their maximum X values *and* the maximum of their minimum Y values is less than the minimum of their maximum Y values.
           
           There are edge cases and precision concerns that I had to keep in mind, and that the code I'm running is taking care of, based on the definitions I've set. The initial plan creates placements in a grid, and the filtering of those based on the collisions produces a final set.
           
           The code is now executed, and 50 non-colliding locations are available.
