           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Impasse: A Planning Dilemma**
           
           Okay, here's the situation as I see it. My primary objective is to get these five objects – v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18 – positioned on v20. It's a straightforward "on" relationship: each object needs to be *on* v20.  I've got the initial state, the current configuration of the world: these objects are all currently supported by v11.  They're stacked.
           
           My first thought process is to break down the goal for each object. For each one, I need to find the correct `atpose` where they are supported by `v20`. I am given that such poses (`#o2` poses) and support relationships (e.g. `supported(v8, #o2, v20)`) exist in the problem.  
           
           I need to move each object to its new pose at v20. My usual approach would be a classic pick-and-place operation, using the `pick` and `place` actions.  I'd pick up an object from its current location, which is supported by `v11`, and place it on v20.
           
           However, here's the rub.  The only action I am *allowed* to use is `move_base`. This basically just moves the robot from where it is to where it is. It does nothing to change object locations.  More importantly, the `pick` and `place` actions, which are crucial for this type of task, are *not* on the list of allowed actions. The problem statement explicitly says I can't use actions that aren't on this list.
           
           I've checked the preconditions and effects of my available actions, and no combination of actions seems to achieve the goal given that I have only `move_base` available.  Without the ability to manipulate the `atpose` facts, I simply cannot change the objects' positions.
           
           I'm now certain.  The problem is *unsolvable* given the constraints.  I can't pick up, I can't place. I can't possibly meet the "on" condition for all those objects. The move_base is useless.
