           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning Through the Planning Problem**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The core of this problem is achieving a specific configuration: getting `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` all *on* `v20`.  Since I know that `on` is defined by `supported` and `atpose`, I need to figure out how to arrange the objects such that each of them is both supported by `v20` and in the right pose.
           
           From the problem, it seems that there are already facts about their support by v20.  So, I need to ensure that they are also at a pose that makes the predicate true, `atpose` with the same pose, likely `#o2`. The initial state, and the implied support of the other fact with objects on v11, indicates that all the relevant objects have this state: they are supported by `v11`, and are at their respective `v9`, `v13`, `v15`, `v17`, `v19` poses.  This seems straightforward: I have to move the objects to `#o2`.
           
           The available actions are `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`, however, I can immediately ignore cleaning and cooking. I'll need `pick` and `place` to manipulate the objects' poses.  I know that these actions will be contingent on the available robot arms (`v4`, `v6` both `handempty`), the base configuration (`v3` `atbconf`), and the object's graspability (all objects seem to be `graspable` with a grasp parameter `#o1`).
           
           However, there's a serious caveat. The problem statement explicitly limits me to *one* action instance: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This is a no-op! It means the robot can't actually move. Crucially, *I have no allowed instances of pick or place*.  Without these, I can't modify the `atpose` of any object. I *can't* change the facts from `atpose(v8, v9)` to `atpose(v8, #o2)`, or similar for the other objects.
           
           Therefore, since the goal requires placing the objects on `v20`, and I lack the tools (pick and place) to do so, and am *explicitly disallowed* from using them, the goal is unachievable given the constraints of the allowed actions. I need to clearly communicate that the limited action space makes achieving the desired final configuration impossible. I cannot change the world state in a way that aligns with the goal, because the only action instance I'm allowed to use is ineffectual.
