           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal: Achieve `new-axiom@0()` in the `pr2-tamp` domain**
           
           My analysis begins by deconstructing the goal: it's about making an object of a certain type be "on" another object. In this instance, the specific goal is to place object `v12` (which is of the correct type) "on" object `v18`. Since `v12` can be supported on `v18`, I focused on satisfying the `on` axiom, which essentially means ensuring `v12` is supported at a specific pose.
           
           From the initial state, I can see that `v12` is currently at pose `v13`. To move it to the required pose `#o2` supported on `v18`, I need to leverage the available `pick` and `place` actions of the robot arm (`v4`).
           
           My proposed plan is as follows:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  First, I will move the robot's base to the configuration `#o3` (if it's not already in that configuration), using the `move_base` action. This seems necessary because the `pick` action requires the base to be at a specific configuration. It's safe to assume `#o3` is different from the initial configuration `v3` for now.
           
           2.  **Pick:** Then, I will use the `pick` action to grasp `v12` from its current pose `v13` using arm `v4`.  
           
           3.  **Place:** Finally, I will use the `place` action to place `v12` at the desired pose `#o2` supported by object `v18`.
           
           I've carefully verified the preconditions and effects of each action against the initial state and the expected state changes. The plan seems logically sound, addressing each goal step.
           
           The use of continuous parameters like `#o0`, `#o1`, etc. appears to be consistent with the initial conditions and action definitions. I've considered that the base can be at its original state and the `move_base` might not need to be executed.
           
           All preconditions seem to be satisfied, and the plan, if executed, would successfully result in the achievement of my goal, `new-axiom@0()`, placing `v12` on `v18`.
