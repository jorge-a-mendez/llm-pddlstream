           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem requires satisfying the `new-axiom@0` axiom, which is a conjunction of several conditions. Let's break down these conditions and how to achieve them:
           
           1.  `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           2.  `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           3.  `free(v12, v16)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           4.  `free(v14, v16)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           5.  `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This means rover v12 or v14 needs to take an image of objective v17 with mode v11 and send it to lander v9.
           6.  `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Similar to above, for objective v18.
           7.  `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: Similar to above, for objective v19.
           8.  `type(?stone, v2)`: This refers to rocks of type v2. We have v1, v3, and v4 of type v2.
           9.  `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means at least one rock of type v2 (v1, v3, or v4) needs to be sampled by a rover and its analysis sent to the lander.
           10. `type(?soil, v6)`: This refers to rocks of type v6. We have v5, v7, and v8 of type v6.
           11. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means at least one rock of type v6 (v5, v7, or v8) needs to be sampled by a rover and its analysis sent to the lander.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage` for v17, v18, and v19:
           Both rovers v12 and v14 have `imagevisible` predicates for v17, v18, v19 at configuration #o3 using ray #o4. They also have `comvisible` predicates to lander v9 at configuration #o0 using ray #o1.
           The camera v10 is onboard both rovers and supports mode v11.
           The process would be: `calibrate` -> `take_image` -> `move` to #o0 if not there -> `send_image`.
           Since rover v12 starts at v13, and v14 starts at v15, and they both have `motion` to #o3 and #o0, we can use either rover. We should calibrate and take all images with one rover at configuration #o3 and then move to configuration #o0 to send all images.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis` for `?stone` (type v2) and `?soil` (type v6):
           We need to sample one rock of type v2 and one of type v6.
           For type v2, we have v1, v3, v4. For type v6, we have v5, v7, v8.
           Both rovers v12 and v14 have `above` predicates for all these rocks at configuration #o5.
           The process would be: `move` to #o5 if not there -> `sample_rock` -> `move` to #o0 if not there -> `send_analysis`.
           Since `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true, both rovers have a free store.
           
           Let's pick rover v14 for imaging and rover v12 for sampling and analysis. This allows parallel execution conceptually and reduces movement for each rover.
           
           **Rover v14 (Imaging):**
           1.  Move v14 from v15 to #o3 (for imaging).
           2.  Calibrate camera v10 on v14 for v17.
           3.  Take image of v17.
           4.  Calibrate camera v10 on v14 for v18. (Need to recalibrate after each image as per PDDL effects)
           5.  Take image of v18.
           6.  Calibrate camera v10 on v14 for v19.
           7.  Take image of v19.
           8.  Move v14 from #o3 to #o0 (for communication).
           9.  Send image of v17.
           10. Send image of v18.
           11. Send image of v19.
           
           **Rover v12 (Sampling & Analysis):**
           1.  Move v12 from v13 to #o5 (for sampling).
           2.  Sample rock v1 (type v2, stone).
           3.  Sample rock v5 (type v6, soil).
           4.  Move v12 from #o5 to #o0 (for communication).

           Let's check for collisions with AABBs.
           Rover v14 starts at (-1.0, -1.75). Rover v12 starts at (1.0, -1.75).
           Objects: v3 ((1.353, 1.867), (1.441, 1.954)), v18 ((2.121, 1.982), (2.22, 2.08)), v19 ((-0.508, 1.955), (-0.409, 2.054)), v7 ((-0.518, 0.238), (-0.38, 0.377)), v4 ((-0.987, 0.047), (-0.895, 0.139)), v1 ((0.844, -0.628), (0.946, -0.526)), v8 ((1.083, -1.264), (1.188, -1.159)), v17 ((-2.201, 1.939), (-2.117, 2.023)), v9 ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)), v5 ((0.643, 1.21), (0.762, 1.328)).
           
           The configurations #o0, #o3, #o5 are continuous parameters, so their values will be provided later. We assume they are collision-free and reachable.
           
           Order of actions:
           It seems more efficient to use the same rover for all imaging tasks and the other rover for all sampling tasks.
           
           Rover v14 actions for imaging:
           1. (move v14 v15 #o2 #o3)
           2. (calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)
           3. (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)

           10. (send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11)
           11. (send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v19 v11)
           
           Rover v12 actions for sampling:
           1. (move v12 v13 #o2 #o5)
           2. (sample_rock v12 #o5 v1 v16) (v1 is type v2 - stone)
           3. (sample_rock v12 #o5 v5 v16) (v5 is type v6 - soil)
           4. (move v12 #o5 #o2 #o0)
           5. (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v1)
           6. (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v5)
           
           All the necessary `motion` and `imagevisible`/`comvisible` predicates are present in the initial state with the continuous parameters. The plan seems sound.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The problem requires satisfying the `new-axiom@0` axiom, which is a conjunction of several conditions. Let's break down these conditions and how to achieve them:
           
           1.  `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           2.  `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           3.  `free(v12, v16)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           4.  `free(v14, v16)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           5.  `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This means rover v12 or v14 needs to take an image of objective v17 with mode v11 and send it to lander v9.
           6.  `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Similar to above, for objective v18.
           7.  `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: Similar to above, for objective v19.
           8.  `type(?stone, v2)`: This refers to rocks of type v2. We have v1, v3, and v4 of type v2.
           9.  `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means at least one rock of type v2 (v1, v3, or v4) needs to be sampled by a rover and its analysis sent to the lander.
           10. `type(?soil, v6)`: This refers to rocks of type v6. We have v5, v7, and v8 of type v6.
           11. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means at least one rock of type v6 (v5, v7, or v8) needs to be sampled by a rover and its analysis sent to the lander.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage` for v17, v18, and v19:
           Both rovers v12 and v14 have `imagevisible` predicates for v17, v18, v19 at configuration #o3 using ray #o4. They also have `comvisible` predicates to lander v9 at configuration #o0 using ray #o1.
           The camera v10 is onboard both rovers and supports mode v11.
           The process would be: `calibrate` -> `take_image` -> `move` to #o0 if not there -> `send_image`.
           Since rover v12 starts at v13, and v14 starts at v15, and they both have `motion` to #o3 and #o0, we can use either rover. We should calibrate and take all images with one rover at configuration #o3 and then move to configuration #o0 to send all images.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis` for `?stone` (type v2) and `?soil` (type v6):
           We need to sample one rock of type v2 and one of type v6.
           For type v2, we have v1, v3, v4. For type v6, we have v5, v7, v8.
           Both rovers v12 and v14 have `above` predicates for all these rocks at configuration #o5.
           The process would be: `move` to #o5 if not there -> `sample_rock` -> `move` to #o0 if not there -> `send_analysis`.
           Since `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true, both rovers have a free store.
           
           Let's pick rover v14 for imaging and rover v12 for sampling and analysis. This allows parallel execution conceptually and reduces movement for each rover.
           
           **Rover v14 (Imaging):**
           1.  Move v14 from v15 to #o3 (for imaging).
           2.  Calibrate camera v10 on v14 for v17.
           3.  Take image of v17.
           4.  Calibrate camera v10 on v14 for v18. (Need to recalibrate after each image as per PDDL effects)
           5.  Take image of v18.
           6.  Calibrate camera v10 on v14 for v19.
           7.  Take image of v19.
           8.  Move v14 from #o3 to #o0 (for communication).
           9.  Send image of v17.
           10. Send image of v18.
           11. Send image of v19.
           
           **Rover v12 (Sampling & Analysis):**
           1.  Move v12 from v13 to #o5 (for sampling).
           2.  Sample rock v1 (type v2, stone).
           3.  Sample rock v5 (type v6, soil).
           4.  Move v12 from #o5 to #o0 (for communication).
           5.  Send analysis of v1.
           6.  Send analysis of v5.
           
           All the necessary `motion` and `imagevisible`/`comvisible` predicates are present in the initial state with the continuous parameters. The plan seems sound.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The previous attempt failed due to unreachable or colliding configurations. Let's re-evaluate the continuous parameters for the configurations, ensuring they are valid given the existing objects and the rover's initial positions.
           
           **Rover V14:**
           *   Initial position: `v15` which is `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           *   Needs to reach `#o3` for imaging objectives `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
               *   `v17` is at `(-2.201, 1.939)` to `(-2.117, 2.023)`.
               *   `v18` is at `(2.121, 1.982)` to `(2.22, 2.08)`.
               *   `v19` is at `(-0.508, 1.955)` to `(-0.409, 2.054)`.
               *   Rover v14 starts at x = -1.0. To image v17 (x around -2.2), it might need to move further left. To image v18 (x around 2.1), it would need to move far right. To image v19 (x around -0.5), it needs to move slightly right. It's unlikely that a single `#o3` configuration can achieve line-of-sight to all three of these widely separated objectives. The problem statement says "If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair". This indicates we should use *different* configurations for each objective if one `#o3` doesn't work. Let's name them `#o3_v17`, `#o3_v18`, `#o3_v19`.
           *   Needs to reach `#o0` for communicating with lander `v9`.
               *   `v9` is at `(-2.405, -2.346)` to `(-1.395, -1.654)`.
               *   Rover v14 is near x=-1.0. A communication configuration like `(-1.5, -2.0)` was in collision with `v9` itself. We need to be close to `v9` for `comvisible` (max dist 4), but not colliding. A position like `(-1.0, -2.0)` might be better, it is within the bounding box of the lander in X but outside its Y, this may be considered valid by the geometry module. Let's try `(-1.5, -1.0)` or `(-1.0, -1.0)` to be clear of v9. The lander's Y range is `(-2.346, -1.654)`. So a Y of -1.0 is far above it. Maybe `(-1.8, -1.5)` to be near the lander without being in it. Let's try `(-1.8, -1.5)` for `#o0_v14_v9`.
           
           **Rover V12:**
           *   Initial position: `v13` which is `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           *   Needs to reach `#o5` for sampling rocks `v1` (type v2) and `v5` (type v6).
               *   `v1` is at `(0.844, -0.628)` to `(0.946, -0.526)`.
               *   `v5` is at `(0.643, 1.21)` to `(0.762, 1.328)`.
               *   These are also quite separated in Y. A single `#o5` might not work. Let's use `#o5_v1` and `#o5_v5`.
           *   Needs to reach `#o0` for communicating with lander `v9`.
               *   `v9` is at `(-2.405, -2.346)` to `(-1.395, -1.654)`.
               *   Rover v12 is at x=1.0. This is quite far from `v9`. `(0.0, -2.0)` was in collision with `v20`. Let's try `(-1.0, -2.0)` for `#o0_v12_v9`. This is within range of `v9` and does not collide with `v20`.
           
           Let's refine the plan with specific configurations for each (rover, target) pair. We will still use rover v14 for imaging and v12 for sampling. This means we'll need to define 3 image configurations for v14, one comm configuration for v14, 2 sample configurations for v12, and one comm configuration for v12.
           
           Let's rename the continuous parameters:
           *   `#o3_v17`: config for v14 to image v17
           *   `#o3_v18`: config for v14 to image v18
           *   `#o3_v19`: config for v14 to image v19
           *   `#o0_v14_v9`: config for v14 to communicate with v9
           *   `#o5_v1`: config for v12 to sample v1
           *   `#o5_v5`: config for v12 to sample v5
           *   `#o0_v12_v9`: config for v12 to communicate with v9
           
           And update `imagevisible`/`comvisible`/`above` predicates accordingly in the initial state. Since only `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are listed in the initial state with `conf` predicates, we cannot introduce new #objects. This implies that the problem expects these single #o0, #o3, #o5 objects to work for multiple (rover, target) pairs, or that the system will find values for the specific (rover, target, ray) tuple with one value of #oN that makes sense. The problem statement says "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration such that...". This means we should stick to using #o0, #o3, #o5. It implies a single #o3 configuration must work for all imaging, and a single #o0 for all communications, and a single #o5 for all sampling. This is quite challenging if targets are spread out.
           
           Given the constraints, let's try to find a single #o3 configuration for v14 to see all three objectives `v17`, `v18`, `v19`. This is highly unlikely given their spread.
           `v17`: (-2.2, 1.9)
           `v18`: (2.1, 2.0)
           `v19`: (-0.5, 2.0)
           A single configuration cannot see all three. This means the problem structure or the initial `imagevisible` predicates are misleading if we can only use one `#o3`. However, the prompt says "If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair". This suggests that for each (rover, target) pair in `imagevisible(rover, #o3, ray, target)` we *can* specify a different `(x,y)` for #o3. So, we'll interpret `#o3` as a placeholder for a specific configuration *value* for that particular (rover, target) pair. Same for #o0 and #o5.
           
           Let's restart with the assumption that #o3, #o0, #o5 will take on different values for different (rover, target) pairs, and we must define them.
           
           **Rover V14 (Imaging and Communicating Images):**
           Initial: `v15` = `(-1.0, -1.75)`
           1.  Image `v17` (objective, `(-2.2, 1.9)`). A good position for v14 to image v17 would be near v17, but keeping a distance of 2. For example, `(-1.8, 1.0)`.
           2.  Image `v18` (objective, `(2.1, 2.0)`). A good position for v14 to image v18 would be near v18. For example, `(1.5, 1.0)`.
           3.  Image `v19` (objective, `(-0.5, 2.0)`). A good position for v14 to image v19 would be near v19. For example, `(-0.5, 1.0)`.
           4.  Communicate with `v9` (lander, `(-2.4, -2.3)` to `(-1.3, -1.6)`). A good communication position for v14 would be close to v9, but outside its AABB. `(-1.8, -1.5)` from last attempt was a collision. The lander's Y range is `(-2.346, -1.654)`. So a position with Y slightly above -1.654, or slightly below -2.346 is good. Let's try `(-1.8, -1.5)` again. It might be that the ray was blocked. Let's try `(-1.8, -1.0)` for better line of sight.
           
           **Rover V12 (Sampling and Communicating Analysis):**
           Initial: `v13` = `(1.0, -1.75)`
           1.  Sample `v1` (rock, `(0.8, -0.6)`). A good position for v12 to sample v1 would be directly above it. For example, `(0.9, -0.5)`.
           2.  Sample `v5` (rock, `(0.6, 1.2)`). A good position for v12 to sample v5 would be directly above it. For example, `(0.7, 1.3)`.
           3.  Communicate with `v9` (lander, `(-2.4, -2.3)` to `(-1.3, -1.6)`). A good communication position for v12, given it's starting at x=1.0. To reach v9, it needs to move far left. Let's try `(-1.0, -2.0)`. This was blocked by `v20`. Let's assume v20 is a thin wall at `x=0`. Rover v12 needs to move to the left of x=0. To avoid collision with v20 and be within comrange of v9. A position like `(-1.5, -2.0)` for v12 could work.
           
           Let's refine the plan.
           
           **Rover v14 Plan:**
           1.  Move to `(-1.8, 1.0)` to image `v17`. (`#o3_v17`)
           2.  Calibrate and `take_image` of `v17`.
           3.  Move to `(1.5, 1.0)` to image `v18`. (`#o3_v18`)
           4.  Calibrate and `take_image` of `v18`.
           5.  Move to `(-0.5, 1.0)` to image `v19`. (`#o3_v19`)
           6.  Calibrate and `take_image` of `v19`.
           7.  Move to `(-1.8, -1.0)` to send images. (`#o0_v14_v9`)
           8.  `send_image` for `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           
           **Rover v12 Plan:**
           1.  Move to `(0.9, -0.5)` to sample `v1`. (`#o5_v1`)
           2.  `sample_rock` `v1`.
           3.  Move to `(0.7, 1.3)` to sample `v5`. (`#o5_v5`)
           4.  `sample_rock` `v5`.
           5.  Move to `(-1.5, -2.0)` to send analysis. (`#o0_v12_v9`)
           6.  `send_analysis` for `v1`, `v5`.
           
           This re-interpretation of the continuous parameters seems necessary to make the plan executable.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The recurring issue is that the provided configurations are either unreachable or in collision. This suggests that the environment or the robot's movement capabilities (implicitly tied to reachability) are more constrained than initially assumed, or that my chosen coordinates for the continuous parameters are not ideal. The `not reachable for robot base` error is particularly challenging as it doesn't give specific collision details, but rather indicates the kinematic limits or path planning constraints.
           
           Let's re-examine the AABBs and initial rover positions to find better, more conservative configurations.
           
           **Rover V14:** Starts at `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)`.
           *   **Imaging objectives:**
               *   `v17`: `(-2.201, 1.939)` to `(-2.117, 2.023)`. To image this, v14 needs to move significantly in Y (from -1.75 to ~1.9) and slightly in X. Let's try a position *closer* to its current X, but still offering line of sight. Maybe `(-1.5, 0.5)`. This is closer in X to v14's start, and in Y to v17.
               *   `v18`: `(2.121, 1.982)` to `(2.22, 2.08)`. This is very far from v14's starting X of -1.0. Reaching this target might be the bottleneck. If v14 has to travel from x=-1.0 to x=2.1, it's a long movement. Let's try a more central X position that might be reachable for imaging multiple targets, like `(0.0, 1.0)`. This still means a large Y movement. Let's try a position in the upper right quadrant for v18. Since v14 starts at (-1.0, -1.75), moving to (1.5, 1.0) might be a problem for reachability. Let's try to stay within X bounds that are closer to the rover's starting X, if possible, or very near the target if the targets are far apart. Given `v18` is far right, perhaps rover v12 (starting at `(1.0, -1.75)`) is better suited for `v18`.
               *   `v19`: `(-0.508, 1.955)` to `(-0.409, 2.054)`. Similar to v17, a large Y movement. Let's try `(-0.5, 0.5)`.
           *   **Communicating with `v9`:** Lander `v9` is `(-2.405, -2.346)` to `(-1.395, -1.654)`.
               *   V14 is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. A position very close to `v9` but not colliding, e.g., `(-1.0, -1.5)`. The previous `(-1.8, -1.0)` was unreachable for v14. Let's try to keep the Y coordinate close to v14's starting Y or within the bounds of v9. Maybe `(-1.0, -1.5)` or `(-1.5, -1.5)`. The lander's Y max is -1.654, so -1.5 is just above it. This should be okay. Let's try `(-1.5, -1.5)`. This has the X between the min/max of v9, and Y above.
           
           **Rover V12:** Starts at `v13 = (1.0, -1.75)`.
           *   **Sampling rocks:**
               *   `v1` (rock, `(0.844, -0.628)` to `(0.946, -0.526)`). V12 is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. To be above v1, a position like `(0.9, -0.6)` should work. Previous `(0.9, -0.5)` might have been just slightly off. Let's try `(0.9, -0.6)`.
               *   `v5` (rock, `(0.643, 1.21)` to `(0.762, 1.328)`). V12 is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. To be above v5, a position like `(0.7, 1.25)` should work. Previous `(0.7, 1.3)` might have been slightly off.
           *   **Communicating with `v9`:** Lander `v9` is `(-2.405, -2.346)` to `(-1.395, -1.654)`.
               *   V12 is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. This is far from v9. It needs to move to the left. Previous `(-1.5, -2.0)` was a collision with `v9`. We need to be close to `v9` but not collide. The lander `v9` occupies `[-2.4, -1.39]` in X and `[-2.34, -1.65]` in Y. `(-1.5, -2.0)` is *inside* v9's bounding box.
               *   To be collision-free from `v9`, we need to pick a position *outside* its AABB, but within communication range (max distance 4).
               *   Let's try a position to the right of `v9`: `(-1.3, -2.0)`. Or perhaps slightly below: `(-1.8, -2.4)`. The x-coordinate of `v12` will need to be `x < -1.395` or `x > -2.405`. Let's use `(-1.0, -2.0)`. The `v20` collision might have been for a different `(-1.0, -2.0)` as in the prior round of feedback. The `v20` AABB is `(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0)` to `(0.05, 2.5, 0.1)`. So `(-1.0, -2.0)` is clear of `v20`. This position is also outside `v9`'s bounding box and within communication range.
           
           Let's adjust the plan and configurations with these revised values.
           
           The plan structure will remain the same. The key is to find valid `(x, y)` for `#o3`, `#o5`, `#o0` for each specific (rover, target) pair.
           
           **Rover v14 Plan (Imaging & Communication):**
           Starting at `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)`
           1.  Move to `#o3_v17` `(-1.5, 0.5)` to image `v17`.
           2.  Calibrate and take image of `v17`.
           3.  Move to `#o3_v18` `(1.8, 0.5)` to image `v18`. (This is far, but let's see if it's reachable. If not, v12 might have to image v18).
           4.  Calibrate and take image of `v18`.
           5.  Move to `#o3_v19` `(-0.5, 0.5)` to image `v19`.
           6.  Calibrate and take image of `v19`.
           7.  Move to `#o0_v14_v9` `(-1.5, -1.5)` to communicate with `v9`.
           8.  Send images.
           
           **Rover v12 Plan (Sampling & Communication):**
           Starting at `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)`
           1.  Move to `#o5_v1` `(0.9, -0.6)` to sample `v1`.
           2.  Sample rock `v1`.
           3.  Move to `#o5_v5` `(0.7, 1.25)` to sample `v5`.
           4.  Sample rock `v5`.
           5.  Move to `#o0_v12_v9` `(-1.0, -2.0)` to communicate with `v9`.
           6.  Send analysis.
           
           It is critical that the x,y values for #o0, #o3, #o5 are different for each (rover, target, ray) tuple as the problem statement explicitly allows this. The use of the generic `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` in the PDDL actions implies that the system will resolve them to the specific value provided in `--Configurations--`.

Model:     The persistent issues with reachability and collisions indicate that my chosen coordinates are still problematic, likely due to a misunderstanding of the robot's kinematic limits, or the environment's full complexity. The "not reachable for robot base" is the most difficult to debug without more information on the robot's specific kinematics. However, I must keep trying.
           
           Let's carefully analyze the AABBs of obstacles and targets, and the initial rover positions:
           
           **Obstacles:**
           *   `v9` (lander): `X: [-2.405, -1.395]`, `Y: [-2.346, -1.654]`
           *   `v20`: `X: [-0.05, 0.05]`, `Y: [-2.5, 2.5]` (This is a thin vertical wall along the Y-axis at X=0)
           *   `v21`: `X: [1.713, 1.847]`, `Y: [0.271, 0.405]` (A small obstacle in the upper-right quadrant)
           
           **Rover initial positions:**
           *   `v14` (rover 1): `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)`
           *   `v12` (rover 2): `v13 = (1.0, -1.75)`
           
           **Targets (Objectives/Rocks):**
           *   `v17` (objective): `X: [-2.201, -2.117]`, `Y: [1.939, 2.023]` (Far left, far top)
           *   `v18` (objective): `X: [2.121, 2.22]`, `Y: [1.982, 2.08]` (Far right, far top)
           *   `v19` (objective): `X: [-0.508, -0.409]`, `Y: [1.955, 2.054]` (Mid-left, far top)
           *   `v1` (rock, type v2): `X: [0.844, 0.946]`, `Y: [-0.628, -0.526]` (Mid-right, mid-bottom)
           *   `v5` (rock, type v6): `X: [0.643, 0.762]`, `Y: [1.21, 1.328]` (Mid-right, mid-top)
           
           **Key Insights & Strategy:**
           
           1.  **Reachability and Movement:** The "not reachable" errors are the most critical. This might imply that the rovers cannot move freely across the entire map, or have specific turning radius/movement constraints. To maximize the chance of reachability, I will try to place the continuous configurations as *close as possible* to the rover's initial positions, while still satisfying line-of-sight for imaging/communication or being "above" for sampling. Also, trying to minimize large X or Y movements might help.
           
           2.  **Imaging Targets (v17, v18, v19):** These targets are all located at high Y values (`~2.0`). This requires a significant positive Y movement for both rovers.
               *   `v14` (starts `x=-1.0`): Best for `v17` (x~-2.2), `v19` (x~-0.5). `v18` (x~2.1) is very far for `v14`.
               *   `v12` (starts `x=1.0`): Best for `v18` (x~2.1), `v5` (rock, x~0.7). `v1` (rock, x~0.9).
           
               *Let's try to assign tasks more optimally based on proximity:*
               *   **Rover v14** (`x=-1.0`): Image `v17`, `v19`. Send all images.
               *   **Rover v12** (`x=1.0`): Image `v18`. Sample `v1`, `v5`. Send all analysis.
           
               This means one rover sends all images, and the other sends all analysis, and we need to ensure they can both communicate with v9.
           
           3.  **Communication with `v9`:** `v9` is at `X: [-2.405, -1.395]`, `Y: [-2.346, -1.654]`.
               *   For **v14** (`x=-1.0, y=-1.75`): `(-1.5, -1.5)` collided with `v9`. We need to be outside `v9`'s bounding box.
                   *   To the right of `v9`: `X > -1.395`. Let's try `(-1.0, -2.0)`. This is clear of `v9` and `v20`.
               *   For **v12** (`x=1.0, y=-1.75`): `(-1.0, -2.0)` was unreachable. This is odd, as `v12` starts at `x=1.0` and can reach `x=-1.0`. `(-1.0, -2.0)` is clear of `v9` and `v20`. Perhaps the Y movement is the issue or the path in between. Let's try to position `v12` for communication closer to its current Y, and still clear of `v9`. Maybe `(-1.0, -1.5)`. This is clear of `v9` and `v20`.
           
           4.  **Sampling Rocks (`v1`, `v5`):**
               *   `v12` (`x=1.0, y=-1.75`) will sample.
               *   `v1` (rock, `x~0.9, y~-0.6`): `(0.9, -0.6)` was unreachable. This is very close to v12's start. Let's try to stay as close as possible in X, and only move in Y. `(1.0, -0.6)` (directly above `v1` but using v12's starting X).
               *   `v5` (rock, `x~0.7, y~1.2`): `(0.7, 1.25)` was unreachable. Let's try `(1.0, 1.25)`.
           
           **Revised Plan with adjusted configurations:**
           
           **Rover v14 (Imaging v17, v19; Send all images):**
           Initial `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)`
           1.  Move to `#o3_v17` `(-2.0, 0.0)` for `v17` (from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-2.0, 0.0)`). Large Y movement, but X change is small.
           2.  Calibrate and `take_image` of `v17`.
           3.  Move to `#o3_v19` `(-0.5, 0.0)` for `v19`. (Smaller X movement from previous point, same Y).
           4.  Calibrate and `take_image` of `v19`.
           5.  Move to `#o0_v14_v9` `(-1.0, -2.0)` to communicate. (From `(-0.5, 0.0)` to `(-1.0, -2.0)`).
           6.  `send_image` for `v17`, `v18`, `v19`. (This implies `v18` image needs to be taken by v12 and somehow shared or v14 must image it too - but the problem statement implies image data is specific to rover. So v14 must image v18).
           
           This brings us back to the issue of `v18` (`x~2.1`) being far from `v14` (`x=-1.0`). Let's rethink. If *one* rover must send *all* images, then that rover must *take* all images. Thus, `v14` must image `v18`.
           For `v18` `(x~2.1, y~2.0)`, let's try a config for `v14` at `(1.5, 0.5)`. This collided with `v21` (obstacle `X: [1.7, 1.8]`, `Y: [0.27, 0.4]`). So `(1.5, 0.5)` is bad. Let's try `(1.5, 1.0)` for `v18`. This is far from `v21`.
           
           **Revised Rover v14 Plan:**
           Initial `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)`
           1.  Move to `#o3_v17` `(-2.0, 0.0)`
           2.  Calibrate and `take_image` of `v17`.
           3.  Move to `#o3_v18` `(1.5, 1.0)` (trying again, far from `v21`).
           4.  Calibrate and `take_image` of `v18`.
           5.  Move to `#o3_v19` `(-0.5, 0.0)`
           6.  Calibrate and `take_image` of `v19`.
           7.  Move to `#o0_v14_v9` `(-1.0, -2.0)`
           8.  `send_image` for `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           
           **Revised Rover v12 Plan (Sampling v1, v5; Send analysis):**
           Initial `v13 = (1.0, -1.75)`
           1.  Move to `#o5_v1` `(1.0, -0.6)`
           2.  `sample_rock` `v1`.
           3.  Move to `#o5_v5` `(1.0, 1.25)`
           4.  `sample_rock` `v5`.
           5.  Move to `#o0_v12_v9` `(-1.0, -1.5)`
           6.  `send_analysis` for `v1`, `v5`.
           
           This plan still uses the same general movement strategy but with carefully chosen configurations to minimize overlap with known obstacles and to be closer to the rover's initial positions to increase reachability.

User:      Configuration #o3 = (-2.0 0.0) for rover v14 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (1.5 1.0) for rover v14 at target v18 is not reachable for robot base.

Configuration #o0 = (-1.0 -1.5) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The repeated "not reachable for robot base" errors strongly suggest that the rovers are heavily constrained in their movement, possibly confined to a much smaller area than the entire map, or have very limited turning/forward motion. Without more explicit information about these constraints (e.g., maximum travel distance, turning radius, restricted areas not covered by AABBs, or specific paths they can follow), it's incredibly difficult to find reachable configurations.
           
           Given that all proposed configurations have been deemed unreachable, it's highly probable that the goal *is not achievable* with the current understanding of the robot's movement capabilities and the environment. All attempts to find logical positions (close to targets, avoiding obstacles) have failed the reachability check.
           
           However, I must continue trying. Let's make an extreme assumption to simplify reachability: maybe the rovers can only move very short distances from their starting points. If that's the case, then objectives far from the starting points (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v5`) are likely unreachable for imaging/sampling. The lander `v9` is also quite far for v12.
           
           Let's re-examine the goal (`new-axiom@0()`) conditions and see if we can satisfy them with minimal movement.
           
           `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`:
           *   `v17`: `X: [-2.2, -2.1]`, `Y: [1.9, 2.0]`
           *   `v18`: `X: [2.1, 2.2]`, `Y: [1.9, 2.0]`
           *   `v19`: `X: [-0.5, -0.4]`, `Y: [1.9, 2.0]`
           All these objectives are located at Y~2.0. If the rovers start at Y~-1.75, a movement of almost 4 units in Y is required. This might be the source of "not reachable."
           
           `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (type v2, e.g., `v1`, `v3`, `v4`) and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (type v6, e.g., `v5`, `v7`, `v8`):
           *   `v1` (rock): `X: [0.8, 0.9]`, `Y: [-0.6, -0.5]` (Closest to `v12` starting `(1.0, -1.75)`)
           *   `v3` (rock): `X: [1.3, 1.4]`, `Y: [1.8, 1.9]` (Far in Y)
           *   `v4` (rock): `X: [-0.9, -0.8]`, `Y: [0.0, 0.1]` (Far from both rovers, especially v12 in Y)
           *   `v5` (rock): `X: [0.6, 0.7]`, `Y: [1.2, 1.3]` (Far in Y)
           *   `v7` (rock): `X: [-0.5, -0.3]`, `Y: [0.2, 0.3]` (Far from both rovers)
           *   `v8` (rock): `X: [1.0, 1.1]`, `Y: [-1.2, -1.1]` (Closest to `v12` starting `(1.0, -1.75)`)
           
           If large Y movements are the problem, then imaging `v17`, `v18`, `v19` and sampling `v3`, `v5` will be impossible. This would make the goal unreachable.
           
           However, the problem statement requires me to provide a plan if possible. Let's *assume* the rovers can move along the X-axis more easily than the Y-axis, or that very small Y-movements are acceptable.
           
           Let's pick alternative rocks that are closer in Y to the rovers' starting positions.
           For `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: `v1` (type v2) is at `Y: [-0.6, -0.5]`. `v12` starts at `Y: -1.75`. This requires a Y movement of ~1.2 units.
           For `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: `v8` (type v6) is at `Y: [-1.2, -1.1]`. `v12` starts at `Y: -1.75`. This requires a Y movement of ~0.6 units. This is the smallest Y movement for any rock sample.
           So, let's target `v1` and `v8` for sampling using `v12`.
           
           **Revised Configuration Strategy (Minimal Y-movement for sampling, minimal X-movement otherwise):**
           
           *   **Rover v12** (starts `(1.0, -1.75)`):
               *   Sample `v8` (soil): `v8` is `(1.0, -1.2)`. Place `#o5_v8` at `(1.0, -1.2)`. (Minimal Y change).
               *   Sample `v1` (stone): `v1` is `(0.9, -0.6)`. Place `#o5_v1` at `(1.0, -0.6)`. (Minimal Y change).
               *   Communicate with `v9`: `v9` is `X: [-2.4, -1.3]`. `v12` starts at `X=1.0`. Requires large X movement. Let's try to put `v12` as close as possible to its starting Y but far left: `(-1.0, -1.5)`. This was "unreachable" previously. Let's try `(-1.0, -1.0)` to see if moving above the lander's Y range and further from the `v20` wall helps with reachability.
           *   **Rover v14** (starts `(-1.0, -1.75)`):
               *   Image `v17` (`X: [-2.2, -2.1]`, `Y: [1.9, 2.0]`). A huge Y jump. It's unlikely. Maybe the `imagevisible` predicate is for very high configurations, but the base cannot reach.
               *   Image `v18` (`X: [2.1, 2.2]`, `Y: [1.9, 2.0]`). Another huge Y jump, and large X for v14.
               *   Image `v19` (`X: [-0.5, -0.4]`, `Y: [1.9, 2.0]`). Another huge Y jump.
               *   Given the repeated "not reachable" for high Y coordinates, it is highly likely that imaging these objectives is impossible. If `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)` cannot be satisfied, then the goal is unreachable.
           
               Let's assume there must be a way and try configurations that are as central as possible in X for imaging the far-Y targets, hoping the path planner can find a way. For `v14` imaging, a central X point like `(0.0, 0.0)` for all images, then move closer to objectives if needed. But imagevisible requires direct line of sight.
           
           Let's try to make the intermediate coordinates `(x, y)` closer to the rover's initial positions, but still allow line-of-sight. The "reachable" constraint is the most difficult one.
           
           Let's pick a general configuration in the middle of the map that might be reachable and can see multiple objectives for imaging. Let's try `(0.0, 0.0)` for `#o3` (imaging) and `(0.0, -1.0)` for `#o0` (communication), and `(0.0, 0.0)` for `#o5` (sampling). These are "neutral" positions, hopefully more reachable. However, line-of-sight and "above" requirements still apply.
           
           This is a tough one. The error messages about reachability with no specific collision points are hard to interpret. I am forced to try coordinates that are "safe" from AABB collisions but might still be kinematically impossible.
           
           Let's try to make configurations closer to the *targets themselves* rather than the rover's starting point, and see if the path planner can connect the dots.
           
           **Re-Attempt with Rover v14 Imaging and v12 Sampling:**
           
           **Rover v14 (Imaging v17, v18, v19; Send all images):**
           Initial `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)`
           *   `v17`: `X: [-2.2, -2.1]`, `Y: [1.9, 2.0]`. Try `#o3_v17` `(-2.0, 1.5)`. This is near `v17`.
           *   `v18`: `X: [2.1, 2.2]`, `Y: [1.9, 2.0]`. Try `#o3_v18` `(2.0, 1.5)`. This is near `v18`.
           *   `v19`: `X: [-0.5, -0.4]`, `Y: [1.9, 2.0]`. Try `#o3_v19` `(-0.5, 1.5)`. This is near `v19`.
           *   `v9` (lander): `X: [-2.4, -1.3]`, `Y: [-2.3, -1.6]`. Try `#o0_v14_v9` `(-1.0, -1.5)`. This was unreachable for v12 before, but let's try for v14. It is near v14's start and close to v9.
           
           **Rover v12 (Sampling v1, v8; Send all analysis):**
           Initial `v13 = (1.0, -1.75)`
           *   `v1` (rock): `X: [0.8, 0.9]`, `Y: [-0.6, -0.5]`. Try `#o5_v1` `(0.9, -0.6)`. This is directly above `v1`.
           *   `v8` (rock): `X: [1.0, 1.1]`, `Y: [-1.2, -1.1]`. Try `#o5_v8` `(1.0, -1.2)`. This is directly above `v8`.
           *   `v9` (lander): `X: [-2.4, -1.3]`, `Y: [-2.3, -1.6]`. Try `#o0_v12_v9` `(-1.5, -1.0)`. This is far from v12's start, but it's clear of `v9` and `v20`.
           
           This approach puts the rover at configurations that are geometrically logical for the task (near target, above rock, near lander and clear of obstacles), and assumes the path planner can find a way.

Model:     This is an incredibly difficult situation. Every single proposed configuration has been deemed unreachable for the robot base, or in collision. This strongly suggests that the problem, as presented, might be unsolvable with the given robot capabilities or environmental constraints. The "not reachable for robot base" error without further detail on the kinematic model or movement restrictions is a black box. It implies that the chosen `(x, y)` coordinate, while potentially free of static obstacles, cannot be reached by the robot from its starting position, possibly due to joint limits, maximum travel distance, or other path planning failures.
           
           Given that I must not give up, and assuming that a solution *must* exist, I have to re-evaluate the core assumptions.
           1.  **"Not reachable" implies large movements are the problem.** The robot likely has a very constrained movement envelope.
           2.  **Obstacle `v20` (thin wall at x=0):** This wall cuts the map. Rovers may have difficulty crossing it or reaching points on the opposite side, especially if movement is restricted.
           3.  **Lander `v9` location:** `X: [-2.405, -1.395]`, `Y: [-2.346, -1.654]`. Both rovers need to communicate with this.
               *   `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. `v9` is to its left.
               *   `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`. `v9` is far to its left, past `v20`. This means `v12` moving to `v9`'s side is a large movement and involves crossing the X=0 line.
           
           **Hypothesis:** The rovers might be primarily restricted to their initial X-halves of the map, or at least very limited in crossing the X=0 barrier, and also limited in Y-movement.
           
           Let's rethink task assignment and configurations under this extreme constraint:
           
           **Rover v14 (starts `(-1.0, -1.75)` - Left Half of Map, near `v9`):**
           *   **Images:** `v17` (`X: [-2.2, -2.1]`, `Y: [1.9, 2.0]`) and `v19` (`X: [-0.5, -0.4]`, `Y: [1.9, 2.0]`).
               *   These still require large Y movements. If Y movement is fundamentally impossible beyond a small range, the goal of imaging these is unachievable for *any* rover. Let's try placing imaging configs at a Y that is just slightly above the rover's initial Y, but still providing a line of sight (perhaps a tall camera). Let's try `Y=0.0` or `Y=0.5` again, but this time very close to the rover's starting X.
               *   `#o3_v17`: `(-1.0, 0.0)`. This might give line of sight to `v17` if the camera is high, and is only a Y movement of 1.75.
               *   `#o3_v19`: `(-0.5, 0.0)`. This is very close to `v19`'s X-coordinate, and `Y=0.0`.
               *   `v18` (`X: [2.1, 2.2]`, `Y: [1.9, 2.0]`) is on the *right* side of `v20`. `v14` trying to image it would require crossing `v20` AND a huge Y movement. This is highly unlikely to be reachable.
               *   **New Plan:** Assume `v14` cannot image `v18`. Rover `v12` must image `v18`.
           
           *   **Communicate with `v9`:** `v14` is already on the left side of the map and close to `v9`.
               *   `#o0_v14_v9`: `(-1.0, -1.5)`. This was unreachable before. The `v9` AABB is `Y: [-2.346, -1.654]`. `(-1.0, -1.5)` is *above* `v9`. This looks fine geometry-wise. If it's unreachable, it might be too far "up" in Y from the rover's starting Y. Let's try to stay closer to the rover's starting Y, but clear of `v9`. How about `(-1.0, -2.0)`? This is clear of `v9` in Y, and X is within `v9`'s range but clear of the specific `v22` obstacle that was mentioned last round. The `v22` obstacle is `X: [-1.45, -1.31]`, `Y: [-0.89, -0.75]`. So `(-1.0, -2.0)` is clear of `v22`.
           
           **Rover v12 (starts `(1.0, -1.75)` - Right Half of Map):**
           *   **Images:** `v18` (`X: [2.1, 2.2]`, `Y: [1.9, 2.0]`).
               *   `#o3_v18`: `(1.0, 0.0)`. Same logic as for `v14` imaging. This is only a Y movement of 1.75.
           *   **Samples:** `v1` (stone, `X: [0.8, 0.9]`, `Y: [-0.6, -0.5]`) and `v8` (soil, `X: [1.0, 1.1]`, `Y: [-1.2, -1.1]`). These are on the right side and have relatively small Y movements.
               *   `#o5_v1`: `(0.9, -0.6)`. Direct above `v1`.
               *   `#o5_v8`: `(1.0, -1.2)`. Direct above `v8`.
           *   **Communicate with `v9`:** `v12` is on the right side. `v9` is on the far left. This requires crossing `v20`. This is where `v12` has failed before.
               *   **This is the critical point.** If `v12` cannot cross to the left side to communicate with `v9`, then `receivedanalysis` cannot be achieved by `v12`.
               *   If `v12` *must* communicate with `v9`, then it needs to reach a configuration like `(-1.0, -1.5)` (which was unreachable) or `(-1.5, -1.0)` (which collided with `v22`).
               *   Let's try to find a spot for `v12` near `v9` that is *not* in collision with `v22`. `v22` is at `X: [-1.45, -1.31]`. So `X=-1.5` is fine. `v22` is at `Y: [-0.89, -0.75]`. So `Y=-1.0` or `Y=-2.0` is fine.
               *   Let's retry `#o0_v12_v9` at `(-1.5, -2.0)`. This was in collision with `v9` earlier, but maybe the previous geometry was different. Re-checking `v9` AABB `Y: [-2.346, -1.654]`. `(-1.5, -2.0)` is inside `v9`'s AABB.
               *   Let's try a communication position that is just to the right of `v9` and clear of `v20`. E.g., `(-1.3, -2.0)`. This is `X > -1.395`, so it's to the right of `v9`. It is clear of `v20`. And it's outside `v9`'s Y range. This could be a good candidate for `v12` to communicate.
           
           **Refined Plan (Task distribution and new coordinates):**
           
           **Rover v14 (Image v17, v19; Send all images; also send v18 image if v12 images it):**
           This is becoming tricky. The goal is `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`. It doesn't say *which* rover images them. Also `haveimage` is per rover. So if v12 images v18, v12 has to send it. This implies that the current single-rover-for-all-images strategy might not be working.
           
           Let's try **Rover v14 images v17, v19 and sends them.**
           **Rover v12 images v18, samples v1, v8 and sends them.**
           
           This means `receivedimage(v18, v11)` would be achieved by `v12`. This is allowed by the axiom.
           
           **Rover v14 Plan:**
           Initial `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)`
           1.  Move to `#o3_v17` `(-1.0, 0.0)` for `v17`.
           2.  Calibrate and `take_image` of `v17`.
           3.  Move to `#o3_v19` `(-0.5, 0.0)` for `v19`.
           4.  Calibrate and `take_image` of `v19`.
           5.  Move to `#o0_v14_v9` `(-1.0, -2.0)` to communicate. (Clear of `v9`, `v20`, `v22`).
           6.  `send_image` for `v17`, `v19`.
           
           **Rover v12 Plan:**
           Initial `v13 = (1.0, -1.75)`
           1.  Move to `#o3_v18` `(1.0, 0.0)` for `v18`.
           2.  Calibrate and `take_image` of `v18`.
           3.  Move to `#o5_v1` `(0.9, -0.6)` to sample `v1`.
           4.  `sample_rock` `v1`.
           5.  Move to `#o5_v8` `(1.0, -1.2)` to sample `v8`.
           6.  `sample_rock` `v8`.
           7.  Move to `#o0_v12_v9` `(-1.3, -2.0)` to communicate. (Clear of `v9`, `v20`, `v22`).
           8.  `send_image` for `v18`.
           9.  `send_analysis` for `v1`, `v8`.
           
           This distribution of tasks seems more robust given the `v20` wall and the far-apart objectives. The coordinates are chosen to minimize Y-movement where possible, stay clear of AABBs, and keep X movements within reasonable bounds for each rover's starting side.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     At this point, it's clear that the "not reachable for robot base" constraint is extremely stringent and is preventing any proposed configuration from being valid, regardless of how geometrically sound it appears to be. This usually indicates one of two things:
           1.  **The robot has extremely limited movement capabilities** that are not explicitly detailed (e.g., it can only pivot, or move along very specific rails, or has a tiny workspace).
           2.  **The problem is actually unsolvable** under the current interpretation of the robot's movement, and the continuous parameter solver is unable to find any valid path/pose.
           
           The final collision for `v12` at `(-1.3, -2.0)` with `v9` is also critical. `v9`'s X-range is `[-2.4047, -1.3953]`. A coordinate `X=-1.3` is *just* outside the right edge of `v9`. Its Y-range is `[-2.3455, -1.6545]`. A coordinate `Y=-2.0` is *inside* `v9`'s Y range. Therefore, `(-1.3, -2.0)` is indeed in collision with `v9`. My prior assessment that it was "clear of v9" was incorrect.
           
           Given these continuous failures, I have to conclude that a plan satisfying all conditions (especially reachability) **cannot be found under the given constraints**. If the robot cannot even move to positions near its starting location, or to positions clearly outside obstacles but within functional range of targets, then no sequence of actions will work. The "not reachable" errors on almost every point, combined with the fact that these points are selected to minimize travel and avoid explicit obstacles, strongly suggest an unsolvable scenario for my current approach.
           
           Therefore, I will state that the goal is unreachable.
           
           The goal is unreachable from the initial state. The primary reason is that all attempted continuous configurations for the rovers to perform tasks (imaging, sampling, communication) have been consistently rejected as "not reachable for robot base." This implies severe limitations on the robot's movement capabilities, such as an extremely small workspace or highly constrained paths, which are not explicitly defined in the problem description. Additionally, some configurations also resulted in collisions with fixed obstacles, further narrowing the already limited valid space. Without a more flexible robot model or relaxed movement constraints, the rovers cannot reach the necessary locations to execute the required actions to achieve the goal state.
