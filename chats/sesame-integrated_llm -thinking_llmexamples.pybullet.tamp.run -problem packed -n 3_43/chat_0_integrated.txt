           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.236, 0.317, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.991, -0.132).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.021, 0.333, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.732, 0.682).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.297, -0.424), (-0.203, -0.33)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.279, 0.274), (-0.193, 0.359)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.059, 0.296), (0.016, 0.371)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.25, -0.377, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.234, 0.972).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Object Manipulation**
           
           Okay, so I'm looking at this problem, and it's pretty straightforward, but let's break it down to make sure we're covering all the bases. The main goal is to get objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto surface `v16`. Currently, they're sitting on `v11`, and I need to use the robot with two arms, v4 and v6.
           
           1. **Understanding the Goal:** The objective, `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`, translates to: each object needs to be *supported* by `v16` and be at a *specific pose* on that surface. Essentially, I need to pick them up from where they are and place them onto `v16`.
           
           2. **The Current State:** Right now, the robot's base is at `v3`, which is at `(-1.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. The robot can move. The objects are initially at these poses:
              - `v8` at `v9`: (-0.25, -0.377, 0.781) on `v11`
              - `v12` at `v13`: (-0.021, 0.333, 0.781) on `v11`
              - `v14` at `v15`: (-0.236, 0.317, 0.781) on `v11`
           
           3. **Required Actions:**
              - **Base Movement:** First, the robot's base has to be moved to `bconf #o3`.  This is because all of the pick and place actions use base config `#o3`.
              - **Picking and Placing:** For each object, I'll need a *pick* and a *place* action.  Crucially, I have to ensure there is no obstruction at the poses.  `v4` is the only arm used for planning, so it's the one I'll use.
                - Pick `v8` from `v9` with `v4`.
                - Place `v8` at `#o2` on `v16`.
                - Pick `v12` from `v13` with `v4`.
                - Place `v12` at `#o2` on `v16`.
                - Pick `v14` from `v15` with `v4`.
                - Place `v14` at `#o2` on `v16`.
           
           4. **Continuous Values:**  Since the plan requires poses starting with "#", I have to provide specific, concrete values for these poses.
              - For `bconf #o3`, I'll use `(-0.5, 0.0, 0.0)`.
              - For placing the objects on the surface, I need different coordinates so the objects are not overlapping. I will set the Z-coord to be `0.781` for all the objects, as that's the current height on `v11` and should work for `v16` as well:
                 - For `v8`, I'll use the coordinate `(-0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)`.
                 - For `v12`, I'll use the coordinate `(0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)`.
                 - For `v14`, I'll use the coordinate `(0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           
           5. **Putting It Together:** The plan will be:
              1. `move_base(v3, #o3, #o0)`  (This moves the base)
              2. `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)` (Picks up the first object)
              3. `place(v4, v8, #o2_v8, #o1, #o3, #o4)` (Places the first object)
              4. `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)` (Picks up the second object)
              5. `place(v4, v12, #
)

                - Pick `v12` from `v13` with `v4`.
                - Place `v12` at `#o2` on `v16`.
                - Pick `v14` from `v15` with `v4`.
                - Place `v14` at `#o2` on `v16`.
