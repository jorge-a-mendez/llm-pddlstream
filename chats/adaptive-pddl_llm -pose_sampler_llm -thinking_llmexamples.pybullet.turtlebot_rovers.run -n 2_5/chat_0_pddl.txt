User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Candidate Robot Base Positions for Target (-1.0, 0.0)**
           
           Okay, here's my thought process for finding three suitable robot base positions. The environment is a square room, but it's effectively split in two by a central wall at x=0. My target is at (-1.0, 0.0), placing it firmly in the left half of the room. Since I need clear line of sight, I'll prioritize positions on the same side of the central wall. I'm looking for positions within a 2-unit radius of the target, and within the robot's movement bounds of [-2.5, 2.5] for both x and y.
           
           First, I had to grasp the layout. The room's geometry is straightforward, but the central wall is critical for sightlines. I also noted some small obstacles scattered around, mostly at the top corners and bottom-left, along with smaller objects near the central wall itself.
           
           My strategy was to start with a radius of approximately 1.5, finding three good positions that are not likely to collide with obstacles or have sightlines blocked.
           
           I carefully selected these three positions by mentally checking the line of sight for each.
           
           My chosen candidates, and the reasoning behind each:
           
           *   **(Position 1): (-1.0, 1.5)**: Located directly above the target (towards the ceiling), is a strong candidate. It gives a clear line of sight, and is at a moderate distance. I verified that there were no obstacles blocking its path.
           *   **(Position 2): (-1.0, -1.5)**: Located directly below the target, is similar to position 1, and offers a good alternate view. Like the first position, it has an open line of sight, and is at a moderate distance. I found no obstructions here either.
           *   **(Position 3): (-2.27, -1.27)**: Located to the bottom-left of the target and a little further out, it provides a more diverse view and approach angle, offering clear sight of the target. I carefully checked the obstacle layout around this location and made sure there were no blocking elements.
           
           In all cases, I made sure to stay far enough left of the central wall. I believe these three positions offer diversity in approach while ensuring clear lines of sight. They are all within the required range. I have confirmed there will be no collisions with the fixed obstacles.
