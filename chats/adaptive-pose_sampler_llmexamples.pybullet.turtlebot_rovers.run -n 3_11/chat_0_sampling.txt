User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is enclosed by a large square bounding box from (-2.5, -2.5) to (2.5, 2.5). There's a central vertical wall at x=0. There are several smaller rectangular obstacles scattered throughout the scene, some forming clusters. I'll need to consider these to avoid collisions. I also need to make sure the robot can see the target, which means line-of-sight must be clear.
           
           The target point is (-0.91612733 -1.8906969). This point is to the left of the central wall. I should prioritize positions to the left of the central wall (x<0) and within 2 units distance from the target.
           
           I will try to find positions around the target point.
           The target is at (-0.916, -1.891).
           
           1.  A position directly to the left, slightly further out in X: (-2.0, -1.891). This is within the overall bounds and 2 units from the target.
           2.  A position above the target, still to the left of the central wall: (-0.916, -0.5). This is within the overall bounds and 2 units from the target.
           3.  A position below and to the left of the target: (-1.5, -2.5). This is within the overall bounds and 2 units from the target.
           
           Let's check for fixed obstacles.
           Obstacle 6 is (( -2.4047, -2.3455502384913305), (-1.3952999999999998, -1.6544497615086693)).
           The target point is at (-0.916, -1.891), which is not within this obstacle.
           Proposed position 1: (-2.0, -1.891). This falls within Obstacle 6. This is a bad position.
           Proposed position 2: (-0.916, -0.5). This is not within any listed obstacle.
           Proposed position 3: (-1.5, -2.5). This falls within Obstacle 6. This is a bad position.
           
           I need new positions.
           
           Let's try:
           1.  Target: (-0.916, -1.891).
               Try a point slightly to the right of the target, moving away from Obstacle 6. For example, (-0.5, -1.891). This is within the range of 2. It is also not within Obstacle 13 ((-0.536, -1.891), (-0.413, -1.769)). This looks promising.
           2.  Try a point above the target, to the left of the central wall, but not too close to the obstacles around y=1.75-2.25. Let's try (-1.5, -0.5). This is also within range.
           3.  Try a point directly above the target but further away from obstacle 13, for example: (-0.916, -1.0).
           
           Positions:
           (-0.5 -1.891)
           (-1.5 -0.5)
           (-0.916 -1.0)

           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     My apologies, it seems I misinterpreted the target point in the previous iteration and provided positions for a different target. I will correct this and use the *actual* target point.
           
           The *actual* target point is (0.372623085975647, 1.891413688659668).
           All previous proposed positions (-0.5, -1.891), (-1.5, -0.5), and (-0.916, -1.0) were for a different target. They failed for the target (0.372623085975647, 1.891413688659668) due to collisions or no line of sight, which makes sense as they were far from the current target. I will use the *current* target to find new positions.
           
           The target is at (0.373, 1.891). This is in the top-right quadrant, just to the right of the central wall (x=0). There are several obstacles around this area, particularly:
           *   9: ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)) - The target (0.373, 1.891) is *inside* this obstacle. This is problematic if the target itself is inside a fixed obstacle, which means the robot probably cannot see it directly from within the obstacle. However, the problem statement says "find a base position ... to view a target object", implying the target itself is an object, not an obstacle. Let's assume the target point is on the *surface* or *inside* of an object, and the robot needs to be outside of the *fixed obstacles* to view it.
           *   11: ((0.756, 1.061), (0.893, 1.198))
           *   12: ((0.901, 1.003), (1.039, 1.141))
           *   17: ((1.132, 1.889), (1.243, 1.999))
           *   18: ((1.539, 1.961), (1.667, 2.090))
           *   19: ((1.881, 1.954), (1.963, 2.036))
           *   21: ((0.336, 1.855), (0.408, 1.927)) - The target (0.373, 1.891) is *inside* this obstacle as well. This makes it impossible to place the robot *at* the target, and likely implies I need to be outside of this obstacle to view it.
           
           Given the target is at (0.373, 1.891), and it's within both obstacle 9 and 21, I need to find positions *outside* these obstacles but still within 2 units distance. The robot needs to be able to see the target, so I should try to place it in positions that have a direct line of sight to the target *from outside* these obstacles.
           
           Let's try to place the robot:
           1.  **To the right of obstacle 9 and 21**: The target is at x=0.373. Obstacle 9 extends to x=0.75, obstacle 21 to x=0.408. Let's try placing the robot to the right, for example, at x=1.0. For y, let's keep it close to the target's y. So, (1.0, 1.891). This is within 2 units from the target.
           2.  **Below obstacle 9 and 21**: The target is at y=1.891. Obstacle 9 starts at y=1.75, obstacle 21 at y=1.855. Let's try placing the robot below, for example, at y=1.5. For x, let's keep it close to the target's x. So, (0.373, 1.5). This is within 2 units from the target.
           3.  **To the left of obstacle 9 and 21, but to the right of x=0 (central wall)**: Obstacle 9 starts at x=0.25, obstacle 21 at x=0.336. Let's try placing the robot to the left of these, for example, at x=0.1. For y, let's keep it close to the target's y. So, (0.1, 1.891). This is within 2 units from the target.
           
           Positions:
           (1.0 1.891)
           (0.373 1.5)
           (0.1 1.891)

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     It appears there was another misunderstanding of the target point. I am now receiving the actual target point as part of the new request, which is much clearer. I will disregard the previous failed attempts for a target point I am not currently working with.
           
           The *actual* target point for this request is (-0.5833859443664551, 1.9480754137039185).
           
           Let's denote the target as T = (-0.583, 1.948). This target is in the top-left quadrant, to the left of the central wall (x=0).
           
           Let's re-examine the obstacles near this point:
           *   Obstacle 8: ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)) - This is to the left of the target.
           *   Obstacle 10: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)) - The target (-0.583, 1.948) is *inside* this obstacle. Similar to the previous misunderstanding, I need to place the robot *outside* this obstacle to view the target.
           *   Obstacle 20: ((-0.632, 1.898), (-0.533, 1.997)) - The target (-0.583, 1.948) is *also inside* this obstacle. This is a very tight area.
           
           Since the target is within Obstacle 10 and 20, I need to find positions *outside* these obstacles but within 2 units distance from the target.
           
           Obstacle 10: x range [-0.75, -0.25], y range [1.75, 2.25]
           Obstacle 20: x range [-0.632, -0.533], y range [1.898, 1.997]
           
           The target is at x=-0.583, y=1.948.
           
           Let's try to place the robot:
           1.  **To the left of obstacle 10 and 20**: Obstacle 10 extends to x=-0.75. Let's try x=-1.0. For y, let's keep it close to the target's y. So, (-1.0, 1.948). This is within 2 units from the target.
           2.  **Below obstacle 10 and 20**: Obstacle 10 starts at y=1.75. Let's try y=1.5. For x, let's keep it close to the target's x. So, (-0.583, 1.5). This is within 2 units from the target.
           3.  **To the right of obstacle 10 and 20, but to the left of x=0 (central wall)**: Obstacle 10 ends at x=-0.25. Let's try x=-0.1. For y, let's keep it close to the target's y. So, (-0.1, 1.948). This is within 2 units from the target.
           
           Positions:
           (-1.0 1.948)

Model:     I understand. It seems I made the same mistake of using the wrong target point again for the previous request. I apologize for this oversight. I will focus strictly on the *new* target point provided in *this* request. The previous failures are for a target point at (1.922, 1.995) and the proposals (-1.0, 1.948), (-0.583, 1.5), (-0.1, 1.948). The last one (-0.1, 1.948) collided with the central wall (x=0) and obstacle 10. This feedback is useful if the current target is in a similar area, but I will prioritize the new target.
           
           The *actual* target point for this request is (1.9227622747421265, 1.9956904649734497).
           Let's denote the target as T = (1.923, 1.996). This target is in the top-right quadrant.
           
           Let's re-examine the obstacles near this point:
           *   Obstacle 7: ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) - The target (1.923, 1.996) is *inside* this obstacle. This implies I need to place the robot *outside* this obstacle.
           *   Obstacle 18: ((1.539, 1.961), (1.667, 2.090)) - This is to the left of the target, and near it.
           *   Obstacle 19: ((1.881, 1.954), (1.963, 2.036)) - The target (1.923, 1.996) is *inside* this obstacle. This is a very tight spot, with the target contained in two fixed obstacles.
           
           The target is at x=1.923, y=1.996.
           Obstacle 7: x range [1.75, 2.25], y range [1.75, 2.25]
           Obstacle 19: x range [1.881, 1.963], y range [1.954, 2.036]
           
           I need to find positions *outside* these obstacles, particularly 7 and 19, and still within 2 units distance from the target.
           
           Let's try to place the robot:
           1.  **To the right of obstacle 7 and 19**: Obstacle 7 extends to x=2.25. Let's try x=2.4. For y, let's keep it close to the target's y. So, (2.4, 1.996). This is within 2 units from the target (dist((2.4, 1.996), (1.923, 1.996)) = 0.477 < 2).
           2.  **Below obstacle 7 and 19**: Obstacle 7 starts at y=1.75. Obstacle 19 starts at y=1.954. Let's try y=1.7. For x, let's keep it close to the target's x. So, (1.923, 1.7). This is within 2 units from the target (dist((1.923, 1.7), (1.923, 1.996)) = 0.296 < 2).
           3.  **To the left of obstacle 7 and 19, but avoiding obstacle 18**: Obstacle 7 starts at x=1.75. Obstacle 19 starts at x=1.881. Obstacle 18 is to the left of the target, ending at x=1.667. Let's try x=1.7. For y, let's keep it close to the target's y. So, (1.7, 1.996). This is within 2 units from the target (dist((1.7, 1.996), (1.923, 1.996)) = 0.223 < 2).
