           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **A Comprehensive Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to accomplish the goal `new-axiom@0()`, breaking down the logic and ensuring all requirements are met. It seems my task is to ensure that two rovers gather images and analyses, which I'll handle sequentially.
           
           First, I identified the crucial aspects of the goal: ensuring both `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` are accomplished. From the setup, I noted these starting conditions: I know where rovers `v12` and `v14` are (`atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`), and they're both free to act (`free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)`). Crucially, the plan relies on satisfying four key requirements: two images must be received (`receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`) and analyses of rocks (stone and soil) must also be received.
           
           I've got the data I need; specifically, I have `v1` (stone), `v3` (stone), `v4` (stone), `v5` (soil), `v7` (soil), and `v8` (soil). Now it's time to create and follow a reliable plan to ensure all the goal conditions are reached.
           
           To make the plan effective, it is a sequence of actions I'll take. I will ensure both rovers are well-equipped to perform their functions. The rover `v12` will focus on collecting and sending images, and `v14` will collect and send rock analyses.
           
           **Rover v12: Image Acquisition and Transmission**
           
           The initial state of `v12` is at `v13`. It's going to involve:
           
           1.  **Move to Image Position:**  I have to start by moving `v12` from `v13` to a location (`#o3`) from where I can collect images of the objectives (`v17` and `v18`). `move(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)`
           2.  **Calibrate the Camera:** I will calibrate the camera on `v10` using `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)`.
           3.  **Take the First Image:** I'll use the command `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`.
           4.  **Move to Communication Position:** Then I'll have to move `v12` to `(0.0, 1.0)` (`#o0`) to communicate using `move(v12, #o3, #o2, #o0)`.
           5.  **Send the Image:** I will send the first image to `v9` using the command `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`.
           6.  **Take Second Image:** `move(v12, #o0, #o2, #o3)`. I'll have to repeat step 2-4 and move again.
           
           **Rover v14: Sampling and Analysis**
           
           The initial state of `v14` is `v15`, and it's also free to act. I will need to complete the following:
           
           1.  **Sampling and analysis:**
               *   Move from the start position (`#o5`, the sampling position) using `move(v14, v15, #o2, #o5)`.
               *   I will collect data to analyze the rocks with this command `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v1, v16)`.
               *   Then, `move(v14, #o5, #o2, #o0)`.
               *   Once that rock's sample analysis is finished, I will send it by the command `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v1)`
               *   The `drop_rock(v14, v16)` helps me store and free the space.
               *   I will repeat this analysis and process for `v3, v4, v5, v7, v8`.
           
           2.  **Completing the sequence** I'll have to return both rovers to their initial positions.
               *   `move(v12, #o0,
)

           2.  **Calibrate the Camera:** I will calibrate the camera on `v10` using `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)`.
           3.  **Take the First Image:** I'll use the command `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`.
           4.  **Move to Communication Position:** Then I'll have to move `v12` to `(0.0, 1.0)` (`#o0`) to communicate using `move(v12, #o3, #o2, #o0)`.
           5.  **Send the Image:** I will send the first image to `v9` using the command `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`.
           6.  **Take Second Image:** `move(v12, #o0, #o2, #o3)`. I'll have to repeat step 2-4 and move again.
           
           **Rover v14: Sampling and Analysis**
           
           The initial state of `v14` is `v15`, and it's also free to act. I will need to complete the following:
           
           1.  **Sampling and analysis:**
               *   Move from the start position (`#o5`, the sampling position) using `move(v14, v15, #o2, #o5)`.
               *   I will collect data to analyze the rocks with this command `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v1, v16)`.
               *   Then, `move(v14, #o5, #o2, #o0)`.
               *   Once that rock's sample analysis is finished, I will send it by the command `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v1)`
               *   The `drop_rock(v14, v16)` helps me store and free the space.
               *   I will repeat this analysis and process for `v3, v4, v5, v7, v8`.
           
           2.  **Completing the sequence** I'll have to return both rovers to their initial positions.
               *   `move(v12, #o0,

(Thoughts: **Rethinking the Rover's Plan: A Collision-Free Strategy**
           
           The previous plan fell apart because our initial communication and imaging poses (`#o0` and `#o3`) were hitting obstacles. Time to revise.
           
           **First**, let's fix the communication pose. We want to talk to the lander (`v9`) at around `(-1.9, -2.0)`.  To avoid crashing, the rover can't *be* inside the lander's bounding box. I considered where the rovers start: `v12` at `(1.0, -1.75)` and `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.  For `v14` to talk to the lander, let's try `(-1.0, -1.0)`. It's close to the starting point, the lander isn't in its way, and it's within range. For `v12` it's within movement range.
           
           **Second**, let's find a better imaging spot. We're aiming to see `v17` at `(-0.5, 2.0)` and `v18` at `(0.67, 1.9)`. The previous pose, `(0.0, 1.0)`, was blocked. So I'll try `(0.5, 1.0)`. It's far enough from the obstacle and within sight of both targets. Rover `v12` can reach it from it's start.
           
           The key is that the "motion" predicates (actions) already *exist* which help the rovers go to the poses I've described: `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)` and `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o0)`. This simplifies the plan design.
           
           The core plan doesn't need to change, just the coordinate fixes.
           
           **Final Configurations:**
           
           *   `#o0` (Communication):  `(-1.0, -1.0)`. It's outside the lander's and obstacle's ranges.
           *   `#o3` (Imaging): `(0.5, 1.0)`. It's outside the obstacle's range and near the targets.
           
           The rest, making the rovers free, collecting images, and getting the soil and rock reports, should still work.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating Reachable Configurations**
           
           Okay, the previous plan failed because the robot couldn't reach certain configurations.  I think the issue is the placement of these configurations relative to the robot's starting positions and perhaps some strict reachability constraints.  I need to adjust the targets I use for communication and imaging tasks. I've got to find these new positions without running into obstacles.
           
           I'm starting with these points:  `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)` and `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           I'm going to look at my main targets:
           *   **Communicate with `v9`**: It has an AABB box ([-2.405, -2.346], [-1.395, -1.654]), so around (-1.9, -2.0) and a visibility range of 4 units.
           *   **Image Target `v17`**:  AABB ([-0.556, 1.977], [-0.457, 2.076]), so around (-0.5, 2.0) and a visibility range of 2.
           *   **Image Target `v18`**:  AABB ([0.633, 1.876], [0.71, 1.952]), so around (0.67, 1.9) and a visibility range of 2.
           *   **Obstacle `v19`**: This is a wall at x=0.
           
           **Here's the new plan:**
           
           Since I don't have a kinematic model to guide me, I'm going to rely on relative positioning to the rovers' start points and the `motion` predicates.
           
           I know I *must* provide coordinates if the tasks involve *imagevisible* or *comvisible*. Since both are in play here, I need to provide each of my object coordinates.
           
           **For Rover `v12` (starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`):**
           
           *   **Communicate with `v9`**: I'll try  `#o0 = (-0.5, -1.5)`. This should be near `v9` and avoid the x=0 wall.  The math all works out: It's within range and not blocked.
           *   **Image `v17` and `v18`**: I'll use `(0.7, 0.7)` for `#o3`.  This position allows a view of both objectives, and avoids the x=0 wall. The math confirms, it's inside the image ranges.
           
           **For Rover `v14` (starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`):**
           
           *   **Communicate with `v9`**:  I'll try using `(-1.3, -1.0)` for `#o0`. Avoids collision and inside the comm range.
           *   **Image `v17` and `v18`**:  I'll use `(-0.2, 0.7)` for `#o3`.  This is also within image range. The math all checks out.
           
           For my 'Sampling' objective (`#o5`), I don't need to specify coordinates, because it is only used by the "above" relation, not visibility.
           
           I *know* I must satisfy all the reachability criteria, which means that the distances for each object and range must be within tolerance.
           
           I've carefully checked all the new positions to make sure I am collision-free and inside the visibility ranges.

(Thoughts: **My Strategic Refinement for a Successful Mission**
           
           The user has highlighted significant issues with my original plan. Specifically, my initial configuration choices for communication and imaging poses were either unreachable or colliding. I've re-evaluated the scenario based on the provided feedback and have identified several key constraints that I must adhere to for success.
           
           The fundamental challenge stems from the path planner's difficulty in computing viable routes to the specified configurations, particularly those designated with a '#'. The constraints I'm grappling with are:
           
           1.  **Collision Avoidance:** The critical imperative is to steer clear of both the lander (`v9`) and the wall at x=0 (`v19`).
           2.  **Range Requirements:** All communications and imaging activities must occur within their specified ranges (4 units for communication and 2 units for imaging).
           3.  **Reachability:** This remains the most formidable obstacle. The system assumes, using the `motion` predicates, that any configuration is reachable if a path *exists*, but in reality, the given (x,y) coordinates might be too far, or there are implicit (or explicit) obstacles in the planning scene.
           
           Considering the geometry of the scene, I now understand that I must provide specific (x,y) coordinates for *every* (rover, target object) pair that satisfies an `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate. This means I'm no longer restricted to a single value for each object like `#o3`, and I can now plan for a "per target" pose.
           
           After a thorough geometric analysis and strategic positioning, I've redefined the following configurations:
           
           *   **Communication Pose (`#o0`):** I've chosen different points to communicate for both `v12` and `v14` at coordinates `(-0.5, -1.5)` and `(-1.3, -1.0)`, respectively. These points are within range and are reachable for all rovers, considering their initial positions and the need to avoid the lander.
           
           *   **Imaging Pose (`#o3`):** This is where it gets interesting! I'm now providing distinct configurations for `v12` for `v17` and `v18`.
               *   For `v12` to `v17`, I've chosen `(-0.6, 0.7)`.
               *   For `v12` to `v18`, I've selected `(0.7, 0.7)`.
               *   For `v14` to `v17`, I will set `#o3 = (-1.0, 0.7)`.
               *   For `v14` to `v18`, I will set `#o3 = (0.2, 0.7)`.
           
           The plan structure must be adapted to work within these parameters:
           1.  **For v12:** I will first position the rover to the correct `#o3` configuration, calibrate and take the image of `v17`, and then communicate to send it to the receiver.  I must follow this process for v18 as well.
           
           2.  **For v14:** The plan calls for sampling and dropping the rocks and communicating the data (which will require two moves to and from the communications pose).
           
           This refined plan emphasizes a focus on reachability, and will require careful planning of movement to make sure the robots never collide with objects and can image the right targets.

This means I'm no longer restricted to a single value for each object like `#o3`, and I can now plan for a "per target" pose.
           
           After a thorough geometric analysis and strategic positioning, I've redefined the following configurations:
           
           *   **Communication Pose (`#o0`):** I've chosen different points to communicate for both `v12` and `v14` at coordinates `(-0.5, -1.5)` and `(-1.3, -1.0)`, respectively. These points are within range and are reachable for all rovers, considering their initial positions and the need to avoid the lander.
           
           *   **Imaging Pose (`#o3`):** This is where it gets interesting! I'm now providing distinct configurations for `v12` for `v17` and `v18`.
               *   For `v12` to `v17`, I've chosen `(-0.6, 0.7)`.
               *   For `v12` to `v18`, I've selected `(0.7, 0.7)`.
               *   For `v14` to `v17`, I will set `#o3 = (-1.0, 0.7)`.
               *   For `v14` to `v18`, I will set `#o3 = (0.2, 0.7)`.
           
           The plan structure must be adapted to work within these parameters:
           1.  **For v12:** I will first position the rover to the correct `#o3` configuration, calibrate and take the image of `v17`, and then communicate to send it to the receiver.  I must follow this process for v18 as well.
           
           2.  **For v14:** The plan calls for sampling and dropping the rocks and communicating the data (which will require two moves to and from the communications pose).
           
           This refined plan emphasizes a focus on reachability, and will require careful planning of movement to make sure the robots never collide with objects and can image the right targets.
           

User:      Configuration #o0 = (-0.5 -1.5) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-1.3 -1.0) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **New Plan for `rovers` Domain:  Improved Configuration Strategy**
           
           The previous attempt failed due to reachability and collision issues, specifically with configurations for communication (`#o0`) and imaging (`#o3`) targets, particularly concerning the wall `v19` (x=0). I've revised my strategy, focusing on: (1) aggressively avoiding collisions with `v19` by adjusting x-coordinates, and (2) prioritizing reachability by choosing configurations closer to the rovers' starting positions (v13 and v15) if possible, while still ensuring they are within range of their intended targets and meet visibility requirements.
           
           **Key Changes:**
           
           *   **Wall Avoidance:**  Configurations involving `v14` will generally have `x >= 0.1` and those on the left should use `x <= -0.1`.
           *   **Reachability:** I'm assuming that configurations are *intended* to be reachable, so I'll try to find nearby, non-colliding coordinates.
           
           **New Configurations:**
           
           Based on this new understanding, I've calculated a new set of coordinates for the critical objects:
           
           | PDDL Object | Rover | Target Object | (x, y) coordinates | Notes |
           | :---------- | :---- | :------------ | :----------------- | :---- |
           | `#o0`       | `v12` | `v9`          | `(-0.9 -1.7)`     | Comms for v12, good range to v9, reasonable distance from v13. |
           | `#o0`       | `v14` | `v9`          | `(-1.0 -1.5)`     | Comms for v14, good range to v9, very close to v15. |
           | `#o3`       | `v12` | `v17`         | `(-0.3 0.2)`      | Image v17 (left), clear of v19, good range to v17, reasonable distance from v13. |
           | `#o3`       | `v12` | `v18`         | `(0.5 0.5)`       | Image v18 (right), clear of v19, good range to v18, reasonable distance from v13. |
           | `#o3`       | `v14` | `v17`         | `(-0.6 0.5)`      | Image v17 (left), clear of v19, good range to v17, reasonable distance from v15. |
           | `#o3`       | `v14` | `v18`         | `(0.6 0.5)`       | Image v18 (right), clear of v19, good range to v18, reasonable distance from v15. |
           
           The revised plan, now that I have these new configurations, is:
           
           `(#o0 v12 #o1 v9): (-0.9 -1.7)`
           
           `(#o3 v12 #o4 v17): (-0.3 0.2)`
           
           `(#o3 v12 #o5 v18): (0.5 0.5)`
           
           `(#o0 v14 #o1 v9): (-1.0 -1.5)`
           
           `(#o3 v14 #o4 v17): (-0.6 0.5)`
           
           `(#o3 v14 #o5 v18): (0.6 0.5)`
           
           These new coordinates are expected to avoid the previous issues while still meeting the plan's requirements.  I have also ensured that the plan's underlying action structure remains logically sound. Now, the main concern is that these newly-defined configurations will be deemed reachable by the planners used. This seems likely, given their placement.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing Reachability and Constraints**
           
           I've been wrestling with the "not reachable" errors, which are cropping up when I try to specify configurations for the rovers. I suspect the problem lies in my choice of coordinates for the continuous parameters (the ones starting with `#`). I'm pretty certain there's a disconnect between the geometric scene and the configurations I'm proposing, especially in conjunction with the motion planning constraints.
           
           The problem specifically highlights the need for collision-free configurations, reachability from the current state, and clear line-of-sight when using these continuous parameters in conjunction with `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates. Since the core challenge lies in the `#` configurations, I'm focusing my efforts on selecting locations that minimize the distance from the initial rover positions while satisfying all visibility conditions.
           
           I've got two rovers: `v12` starting at `(1.0, -1.75)` and `v14` starting at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.  I'm trying to identify configurations for them that let them see the lander `v9` for communication and the objectives `v17` and `v18` for imaging. I've calculated the distances between the rovers and potential target locations to minimize movement while maximizing visibility and collision avoidance.
           
           **The Wall Constraint**
           
           Here's the key challenge: there's a wall, `v19`, running along the y-axis, centered at x=0. The bounding box of `v19` indicates the wall is a thin barrier, spanning from y=-2.5 to y=2.5. This geometry effectively partitions the working space.  The problem is, if the wall `v19` spans the entire y-coordinate space, the rovers are trapped on their respective sides. `v12` cannot move to the `x < 0` side and `v14` cannot move to the `x > 0` side.
           
           My initial calculations suggested solutions, but now it's clear the wall imposes hard constraints.
           
           **Consequences of the Wall**
           
           -   `v12` starts at `x=1.0` and *can't* cross the wall to the objectives `v17` on its left. `v12` is only able to image `v18` on its right side.
           -   `v14` starts at `x=-1.0` and *can't* cross to the objectives `v18` on its right side. `v14` is only able to image `v17` on its left.
           
           Furthermore, the lander `v9` is at `x=-1.9`. This crucial detail reveals a severe problem:
           -   `v12` cannot communicate to the lander. The required communication predicate (comvisible) requires a clear line-of-sight to the lander `v9`, which means a location on the left side of `v19` for the `comvisible` to be true.
           
           Because `v12` is blocked on the positive-x side, and the lander `v9` must be on the negative-x side, this means `v12` cannot send images to the lander (`send_image` action). This is a fatal flaw for achieving the goal, as the mission specifies that *both* rovers must communicate, specifically. And there is a high-level requirement that one of the requirements will be the delivery of `receivedimage(v18)`.
           The goal requires that `v12` sends an image to the lander and, therefore, the goal is unachievable given the constraint the wall poses to these rovers.
