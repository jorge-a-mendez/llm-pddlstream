           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Unachievable Due to Action Restrictions**
           
           Okay, I've got a goal: to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. This essentially means getting images and analyses of certain rocks.  My initial assessment is that this is going to be a tough one.
           
           Let's break it down. I need `receivedimage` predicates for two images, and then `receivedanalysis` predicates for all stones and soils.  To get the images, I would ideally use actions like `take_image` and `send_image`.  To get analyses, I'd need `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`. The definition of the axiom confirms this.  I looked at my initial state and found that all of these conditions were currently false.
           
           Here's the problem: I'm severely restricted in what actions I *can* use. The action instances I'm allowed to use are limited to `move` and `drop_rock`. No `take_image`, no `send_image`, no `sample_rock`, no `send_analysis`.  That's a massive roadblock.
           
           I've examined the effects of each restricted action. Move simply relocates the rover and drop rock changes `full` to `free`. I cannot use `move` or `drop_rock` to generate the necessary predicates.
           
           So, here's my conclusion:  given the extremely limited set of allowed actions, it is *impossible* to achieve the goal. I can't take images, analyze rocks, or send any information.  The goal is unreachable with the current restrictions. The restricted set of actions, that is, the *only* allowed actions, simply don't have the capability to achieve the required predicates.  The goal is effectively a dead end.
