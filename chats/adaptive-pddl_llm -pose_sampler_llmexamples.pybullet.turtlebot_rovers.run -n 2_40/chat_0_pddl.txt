User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a vertical wall in the middle at x = 0. Several small obstacles are scattered throughout the environment, including clusters in the top-left, top-right, and bottom-right corners, and near the center-left. There's also a line of obstacles along y = 1.75 to y = 2.25 at various x positions.
           
           For the target point (1.68 1.48), I will consider positions within a circle of radius 2 centered at this point. I will try to find positions that are not too close to the central wall (x=0) or the bounding walls, and avoid the known small obstacles. Given the target is in the upper right quadrant, I'll prioritize positions in that quadrant, moving away from known obstacles.
           
           Positions:
           (1.0 1.0)
           (2.0 1.0)
           (1.5 0.5)
