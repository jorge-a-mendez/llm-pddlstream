           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.347, 0.45, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.907, 0.42).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.396, 0.401), (-4.297, 0.5)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom type(v12, v17)
           Atom pose(v15, v16)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom type(v8, v17)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v14)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom stackable(v12, v18)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom graspable(v15)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)
           Atom stackable(v15, v10)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom stackable(v8, v18)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of Goal Reachability**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with the goal `new-axiom@0()` which, based on the axioms, translates to achieving `on(?green, v18)` *and* `type(?green, v17)`. The initial state tells me `type(v12, v17)`, so the problem boils down to making `on(v12, v18)` true.  The necessary conditions for `on(?o, ?r)` are `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`.
           
           I quickly identified that `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` is already in the initial state.  Therefore, I need to achieve `atpose(v12, #o2)`. Currently, `atpose(v12, v13)` holds. So, the task is to move `v12` from its current pose `v13` to the desired pose `#o2`.
           
           The initial plan I formulated involved a straightforward *pick* and *place* sequence using the robot's arm, presumably `v4`.
           
           However, here's where the critical constraint comes in: I'm only allowed to use action instances from a provided list.  And that list?  It only contains `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  No `pick` or `place` instances are available.
           
           Since *pick* and *place* are *essential* to manipulate the pose of `v12`—to change it from `v13` to `#o2`—I'm left in an impossible situation.  Without those actions, I can't satisfy the preconditions for `on(v12, v18)`, and consequently, the initial goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable with the given action set.  I've double-checked my reasoning and I'm confident in this conclusion. The lack of `pick` and `place` in the allowed actions is a show-stopper.
