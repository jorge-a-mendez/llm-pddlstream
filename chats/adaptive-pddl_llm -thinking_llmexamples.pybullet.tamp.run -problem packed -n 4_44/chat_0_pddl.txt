           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning: Goal Unreachable**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: getting `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto `v18`. From the initial state, I know they're all currently on `v11`.  My expertise tells me this screams for a classic pick-and-place strategy. I need to get each object, *pick* it up from `v11`, and *place* it onto `v18`.
           
           The initial state provides some crucial information. To achieve the *on* predicate, I'm going to need to look at the supported facts. It indicates where `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` can be placed: `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`, `supported(v14, #o2, v18)`, `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`, `supported(v16, #o2, v18)`. This tells me that they need to be placed at pose `#o2` on `v18`. So I would have preferred to see the pose facts so I could identify each `object` and the `pose`.
           
           I'll check the available actions to form my plan. I see that the only action *instance* is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This moves the robot's base, which doesn't get me any closer to picking up or placing objects.
           
           Let's dive into the core manipulation actions: *pick* and *place*. Looking at the *pick* preconditions, a key one pops out: `kin(?a, ?o, ?p, ?g, ?q, ?t)`. It's relating the arm, object, pose, grasp, base, and arm trajectory. I don't see any `kin` facts in the initial state or in the available actions. Similar thing happens for the `place` action: it is also missing `kin(?a, ?o, ?p, ?g, ?q, ?t)`. That `kin` fact is absolutely critical to even *initiate* a pick or place.
           
           Without `kin` facts, neither *pick* nor *place* can happen.  I've double-checked, and my assumption is correct.  I can't just generate `kin` facts out of thin air.  The lack of these facts is a major problem, as they are crucial for setting the pick and place parameters.
           
           The problem *requires* `pick` and `place` for this goal.  Therefore, I conclude that the goal is currently unreachable with the limited actions provided. I need `kin` facts, or at least `pick` and `place` action instances with some specific objects. As such, I should provide the explanation that because the action instances don't contain any `kin` facts, I am not able to form a plan. This means I can't move the objects!
