           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.178, 0.229), (0.272, 0.323)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.273, -0.5), (-0.182, -0.409)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.092, -0.552), (0.006, -0.455)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.295, -0.108), (-0.21, -0.022)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.122, 0.341), (-0.03, 0.433)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.225, 0.276, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.973, 0.233).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.228, -0.455, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.982, -0.187).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.043, -0.504, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.304, 0.953).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.253, -0.065, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.992, 0.129).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.076, 0.387, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.199, 0.98).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Analysis of a TAMP Problem: Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a planning problem where I need to move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) onto a surface (v20) using a robot with two arms. The robot's base can't move, and the only relevant actions are picking and placing. My initial thought is to make a simple pick-and-place sequence for each object.
           
           The problem, however, is that each object must be "on" v20, which means fully contained within its bounds and stable. I'm given the dimensions of the objects and the surface v20. The key lies in the axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs). I've got a detailed breakdown of each objects dimensions, I see that v20 has a very small area. Now, it seems I need to create unique poses for each item on v20. I also need to satisfy all the problem constraints, namely stable and collision-free object placements. The "tricky detail" is that I need separate pose values for each object, even if they end up sharing the same symbolic pose identifier (#o2).
           
           The constraint: the objects are not only to be placed `on` the surface, they must also be `fully contained` within. I've taken this to mean that the objects are not stacked and have no rotation. Given these rules, there is a fundamental geometrical impossibility. The objects are roughly 0.1m in width each, and the surface v20 is only 0.27m by 0.27m. To fit 5 objects on a 0.27m surface "fully contained" will require their centers to be far enough from each other such that the overall space needed is `0.45`, but I only have `0.27` available. Even if I space them as close as possible without collision, that is not achievable. This makes the goal itself impossible to achieve.
