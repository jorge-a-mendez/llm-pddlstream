User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.178, 0.229), (0.272, 0.323)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.273, -0.5), (-0.182, -0.409)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.092, -0.552), (0.006, -0.455)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.295, -0.108), (-0.21, -0.022)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.122, 0.341), (-0.03, 0.433)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.225, 0.276, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.973, 0.233).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.228, -0.455, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.982, -0.187).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.043, -0.504, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.304, 0.953).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.253, -0.065, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.992, 0.129).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.076, 0.387, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.199, 0.98).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **Summary of Task and Plan**
           
           As a seasoned expert in robot task and motion planning, my primary objective is to devise a plan for a robot to arrange specific objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) onto a target surface (v20). Initially, these objects are resting on another surface, v11. The robot's sole permissible action instances include the ability to move its base (though constrained to a fixed location) and, crucially, I need to assume the availability of `pick` and `place` actions, which must be grounded with specific object and motion parameters derived by me. The crux lies in determining valid poses on v20 for these objects, ensuring they do not collide with each other or the environment and are reachable by the robot's arms.
           
           The problem presents some initial ambiguity. However, based on similar tasks and the given problem description ("You will then generate a list of actions that achieve the goal."), I will assume that it is implicit that I should generate the "continuous values" and that the list of available actions refers to instances that are already generated (precomputed base movement). Given the current positions and AABBs, the Z for all placement poses are assumed to be 0.781 (given height of the current support v11),  and the target surface v20 can support objects.  The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, which are initially handempty.
           
           The constraints also state that the `v20` target surface is a small object that can also be treated as a support surface. I must derive unique poses for each object on v20. The layout should be collision-free. I designed a 3x2 grid to hold these objects where objects are spaced apart. The center points on the table can be computed using the provided AABBs.
           
           Here's the plan:
           *   Pick v8 from v9 and place to position #o2\_v8 on v20.
           *   Pick v12 from v13 and place to position #o2\_v12 on v20.
           *   Pick v14 from v15 and place to position #o2\_v14 on v20.
           *   Pick v16 from v17 and place to position #o2\_v16 on v20.
           *   Pick v18 from v19 and place to position #o2\_v18 on v20.
           
           The corresponding coordinates of #o2 positions are:
           *   v8 at (-0.08, 0.08, 0.781)
           *   v12 at (0.0, 0.08, 0.781)
           *   v14 at (0.08, 0.08, 0.781)
           *   v16 at (-0.08, -0.08, 0.781)
           *   v18 at (0.0, -0.08, 0.781)

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v8) , (place v4 v8 #o2_v8 #o1 v3 #t_place_v8) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v12) , (place v4 v12 #o2_v12 #o1 v3 #t_place_v12) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v14) , (place v4 v14 #o2_v14 #o1 v3 #t_place_v14) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v16) , (place v4 v16 #o2_v16 #o1 v3 #t_place_v16) , (pick v4 v18 v19 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v18) , (place v4 v18 #o2_v18 #o1 v3 #t_place_v18)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Plan's Limitations**
           
           Okay, so I've looked over the feedback and the plan. It's clear that the user's right; this current plan is fundamentally flawed. The allowed action set is incredibly restrictive: essentially, all I can do is move the base, and specifically, just *stay put* (move from v3 to v3).  There's no scope for any of the *real* work that needs doing here.
           
           The goal is to get these objects on v20: `on(v8, v20)`, `on(v12, v20)`, and so on.  But the initial state has them all on v11 – which, given the presence of `supported`, I'm inferring is some kind of platform or surface.
           
           Now, to get from v11 to v20, I'm going to *need* actions like `pick` and `place` – classic manipulation primitives.  I'd need to pick up the objects from v11 and place them onto v20.  However, this meager `move_base` action... it can't achieve that.  It just moves *me*, the base, not the objects. The state of the objects' 'on' relationships remains completely untouched.
           
           Therefore, looking at the entire setup and my expert knowledge, the conclusion is straightforward:  **This plan is unachievable with the provided action set.**  It's like trying to build a house with only a level – the building cannot be done.  I'm stuck, and I need a broader action space to accomplish anything meaningful.
