(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation Strategy for a Square Object**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is to find 50 stable placements for an object (ID 4) with dimensions nearly square (0.0727366557962722, 0.0727366557962722), let's call it `s`, on surface 0, a square AABB defined by ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).  A stable placement means the object is *fully* inside the surface's boundaries, regardless of its rotation.
           
           First, I realized that because the object is *almost* square, its bounding box size changes very predictably with rotation. The dimensions of the rotated object's bounding box are `rotated_w = rotated_h = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This means the *maximum* possible rotated dimension of the object occurs at a 45-degree angle. That's the key to ensuring *all* placements work. I calculated this *maximum* rotated size, using `max_side = s * sqrt(2) = 0.10285`.  This, in turn, allowed me to calculate a *safe* placement range. To ensure that regardless of the theta, the object can always fit.
           
           Now, I'll calculate the safest valid placement range. For the object to be fully contained, its center (x, y) must stay within:  `x_min_valid = -0.083575`, `x_max_valid = 0.083575`, `y_min_valid = -0.083575`, `y_max_valid = 0.083575`.
           
           I am using `x_coords = [-0.083575, -0.0417875, 0.0, 0.0417875, 0.083575]` and `y_coords = [-0.083575, -0.0417875, 0.0, 0.0417875, 0.083575]`
           
           By creating a 5x5 grid of (x, y) coordinates within this safe range, and then combining them with different rotation angles, I can guarantee stable placements. I selected a few thetas, and in total, I get 50 different positions.
           
           Placements are:
               Loop through two thetas (0 and pi/4), and loop through x and y coords
               (0, 0.0, -0.083575, -0.083575)
               (0, 0.0, -0.0417875, -0.083575)
               (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.083575)
               ...
               (0, 0.0, 0.083575, 0.083575) - this is the 25th placement.
               (0, 0.7853981633974483, -0.083575, -0.083575) (note: pi/4 = 0.7853981633974483)
               (0, 0.7853981633974483, -0.0417875, -0.083575)
               ...
               (0, 0.7853981633974483, 0.083575, 0.083575) - this is the 50th placement.
           
           This method guarantees stability and diverse placement, meeting all requirements.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Object Placement and Collision Avoidance**
           
           I'm tasked with finding stable placements for a new object (ID 5) on surface 0, avoiding collision with a previously placed object (ID 4). Object 5 is a square with side `s = 0.0983093`.  I know object 4's position and size.  My initial surface range calculations are correct: object 5 must stay within the surface boundaries.  To handle rotation, I calculate the maximum AABB dimension for object 5. My logic regarding the calculation of the AABB for a rotated square is sound: I'm using the diagonal of the square to determine the AABB's dimensions when rotated by `pi/4`.
           
           I've correctly defined the AABB of object 4. I need to generate placement coordinates for object 5. My plan is to use a grid of potential center points for object 5, along with two rotations (0 and pi/4), and check each configuration for collision with object 4.  My method for detecting collision between the AABB of object 4 and object 5 is correct. I have a `check_collision` function.  I am correctly checking the overlap in both x and y.
           
           I initially used a 5x5 grid, but I found that with that grid size, the total potential placements were not enough. I calculated the number of safe placements for both rotations. Using a 5x5 grid, and the current strategy, I can only generate 32 collision-free placements, not enough for the 50 I need. I'm now testing a 7x7 grid, and the calculations are correct: the number of collision-free placements is 57 now, enough for the 50 placements.  I have enough collision-free configurations now.

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning for Finding 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to place 50 stable instances of object 6 (a square) on surface 0, avoiding collisions with the existing objects 4 and 5. This is a classic packing problem, and I'll use a brute-force search with optimization.
           
           **1. Define the Problem:**
           
           *   **Object 6:** A square with side length s\_6 = 0.0773, on surface 0.
           *   **Surface 0:**  A rectangular surface centered at (0,0) with dimensions (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           *   **Existing Objects:** Object 4 (a square) placed at (-0.083575, -0.083575), and object 5 (a square) at (-0.065484, 0.021828). I need to avoid overlap with their placements.
           *   **Rotations:** I'll consider 4 rotations: 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees.
           
           **2.  Calculate the Safe Region:**
           
           *   Since object 6 can rotate, I need to account for its worst-case size when rotated.  The AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) around the square will be largest at 45 degrees where its diagonals are most extended. The bounding boxes for an AABB for a rotated square are calculated.
           *   The valid placement region is calculated: x and y coordinates that account for objects 4 and 5 presence
           *   I'll generate a grid of candidate placements within this region.
           
           **3. Generate Candidate Placements:**
           
           *   A 10x10 grid of (x, y) coordinates with a good step (10 points). 
           *   I'll test each grid point with 4 possible orientations
           
           **4. Check for Collisions (Overlap):**
           
           *   For each candidate placement, I'll calculate its AABB (which can change for each rotation).  Using rotated corner coordinates.
           *   I will test this AABB against the pre-computed AABBs for objects 4 and 5.
           *   If there's no overlap (no "collision"), the placement is valid.
           
           **5. Iterate and Optimize:**
           
           *   After the iteration is done, I can see how many I find, I can refine with further analysis on areas that are packed well.
           *   After the code is running, I'm able to find enough placements (a 10x10 grid) to reach the 50 I need.
