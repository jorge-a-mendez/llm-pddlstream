(Thoughts: **Revised Plan to Achieve new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, I've got this. The goal `new-axiom@0()` is a bit of a mixed bag, but I think I've figured out how to achieve it. Basically, I need to get images of four objectives, analyze two rocks (one of each type), and send the results back to the lander. Here's my plan:
           
           **Background:**
           
           *   I'm dealing with two rovers (`v12` and `v14`), a lander (`v9`), a camera (`v10`), and a bunch of rocks.
           *   The initial state is pretty straightforward: both rovers are at specific configurations (`v13` and `v15`), have free storage space (`v16`), and have line-of-sight to the lander.
           *   I also see that various image-taking and analysis capabilities are possible.
           
           **Key Challenges:**
           
           The tricky part is these "continuous parameters" that are referenced in the problem's initial state. Objects that begin with `#` (like `#o3`) are supposed to be trajectories or poses that have not been computed, but given the structure of the problem and the allowed actions (which are no-ops) it would appear these are fixed.
           
           *   `imagevisible` and `comvisible`: These predicates link the rovers to specific objectives and the lander.  The presence of these facts in the initial state *imply* I can perform these actions from *my* current location (v13 or v15). I need to make the assumption that the continuous configuration values are effectively the same as the current locations.
           
           **Actions (using rover `v14` for all tasks)**
           Here's the plan, step-by-step. I'll focus on rover `v14` as the actions are easier:
           First, rover `v14` (at configuration `v15`):
           *   Take Images
               1.  Calibrate the camera: `calibrate(v14, v15, #o4, v17, v10)`.  I'm using the #oX variables *as is*.
               2.  Take the image of objective `v17`: `take_image(v14, v15, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`.
               3.  Send the image: `send_image(v14, v15, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`.
               4.  Repeat steps 1-3 for objectives `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`.
           
           *   Analysis and Transmission:
               5.  Sample rock v3: `sample_rock(v14, v15, v3, v16)`. *Assuming v3 is a rock of type v2*.
               6.  Send analysis of v3: `send_analysis(v14, v15, #o1, v9, v3)`.
               7.  Drop the rock (free up v16): `drop_rock(v14, v16)`.
               8.  Sample rock v5: `sample_rock(v14, v15, v5, v16)`. *Assuming v5 is a rock of type v6*.
               9.  Send analysis of v5: `send_analysis(v14, v15, #o1, v9, v5)`.
               0.  Drop the rock (to free up v16): `drop_rock(v14, v16)`.
           
           **Outcome**
           
           Assuming my interpretation about using the continuous parameters holds, this plan should achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This should make all of the necessary predicates evaluate to `True`.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Unattainable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've completely messed up. The user was right; my previous plan is useless because I totally ignored the constraints! I need to be *much* more careful. This provided list of valid actions is incredibly restrictive: essentially, all I can do is move rovers to the same location or drop rocks if they're full.
           
           Let's break down the goal `new-axiom@0()` with this new, extremely limited perspective. First, I have to ensure `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are true. Thankfully, those are already true in the initial state and are never altered by the available `move` actions. Excellent.
           
           Next, I need `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`. Great, those are also true initially. The `drop_rock` actions could *restore* these states, but only after a rock is "full".
           
           Unfortunately, the goal includes achieving several predicates involving received images and received analyses. I need to achieve: `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedimage(v20, v11)`, as well as `type(?stone, v2)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, and `type(?soil, v6)`, `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           This is where the problem becomes glaring. I don't have *any* `send_image` or `send_analysis` actions available! These actions are essential for communicating data and analysis. They simply don't exist in my action space.
           
           Even if I could somehow get a store "full" to drop a rock, it does absolutely nothing to get me closer to any of the *received* predicates. No matter how many times I move to a spot, I can't communicate or analyze.
           
           **Conclusion:** The goal is completely unreachable with these constraints. I need a drastic rethink or to understand the broader context. Maybe I'm missing some crucial setup information.
