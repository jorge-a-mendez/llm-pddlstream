           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           My objective is to achieve the goal of `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  This necessitates that objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` be placed on `v16` (meaning they need to be at pose `#o2` and supported by `v16`). To accomplish this, I must manipulate the objects' `atpose` states.
           
           The established method for achieving `on` predicates is as follows: `on(?o, ?r)` is true if `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)` are simultaneously true. Initially, objects are supported by `v11`. Placing them on `v16` entails changing their `atpose` from the initial poses (`v9`, `v13`, `v15`) to a pose on `v16`.
           
           The logical approach involves using `pick` and `place` actions. However, a significant constraint is imposed: I am limited to using only the action instances explicitly given in the "list of valid action instances." The given list is merely `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This means the only permitted action instance is `move_base`, and no `pick` or `place` instances are in the list.
           
           Since the problem's constraints necessitate using ONLY the action instances provided, and no `pick` or `place` action instances are given, the fundamental prerequisite actions for altering the `atpose` states are unavailable. Thus, I am incapable of manipulating the objects into the desired state on `v16`. Therefore, it's impossible to achieve the target conditions, and I must conclude the goal is infeasible with the provided action instances.
