           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Goal and Available Actions**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all `on(v16)`.  That means they need to be supported by `v16` and at their designated poses on `v16`.  Looking at the initial state, each object (`v8`, `v12`, and `v14`) is currently supported by `v11` at their respective poses (`v9`, `v13`, and `v15`).  Specifically, we have facts like `supported(v8, v9, v11)` and `atpose(v8, v9)`. To get them onto `v16`, we need to change their `atpose` such that they are `atpose(#o2)` on `v16`, where `#o2` is a pose supported by `v16`.
           
           The actions I'm given are limited: `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`. However, the *only* action instance provided is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  `move_base` doesn't affect object placement. It just moves the robot's base.  The other actions (`pick` and `place`) are the ones I'd expect to see, but they're not there.  `move_base` has the peculiar effect of setting `NegatedAtom canmove()`, but the other actions reset it.
           
           The crux of the problem is that to change the `atpose` of an object, I'd *need* to use a `pick` and `place` sequence.  I need to `pick` an object to remove it from `v11` and then `place` it onto `v16`.  However, no such action instances are provided.
           
           **The Inherent Impossibility**
           
           Considering the available information, achieving the goal is impossible. I can't manipulate the `atpose` of any objects because I don't have the `pick` and `place` actions, and the `move_base` action is irrelevant to this kind of object manipulation. The goal requires an action that's simply not present in the allowed action instances list. The state is such that objects are supported by v11, but the only goal-relevant supported facts are where they should go on v16. No path exists.
