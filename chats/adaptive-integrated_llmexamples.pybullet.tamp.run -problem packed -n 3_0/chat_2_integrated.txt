User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.078, 0.226), (0.169, 0.317)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.023, -0.562), (0.107, -0.478)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.124, 0.271, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.195, 0.981).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.224, -0.344), (-0.125, -0.245)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.065, -0.52, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.78, 0.625).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.175, -0.294, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.93, -0.367).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes three objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, and two arms, `v4` and `v6`. There are also three surfaces: `v10`, `v11`, and `v16`.
           
           The initial state places `v8` on `v11` at `v9`, `v14` on `v11` at `v15`, and `v12` on `v11` at `v13`. All objects are graspable. Arm `v4` is at `v5` and `v6` is at `v7`, and both are handempty. The robot's base is at `v3`.
           
           The goal is to place all three objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`) on the `v16` surface.
           
           The plan will involve picking up each object from its current location and placing it on `v16` at a new pose represented by `#o2`. The robot arm `v4` will be used for all pick and place operations, and the base will remain at `v3` for all operations.
           
           Since the goal is to place objects on `v16`, and we have `#o2` as a possible pose on `v16`, we should use this for placing objects.
           We need to make sure that for each placement, the pose is collision-free and within the bounds of `v16`.
           
           First, `v8` is picked from `v9` and placed on `v16` at `#o2`.
           Second, `v12` is picked from `v13` and placed on `v16` at a new `#o2`.
           Third, `v14` is picked from `v15` and placed on `v16` at a new `#o2`.

           Since the goal is to place objects on `v16`, and we have `#o2` as a possible pose on `v16`, we should use this for placing objects.
           We need to make sure that for each placement, the pose is collision-free and within the bounds of `v16`.
           
           Let's consider the AABB of `v16` which is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           For `v8`, its AABB is `((0.078, 0.226), (0.169, 0.317))`.
           For `v12`, its AABB is `((-0.224, -0.344), (-0.125, -0.245))`.
           For `v14`, its AABB is `((0.023, -0.562), (0.107, -0.478))`.
           
           Since the previous poses for `v12` and `v14` were not stable, I will try to place them closer to the center of `v16`. Also, the AABBs for `v8`, `v12`, `v14` are given as relative to their own object frame. When placing them on `v16`, we need to find poses such that their global AABB (after applying the pose) is contained within `v16`'s AABB. Given the AABBs of the objects are larger than the surface itself, it is impossible to place them within the bounds. Let's re-examine the AABB definitions. It looks like the AABBs provided are for the _objects themselves_, and not necessarily what they *project* to on the surface. For objects with small dimensions (like plates), a simple projection to (x,y) of the given pose will mostly work. Let's assume the given AABBs are about the object's relative coordinates. I will try to center the objects on `v16`.
           
           Let's assume the provided AABBs are for the *object's extent* and not a placement constraint. The previous attempt with `0.0 0.1` and `0.0 -0.1` suggests the object's width/length causes it to go out of bounds. Let's try to place them all at the same central `x,y` coordinates.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', v30) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The previous plan failed because `atbconf` was not satisfied. This indicates that the base configuration `v30` used in the `kin` predicates (which were used for `pick` and `place` actions) was not the current base configuration `v3`. The initial state clearly shows `atbconf(v3)`. The `kin` predicates provided in the initial state, such as `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`, use `#o3` as the base configuration. Therefore, we need to move the base from `v3` to `#o3` before any pick or place operation. Also, we will need to compute a value for `#o3`.
           
           The scene describes three objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, and two arms, `v4` and `v6`. There are also three surfaces: `v10`, `v11`, and `v16`.
           
           The initial state places `v8` on `v11` at `v9`, `v14` on `v11` at `v15`, and `v12` on `v11` at `v13`. All objects are graspable. Arm `v4` is at `v5` and `v6` is at `v7`, and both are handempty. The robot's base is at `v3`.
           
           The goal is to place all three objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`) on the `v16` surface.
           
           The plan will involve moving the base to a suitable configuration for manipulation, picking up each object from its current location, and placing it on `v16` at a new pose represented by `#o2`. The robot arm `v4` will be used for all pick and place operations.
           
           Let's use the object `v3` as the base configuration if possible, otherwise we will need to move to `#o3`. The `kin` predicates provided in the initial state are like `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` and `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`, where `#o3` is the base configuration. This implies that the pick and place operations require the robot to be at base configuration `#o3`. So, we will need to move the base from `v3` to `#o3` first.
           
           For the poses of the objects on `v16`, I will try to place them at slightly different `x` coordinates to avoid overlaps and stay within the bounds of `v16` (AABB = `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`). The AABB of objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14` are quite large, meaning these objects may represent larger items that can be placed on `v16` if centered or slightly offset. I will use (0.0, 0.0) as the center for `v8`, and then offset for the others.
