User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           #o2: object
           v10: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.175, -0.294, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.93, -0.367).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.124, 0.271, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.195, 0.981).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.224, -0.344), (-0.125, -0.245)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.078, 0.226), (0.169, 0.317)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.065, -0.52, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.78, 0.625).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.023, -0.562), (0.107, -0.478)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom atpose(v14, v15)
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom supported(v14, v15, v11)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom stackable(v14, v16)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom stackable(v14, v10)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes three objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, and two arms: `v4` and `v6`. Each object has a current pose on `v11` and also a potential pose `#o2` on `v10` or `v16`. The goal is to place all three objects on `v16`. Since there are no pick or place actions listed in the available action instances, and the `move_base` action does not affect the state of `on` predicates, the goal is unreachable. This is because the `on` predicate depends on `supported` and `atpose`, and the initial state already specifies poses for `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` on `v11`. To achieve the goal, these objects would need to be moved to `v16`, which requires pick and place actions, but these actions are not available.
