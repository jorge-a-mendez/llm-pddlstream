           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is constrained by a square perimeter defined by AABBs 1, 2, 3, 4, with corners at approximately (-2.5, -2.5) and (2.5, 2.5). There's also a vertical wall (AABB 5) along x=0. Other AABBs represent smaller obstacles.
           
           Given the target point (1.78, 0.42), I need to find positions within a radius of 2 from it. This means the x-coordinates should be in the range [1.78 - 2, 1.78 + 2] = [-0.22, 3.78] and y-coordinates in the range [0.42 - 2, 0.42 + 2] = [-1.58, 2.42]. Considering the overall scene limits, the x range is [-0.22, 2.5] and the y range is [-1.58, 2.42].
           
           I will try to place the robot in different directions around the target point, keeping in mind the large obstacle at x=0 (AABB 5), which will block line-of-sight if the robot is on one side and the target on the other. Since the target is at x=1.78, I should stay on the positive x side of the large wall, so x > 0.05.
           
           The first position will be directly to the right of the target, close to the edge of the allowed x range, but also within the overall scene limits and within max_range of the target. This would be (1.78 + 2*cos(0), 0.42 + 2*sin(0)) = (3.78, 0.42). However, this exceeds the x limit of 2.5, so I will try (2.4, 0.42). This is a distance of sqrt((2.4-1.78)^2 + (0.42-0.42)^2) = 0.62, which is less than 2.
           
           The second position will be above the target, still within the positive x-plane. I will try a position like (1.78, 0.42 + 1.5) = (1.78, 1.92). This is well within the max_range and general limits.
           
           The third position will be below the target, also in the positive x-plane. I'll try (1.78, 0.42 - 1.5) = (1.78, -1.08). This is also well within the max_range and general limits.
           
           All three proposed points are to the right of the central wall (AABB 5), which is from x=-0.05 to x=0.05. None of these positions appear to overlap with the listed AABBs based on a quick visual inspection. For example, AABB 13 is ((2.109, 1.072), (2.220, 1.183)), which none of my chosen points fall inside. AABB 16 is ((1.838, -1.978), (1.963, -1.853)), also not overlapping.
           Positions:
           (2.4 0.42)
           (1.78 1.92)
           (1.78 -1.08)

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point is now (-1.82, 1.84). The previous attempt failed because I misunderstood the target point and assumed it was (1.78, 0.42). I apologize for that error. I will use the *correct* target point (-1.82, 1.84) for this request.
           
           The maximum range from the target is 2. This means the x-coordinates should be in the range [-1.82 - 2, -1.82 + 2] = [-3.82, 0.18] and y-coordinates in the range [1.84 - 2, 1.84 + 2] = [-0.16, 3.84]. Considering the overall scene limits, the x range is [-2.5, 0.18] and the y range is [-0.16, 2.5].
           
           The previous positions (2.4, 0.42), (1.78, 1.92), and (1.78, -1.08) are all invalid for the new target point (-1.82, 1.84) and were indeed on the wrong side of the x=0 barrier (AABB 5).
           
           Let's re-evaluate based on the correct target and the collision/no-line-of-sight feedback:
           - (2.4, 0.42) collided with AABB 3 ((2.45, -2.55), (2.55, 2.55)). This is expected as 2.4 is very close to the x=2.5 boundary.
           - (1.78, 1.92) collided with AABB 7 ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)). This is also expected as 1.78 and 1.92 are inside this box.
           - (1.78, -1.08) had no line of sight, likely due to the AABB 5 (x=0 wall) being between it and the target.
           
           Now, with the correct target at (-1.82, 1.84), I need to find positions within the valid x range of [-2.5, 0.18] and y range of [-0.16, 2.5]. I must avoid the x=0 barrier (AABB 5), and also consider the various small obstacles in the scene. Since the target is at x=-1.82, I should stay on the negative x side of AABB 5, so x < -0.05.
           
           Let's try to place the robot in different directions around the target point, keeping in mind the obstacles.
           
           1.  **To the left of the target:** A position further left from the target. Let's try (-1.82 - 1.5, 1.84) = (-3.32, 1.84). This exceeds the x limit of -2.5. So, I will try a position at the x limit: (-2.4, 1.84). This is within the max_range (sqrt((-2.4 - (-1.82))^2 + (1.84 - 1.84)^2) = 0.58 < 2). This position seems free, but is close to AABB 4 (the left wall).
           
           2.  **Below the target:** A position directly below the target. Let's try (-1.82, 1.84 - 1.5) = (-1.82, 0.34). This is within the valid range and seems to avoid major obstacles.
           
           3.  **To the right of the target, but still on the negative x side:** A position slightly to the right of the target. This needs to be carefully chosen to avoid AABB 5. Let's try (-1.82 + 0.5, 1.84) = (-1.32, 1.84). This position is within the valid x range (which ends at 0.18) and far enough from the x=0 wall. I will check for smaller obstacles: AABB 15 is ((-1.19, 2.03), (-1.09, 2.14)), AABB 17 is ((-0.89, 1.66), (-0.78, 1.77)), AABB 19 is ((-0.56, 1.78), (-0.47, 1.87)). My point (-1.32, 1.84) seems clear of these. AABB 6 is ((-2.4047, -2.3455), (-1.3952, -1.6544)), which is not relevant here. AABB 8 is ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)), this is close to the target itself. My position (-1.32, 1.84) is outside this AABB 8, as -1.32 > -1.75.
           Positions:
           (-2.4 1.84)
           (-1.82 0.34)
           (-1.32 1.84)

Model:     The target point remains (-1.82, 1.84). I've received feedback on the previous attempts:
           - Positions (2.4, 0.42), (1.78, 1.92), (1.78, -1.08) were from my initial mistake with the target point and are irrelevant for the current target.
           - For the correct target (-1.82, 1.84):
               - (-2.4, 1.84) collided with AABB 4 (the left wall: ((-2.55, -2.55), (-2.45, 2.55))) and AABB 8 ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)). My x-coordinate -2.4 is within the x-range of AABB 4 (-2.55 to -2.45) and AABB 8 (-2.25 to -1.75). The y-coordinate 1.84 is within the y-range of AABB 4 (-2.55 to 2.55) and AABB 8 (1.75 to 2.25). This was an oversight on my part, putting it too close to the wall and too close to another obstacle.
           
           My current valid search space for (x, y) is approximately x: [-2.5, 0.18] and y: [-0.16, 2.5]. I need to ensure x < -0.05 to avoid AABB 5.
           
           Let's refine the strategy, being more careful about the fixed obstacles.
           The target is at (-1.82, 1.84). AABB 8 ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)) is a significant obstacle around the target. This means any point with x between -2.25 and -1.75 and y between 1.75 and 2.25 is likely to collide or be too close to this obstacle.
           
           1.  **Re-evaluating "Below the target":** My previous suggestion was (-1.82, 0.34).
               - x = -1.82: This is within AABB 8's x-range.
               - y = 0.34: This is *not* within AABB 8's y-range (1.75 to 2.25). So this point should avoid AABB 8.
               - Check other obstacles around (-1.82, 0.34):
                   - AABB 6 ((-2.4047, -2.3455), (-1.3952, -1.6544)) is far below.
                   - AABB 12 ((-1.3467, 0.0418), (-1.2061, 0.1824)) is to the right and slightly below.
               - This position still seems promising. The distance is sqrt((-1.82 - (-1.82))^2 + (0.34 - 1.84)^2) = 1.5, which is < 2.
           
           2.  **Re-evaluating "To the right of the target, but still negative x":** My previous suggestion was (-1.32, 1.84).
               - x = -1.32: This is outside AABB 8's x-range (-2.25 to -1.75), so it should be fine regarding AABB 8.
               - y = 1.84: This is within AABB 8's y-range.
               - Check other obstacles:
                   - AABB 15 ((-1.196, 2.039), (-1.095, 2.140)): My point (-1.32, 1.84) is to the left and below this.
                   - AABB 17 ((-0.897, 1.664), (-0.787, 1.774)): My point (-1.32, 1.84) is to the left and above this.
                   - AABB 19 ((-0.560, 1.785), (-0.475, 1.870)): My point (-1.32, 1.84) is to the left of this.
               - This position still looks good. The distance is sqrt((-1.32 - (-1.82))^2 + (1.84 - 1.84)^2) = 0.5, which is < 2.
           
           3.  **A new position: "Above the target, but avoiding AABB 8":**
               - To avoid AABB 8 (y-range 1.75 to 2.25), I need a y value outside this range. Let's go significantly above.
               - Target y is 1.84. A point at y = 2.4 would be above AABB 8 (since AABB 8's max y is 2.25).
               - Let's try (-1.82, 2.4).
               - x = -1.82: within AABB 8's x-range, but y = 2.4 is outside.
               - Check other obstacles:
                   - AABB 15 ((-1.19, 2.03), (-1.09, 2.14)): My point (-1.82, 2.4) is to the left and above this.
                   - AABB 20 ((-1.86, 1.80), (-1.77, 1.89)): This is effectively part of AABB 8, so my point at y=2.4 is above this.
                   - AABB 9 and 10 are to the right of the x=0 axis.
               - The distance is sqrt((-1.82 - (-1.82))^2 + (2.4 - 1.84)^2) = 0.56, which is < 2. This seems like a good candidate.
           
           I must be careful about the boundaries. For (-2.4, 1.84) failing due to AABB 4 ((-2.55, -2.55), (-2.45, 2.55)), it means that x=-2.4 is already too far left. This suggests I need to stay further to the right of the absolute x=-2.5 boundary.
           
           Let's reconfirm the valid x-range. Max range from target is 2. Target x = -1.82.
           So, valid x is [-1.82-2, -1.82+2] = [-3.82, 0.18].
           Robot's x-limit is [-2.5, 2.5].
           So, the intersection is [-2.5, 0.18].
           However, AABB 4 is from x=-2.55 to -2.45. So I should probably aim for x > -2.45 to avoid that wall.
           And AABB 5 is from x=-0.05 to 0.05. So I should aim for x < -0.05.
           Thus, the actual valid x-range from obstacles is roughly [-2.45, -0.05].
           
           My proposed points will be checked against this refined understanding.
           1.  **(-1.82, 0.34):** x=-1.82 (within [-2.45, -0.05]), y=0.34 (within [-0.16, 2.5]). Seems valid.
           2.  **(-1.32, 1.84):** x=-1.32 (within [-2.45, -0.05]), y=1.84 (within [-0.16, 2.5]). Seems valid.
           3.  **(-1.82, 2.4):** x=-1.82 (within [-2.45, -0.05]), y=2.4 (within [-0.16, 2.5]). Seems valid.
           
           All these positions are well within the max_range of 2 from the target and avoid the large obstacles based on the refined ranges. I'm being careful to avoid AABB 8 (near the target) and AABB 4 (left wall).
           Positions:
           (-1.82 0.34)

           The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point has changed *again* to (-0.51, 1.82)! I need to pay close attention to the target point in each request. My previous reasoning was for target (-1.82, 1.84). The feedback received is for the *new* target point (-0.51, 1.82).
           
           Let's break down the feedback for target (-0.51, 1.82):
           - (-1.82, 0.34) -- no line of sight to target. This is plausible as the x=0 wall (AABB 5) might be in the way, or other obstacles, as this point is quite far from the target. The target is at x=-0.51, the robot at x=-1.82.
           - (-1.32, 1.84) -- not reachable for robot base. This means it's outside the max_range of 2 from the target (-0.51, 1.82). Let's check: distance = sqrt((-1.32 - (-0.51))^2 + (1.84 - 1.82)^2) = sqrt((-0.81)^2 + (0.02)^2) = sqrt(0.6561 + 0.0004) = sqrt(0.6565) approx 0.81. This *is* reachable. The error message "not reachable" might refer to collision or being outside scene limits, or a non-fixed obstacle. Since it wasn't a collision with a *fixed* obstacle, I should assume it was a non-fixed obstacle or some other internal system error.
           - (-1.82, 2.4) -- collides with AABB 1 ((-2.55, 2.45), (2.55, 2.55)) and AABB 8 ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)).
               - AABB 1 is the top wall. My y=2.4 is within the y-range of AABB 1 (2.45 to 2.55). This means I am too close to the top boundary.
               - AABB 8 is ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)). My x=-1.82 is within this x-range. My y=2.4 is outside the y-range, but it's very close to AABB 1. It seems the primary collision was with AABB 1, and AABB 8 was perhaps a secondary check or a misattribution.
           
           Now, for the *correct* target point (-0.51, 1.82).
           The max range of 2 from the target means:
           x range: [-0.51 - 2, -0.51 + 2] = [-2.51, 1.49]. Intersecting with robot limits [-2.5, 2.5], this gives [-2.5, 1.49].
           y range: [1.82 - 2, 1.82 + 2] = [-0.18, 3.82]. Intersecting with robot limits [-2.5, 2.5], this gives [-0.18, 2.5].
           
           I still need to avoid AABB 5 (the x=0 wall). Since the target is at x=-0.51, I should generally stay to the left of the x=0 wall, so x < -0.05. This also means x values like 1.49 are technically possible (right of the wall), but would lead to no line of sight. So, the effective x range is [-2.5, -0.05].
           
           Let's generate new points, being very careful with the obstacles.
           The target is at (-0.51, 1.82).
           
           Obstacles to consider:
           - AABB 1 ((-2.55, 2.45), (2.55, 2.55)): Top wall. Avoid y > 2.45.
           - AABB 5 ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)): Central vertical wall. Stay at x < -0.05.
           - AABB 8 ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)): A block to the far left of the target.
           - AABB 10 ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)): This is very close to the target! Target x = -0.51 is between -0.75 and -0.25. Target y = 1.82 is between 1.75 and 2.25. So the target is *inside* AABB 10. This is an important piece of information. This means that to view the target, the robot needs to be able to see *into* AABB 10, or around it. If AABB 10 is an actual solid block, then placing the robot at the target's coordinates would collide. The prompt says "view a target object", so the target point itself is probably a feature on or within an object described by AABB 10. The robot should not be inside AABB 10, but rather outside it, with a line of sight.
           
           Given the target is effectively "inside" AABB 10, I should place the robot *around* AABB 10.
           AABB 10 is from x: -0.75 to -0.25, y: 1.75 to 2.25.
           
           1.  **To the left of AABB 10:**
               - I need x < -0.75. Let's try x = -1.0. This is within range [-2.5, -0.05].
               - Y can be around the target's y. Let's try y = 1.82.
               - Point: (-1.0, 1.82).
               - Distance from target (-0.51, 1.82): sqrt((-1.0 - (-0.51))^2 + (1.82 - 1.82)^2) = 0.49. This is < 2.
               - Check for other obstacles:
                   - AABB 8 ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)): (-1.0, 1.82) is to the right of this.
                   - AABB 15 ((-1.19, 2.03), (-1.09, 2.14)): (-1.0, 1.82) is to the right and below this.
               - This seems like a good position.
           
           2.  **Below AABB 10:**
               - I need y < 1.75. Let's try y = 1.0.
               - X can be around the target's x. Let's try x = -0.51.
               - Point: (-0.51, 1.0).
               - Distance from target (-0.51, 1.82): sqrt((-0.51 - (-0.51))^2 + (1.0 - 1.82)^2) = 0.82. This is < 2.
               - Check for other obstacles:
                   - AABB 14 ((-0.28, 0.58), (-0.13, 0.73)): (-0.51, 1.0) is to the left and above this.
                   - AABB 12 ((-1.34, 0.04), (-1.20, 0.18)): Far to the left.
               - This seems like a good position.
           
           3.  **Above AABB 10:**
               - I need y > 2.25. Let's try y = 2.35. (Need to be careful to avoid top wall AABB 1 at y=2.45).
               - X can be around the target's x. Let's try x = -0.51.
               - Point: (-0.51, 2.35).
               - Distance from target (-0.51, 1.82): sqrt((-0.51 - (-0.51))^2 + (2.35 - 1.82)^2) = 0.53. This is < 2.
               - Check for other obstacles:
                   - AABB 1 (top wall): My y=2.35 is below 2.45, so should be fine.
                   - AABB 9 ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)) and AABB 21 ((0.45, 1.92), (0.54, 2.01)) are on the other side of x=0.
               - This also seems like a good position.
           
           I should also consider the feedback for (-1.32, 1.84) being "not reachable". This is surprising given the distance calculation. It might be due to an implied non-fixed obstacle, or a very tight path. Since I am given to understand that I "never give up", I will try to use this point again as it looks geometrically sound, but I will provide two other more "safe" positions. Since I have to provide 3 positions, I will try to re-use one of the previous positions that was "reachable" according to my calculation, assuming the error might have been related to something else. However, for a target within AABB 10, the "not reachable" error might indicate collision with AABB 10 itself. I should avoid placing the robot *inside* any of the obstacles. My point (-1.32, 1.84) is outside AABB 10, so it shouldn't collide.
           
           Let's stick to the 3 new positions derived from reasoning around AABB 10:
           Positions:
           (-1.0 1.82)
           (-0.51 1.0)
           (-0.51 2.35)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point is still (-0.51, 1.82). I will focus on the new feedback for this target.
           
           Previously, I identified AABB 10 ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)) as containing the target. I tried to place the robot around this obstacle.
           Here's the feedback on my last three proposals for target (-0.51, 1.82):
           - (-1.0, 1.82) -- collided with AABB 17 ((-0.897, 1.664), (-0.787, 1.774)). My x-coordinate -1.0 is less than -0.897, but my y-coordinate 1.82 is greater than 1.774. This indicates I was trying to place the robot in a region between AABB 10 and AABB 17, and it hit AABB 17, which is directly to the left and slightly below the target. It seems I misjudged the x-coordinate of -1.0 being clear of -0.897, but it's on the left side, so collision is possible depending on the exact dimensions. The collision makes sense given (-1.0, 1.82) is close to the x-range of AABB 17.
           
           - (-0.51, 1.0) -- No feedback provided, meaning this position was accepted. This is good news, and I should remember this. (Wait, I should re-read. The format is a list of failures. So if it's not listed, it means it *was* valid in the last attempt.) This suggests that the position (-0.51, 1.0) is a valid one. I will provide it again since it worked.
           
           - (-0.51, 2.35) -- No feedback provided, meaning this position was accepted. This also means it was a valid position. I will provide it again.
           
           So, for this request, I already have two confirmed valid positions: (-0.51, 1.0) and (-0.51, 2.35). I need to find one more valid position.
           
           Recap of the environment and target (-0.51, 1.82):
           - Valid x range for robot: [-2.5, -0.05] (to avoid x=0 wall and stay on target side).
           - Valid y range for robot: [-0.18, 2.45] (to avoid top wall, and be within max range).
           - Target is "within" AABB 10 ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)).
           - Failed (-1.0, 1.82) collided with AABB 17 ((-0.897, 1.664), (-0.787, 1.774)). This means the area directly to the left of AABB 10 is also blocked by AABB 17. So, for x < -0.75, I must be careful about AABB 17's region and also AABB 8.
           
           Let's look for a new position. Since "left of" and "above/below" target (aligned with x) seem to be challenging due to surrounding obstacles, let's try a position at an angle.
           
           We have:
           1.  (-0.51, 1.0) - confirmed valid. This is below AABB 10.
           2.  (-0.51, 2.35) - confirmed valid. This is above AABB 10.
           
           Let's try a position diagonally to the left and below the target, staying clear of AABB 17 and AABB 8.
           AABB 17 is ((-0.897, 1.664), (-0.787, 1.774)).
           AABB 8 is ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)).
           
           Consider a point far to the left and below AABB 10 and AABB 17.
           Let's try x = -1.5. This is less than -0.897 (x-min of AABB 17) and less than -0.75 (x-min of AABB 10). It is also less than -0.05. It's also outside AABB 8's x-range from -2.25 to -1.75.
           Let's try y = 0.5. This is less than 1.664 (y-min of AABB 17) and less than 1.75 (y-min of AABB 10).
           Point: (-1.5, 0.5).
           Distance from target (-0.51, 1.82): sqrt((-1.5 - (-0.51))^2 + (0.5 - 1.82)^2) = sqrt((-0.99)^2 + (-1.32)^2) = sqrt(0.9801 + 1.7424) = sqrt(2.7225) = 1.65. This is < 2.
           This point is within the allowed x-range [-2.5, -0.05] and y-range [-0.18, 2.45].
           It seems to avoid all the known obstacles.
           
           Positions:
           (-0.51 1.0)
           (-0.51 2.35)
           (-1.5 0.5)

           The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point has changed *again* to (0.50, 1.97)! This is a critical detail I must continually monitor. All previous feedback related to target (-0.51, 1.82) is now mostly irrelevant for finding positions, but the collision feedback helps understand the environment.
           
           Let's analyze the feedback for target (0.50, 1.97):
           - (-0.51, 1.0) -- "not reachable for robot base". This makes sense now, as this point is on the left side of the x=0 wall (AABB 5), while the new target (0.50, 1.97) is on the right side. The x=0 wall would block line-of-sight. The "not reachable" error might be a generic term for collision/no line of sight for non-fixed obstacles or for being completely separated from the target by a major fixed obstacle.
           - (-0.51, 2.35) -- collided with AABB 1 (top wall: ((-2.55, 2.45), (2.55, 2.55))) and AABB 10 ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)).
               - The collision with AABB 1 (top wall) is understandable since y=2.35 is very close to its lower boundary of 2.45, and perhaps my margin was too small, or the robot itself has some height.
               - Collision with AABB 10 indicates that even at x=-0.51, my point was too close to this obstacle. Since target is at x=0.50, AABB 10 is to the left of the x=0 wall. My proposed point (-0.51, 2.35) is also to the left of the x=0 wall. AABB 10 is from x=-0.75 to -0.25, and y=1.75 to 2.25. My x=-0.51 *is* within this range. So I was trying to place the robot *inside* AABB 10. This is a critical error. My earlier assumption that AABB 10 *contained* the target was for a *previous* target, not this one.
           
           - (-1.5, 0.5) -- "no line of sight to target". This is again because the point is on the left side of AABB 5 and the target is on the right side.
           
           Now, for the *correct* target point (0.50, 1.97).
           Max range of 2 from target means:
           x range: [0.50 - 2, 0.50 + 2] = [-1.5, 2.5]. Intersecting with robot limits [-2.5, 2.5], this gives [-1.5, 2.5].
           y range: [1.97 - 2, 1.97 + 2] = [-0.03, 3.97]. Intersecting with robot limits [-2.5, 2.5], this gives [-0.03, 2.5].
           
           Since the target is at x=0.50, I must place the robot on the *right* side of the x=0 wall (AABB 5). So x > 0.05.
           Thus, the effective x range for the robot is [0.05, 2.5].
           The effective y range is [-0.03, 2.5]. I need to stay clear of the top wall, so y < 2.45.
           
           Let's identify obstacles in the current valid region [0.05, 2.5] for x and [-0.03, 2.45] for y.
           - AABB 7 ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)): This is a block in the top-right quadrant. My target (0.50, 1.97) is to the left of this.
           - AABB 9 ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)): This is very close to the target! Target x=0.50 is within [0.25, 0.75]. Target y=1.97 is within [1.75, 2.25]. So this time, the target *is* inside AABB 9. This means I must place the robot *outside* AABB 9 to view the target.
           
           So I need to place the robot around AABB 9.
           AABB 9 is from x: 0.25 to 0.75, y: 1.75 to 2.25.
           
           1.  **To the right of AABB 9:**
               - I need x > 0.75. Let's try x = 1.0. This is within range [0.05, 2.5].
               - Y can be around the target's y. Let's try y = 1.97.
               - Point: (1.0, 1.97).
               - Distance from target (0.50, 1.97): sqrt((1.0 - 0.50)^2 + (1.97 - 1.97)^2) = 0.5. This is < 2.
               - Check for other obstacles:
                   - AABB 7 ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)): (1.0, 1.97) is to the left of this.
                   - AABB 21 ((0.45, 1.92), (0.54, 2.01)): This is part of AABB 9, so (1.0, 1.97) is to the right.
               - This seems like a good position.
           
           2.  **Below AABB 9:**
               - I need y < 1.75. Let's try y = 1.0.
               - X can be around the target's x. Let's try x = 0.50.
               - Point: (0.50, 1.0).
               - Distance from target (0.50, 1.97): sqrt((0.50 - 0.50)^2 + (1.0 - 1.97)^2) = 0.97. This is < 2.
               - Check for other obstacles:
                   - AABB 13 ((2.10, 1.07), (2.22, 1.18)): Far to the right.
                   - AABB 14 ((-0.28, 0.58), (-0.13, 0.73)): This is on the left side of x=0.
               - This seems like a good position.
           
           3.  **To the left of AABB 9 (but still right of x=0 wall):**
               - This is a tight spot because AABB 5 (x=0 wall) is right there.
               - I need x between 0.05 and 0.25.
               - Let's try x = 0.15.
               - Y can be around the target's y. Let's try y = 1.97.
               - Point: (0.15, 1.97).
               - Distance from target (0.50, 1.97): sqrt((0.15 - 0.50)^2 + (1.97 - 1.97)^2) = 0.35. This is < 2.
               - Check for other obstacles:
                   - AABB 5 (x=0 wall): My x=0.15 is greater than 0.05, so it's to the right.
                   - AABB 9: My x=0.15 is less than 0.25, so it's to the left.
               - This seems like a good position, but it is in a very constrained area.
           
           Positions:
           (1.0 1.97)
           (0.50 1.0)
           (0.15 1.97)
