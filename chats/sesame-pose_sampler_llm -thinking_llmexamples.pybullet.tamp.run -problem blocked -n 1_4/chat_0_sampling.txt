(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5, a 0.07m x 0.07m square, on surface 0, defined by the points (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0).  A stable placement is simply a 4-tuple: `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`. `surf_idx` will always be 0 in this case.  The key is to ensure the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) remains *fully* inside the surface's bounding box.
           
           Since the object is tiny compared to the surface (0.6m x 0.6m), I have plenty of space. I'll take advantage of that and spread the placements around and across various orientations. First, I need to figure out the effective "clearance" needed, the smallest distance an edge of the object's AABB has to be from any edge of the surface.  Since the object is a square, at any angle, the AABB clearance is the same for the x and y axes.  I calculate this for different `theta` values.
           
           Let `S` be the object side length (0.07m).  The effective half-width/height `h_eff` of the AABB changes based on rotation. The formulas are: `h_eff = 0.5 * S * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.  At 0, pi/2, pi, and 3*pi/2 radians, `h_eff` is simply 0.035m. At pi/4, it's 0.035 * sqrt(2), which is approximately 0.0495m.  I then use this clearance value to determine the valid placement area on the surface.
           
           I'm aiming for good coverage using five rotations: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, and pi/2 radians. Then, within the valid x and y placement ranges for each `theta` value, I'll generate 10 evenly spaced placements, making for the total 50 placements I'm after.  To cover the area, the placements at any given angle are corners, midpoints of edges, center, and an offset point to generate some distinction among the placements.
           
           This methodical generation ensures stability for all placements since each `(x, y)` position and `theta` value I'm calculating meets the requirement that the object's AABB stays entirely inside the surface's AABB.

(Thoughts: **Understanding and Implementing Collision Avoidance**
           
           Based on feedback, I'm now tasked with placing object ID 10 on surface 0, while avoiding collisions with previously "placed" objects, specifically those related to object ID 5. The size of object 10 is almost a square with a side length of approximately `0.080323`. The surface is defined as `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.
           
           The process of calculating the effective half-extent (`h_eff`) for a rotated object remains the same, taking into account different angles (`theta`). I need to find valid placement ranges for object ID 10 at various rotations on the surface.
           
           The crucial instruction is to avoid collisions with other objects that have been previously placed. Since I received a list of successful placement coordinates from a previous ID 5 request, these coordinates represent "fixed obstacles" that I need to avoid now. I can't just consider the physical bounds of the surface and object's geometry; I must also account for previous ID 5's placements.
           
           To determine non-colliding positions for object ID 10, I've to first identify the axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) for all successful placements of object ID 5 (using their coordinates and known dimensions) from the previous round. These AABBs will act as forbidden zones on the surface. Next, I will place object ID 10 on a finely discretized grid, while calculating the AABB of each rotated object. I will then perform collision detection between object 10's AABB and the AABBs of ID 5's placements. I'll retain only those positions for ID 10 that do not collide with ID 5 placements. I'll repeat the process for several orientations to try and fulfill the placement request.
