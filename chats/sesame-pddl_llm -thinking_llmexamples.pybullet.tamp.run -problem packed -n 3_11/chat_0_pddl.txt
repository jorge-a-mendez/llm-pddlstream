           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's how I'm thinking about solving this stacking problem:**
           
           The overall goal is to get three objects (`v8`, `v12`, and `v14`) onto a specific surface (`v16`).  To do this, I need to use the robot's arm (specifically `v4`, since it's the only *controllable* arm) to move these objects.  I see that currently, all three objects are supported by a different surface (`v11`).  I also know that they can be *stacked* on both `v10` and `v16`.  The key here is that I need to *place* them at a *specific* pose, `#o2`, and since I know that pose `#o2` *does* allow me to support all objects to target surface, `v16`.
           
           My plan breaks down into these steps:
           
           1.  **Move to the right base configuration:**  The robot needs to be in base configuration `#o3` for all pick and place actions. It's currently at `v3`, so I'll generate a move_base action to make sure the robot is moved. This will require the action: `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`.
           
           2.  **Pick and place the first object, v8:**  This means I need to `pick` it from its current pose (`v9`) and then `place` it at the target pose (`#o2`) using the provided grasp (`#o1`). I have kin relations that tell me how to do this for the robot's arm `v4`.
           
           3.  **Repeat for v12:** I need to `pick` object `v12` from `v13` with the common grasp `#o1`, and then `place` it at pose `#o2`. I need to execute `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4` and `place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`.
           
           4.  **Finally, move v14:**  I'll pick up `v14` from `v15` using grasp `#o1` with the available grasp, and then place it at `#o2`.  This again with specific pick and place actions, and the appropriate kin relations.
           
           I understand that the preconditions for these pick and place actions are critical:
           *   I have to be in the correct base configuration (`#o3`).
           *   The arm needs to be free (`handempty`).
           *   The robot must be able to move (`canmove`).
           *   The objects have to be at the correct poses.
           *   I'll assume collisions are avoided, and will keep these requirements false as long as I don't get any information to the contrary.
           
           Once I execute this sequence, I should have successfully stacked all three objects onto `v16`. The important is that I use the given facts to determine the poses and surfaces and the objects involved.
