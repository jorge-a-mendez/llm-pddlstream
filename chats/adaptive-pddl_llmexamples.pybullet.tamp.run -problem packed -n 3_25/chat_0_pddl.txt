           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object

           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)

           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes several objects (v8, v12, v14) that are currently on object v11. The goal is to move all these objects to object v16. We are given the current poses of these objects (v8 at v9, v12 at v13, v14 at v15) and their potential poses on v16 (denoted by #o2). We also know that v8, v12, and v14 are graspable, and can be stacked on v10 and v16. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, both are at their home configurations and are handempty. The robot can also move.
           
           However, the only allowed action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action moves the robot's base from configuration v3 to v3, using trajectory #o0. This means the robot doesn't actually change its base position. There are no pick or place actions provided in the allowed action instances. Without pick and place actions, the robot cannot manipulate any objects to move them from v11 to v16. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
