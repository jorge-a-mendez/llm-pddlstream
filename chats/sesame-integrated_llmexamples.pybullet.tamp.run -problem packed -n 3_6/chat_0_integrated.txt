           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.136, -0.505, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.908, 0.419).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.053, -0.28), (0.035, -0.192)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.156, -0.475), (-0.08, -0.4)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.086, -0.554), (0.185, -0.455)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.009, -0.236, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.806, 0.592).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.118, -0.438, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.736, 0.677).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable objects, v8, v12, and v14, currently supported on object v11 (a table). The goal is to place all three objects on object v16, which is another surface. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, but only v4 is relevant to the given action instances. The robot starts at base configuration v3 and arm configuration v5. There are several pre-computed poses (v9, v13, v15) for objects v8, v12, and v14 respectively, and also a wildcard pose #o2 which represents a pose on object v10 or v16. The task requires finding collision-free placements on v16 for v8, v12, and v14.
           
           Since the goal is to place all three objects on v16, we need to pick up each object from its current location and place it on v16. We will use the arm v4 for this.
           
           The plan will involve picking up each object and placing it on v16. Since there's only one continuous pose #o2 that is supported by v16, we will use it for all three objects. We need to define three distinct continuous values for #o2, one for each object, to ensure they don't collide.
           
           First, pick v8 from v9 and place it on #o2 (on v16).
           Then, pick v12 from v13 and place it on #o2 (on v16).
           Finally, pick v14 from v15 and place it on #o2 (on v16).
           
           All `pick` and `place` actions will use the same grasp #o1, base configuration #o3, and arm trajectory #o4. We also need to define a base motion for the robot. Since the robot is already at v3, and the action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` is allowed, we can use it to satisfy the `canmove()` precondition if needed. However, `pick` and `place` actions themselves make `canmove()` true, so a `move_base` action is not strictly necessary between pick/place pairs.
           
           The provided `kin` facts indicate that the arm `v4` can reach both the initial poses (v9, v13, v15) and the target pose (#o2) for all objects while the robot is at base configuration #o3. Thus, a base motion to #o3 will be needed before the first pick and after the last place if #o3 is different from v3. However, since the `kin` facts state `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)` and `atbconf(v3)`, we must move to #o3 before picking if v3 and #o3 are different. If they are the same, no move is necessary. The action `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)` is available. After the last place, we do not need to move back if it is not required by the goal.
           
           Let's assume #o3 is a base configuration that allows the arm to reach all required locations. We will need to define a value for #o3 if it is different from v3. The problem statement says `bconf(#o3)` is an atom, but not `atbconf(#o3)`. We need to use `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` to reach this configuration.
           
           The initial state has `atbconf(v3)` and `kin` actions that refer to `#o3`. Thus, we need to transition to `#o3` first.

Model:     The previous attempt to place objects v12 and v14 on v16 resulted in unstable poses. Let's re-evaluate the object and surface dimensions to find stable placements.
           
           The surface v16 has AABB = ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 has AABB = ((-0.053, -0.28), (0.035, -0.192)). (This seems to be an error in the provided AABB for v8; it should be relative to the object's origin for placement. Let's assume for now that the provided AABBs for objects are their extents, meaning their "width" and "length" are derived from these, and we center them on the specified x, y for stability.)
           Let's re-evaluate based on the feedback about the AABB of the objects. The error message indicates for v12, the AABB is (AABB(lower=(0.06500000149011612, -0.035), upper=(0.13500000149011612, 0.035))). This implies that the x-extent of v12 is (0.135 - 0.065) = 0.07 and the y-extent is (0.035 - (-0.035)) = 0.07. Similarly for v14, the AABB implies x-extent = 0.07 and y-extent = 0.07. These are likely dimensions relative to the object's center or a canonical point. Let's assume objects v8, v12, and v14 have similar small square footprints, and their provided AABBs are just the extents, rather than their full pose. The surface v16 has a square footprint with side length 0.27 (0.135 - (-0.135)).
           
           To ensure stability, the center of the object must be within the bounds of the surface, considering half of the object's dimensions. For example, if an object has a width W and length L, and the surface has x_range and y_range, the object's center (x, y) should satisfy:
           min_x_surf + W/2 <= x <= max_x_surf - W/2
           min_y_surf + L/2 <= y <= max_y_surf - L/2
           
           Let's assume the objects are roughly 0.07x0.07 in size. To place three objects on v16, we need to distribute them within v16's AABB ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). We will center the objects in the z-axis at 0.781. The theta can be 0.
           
           For v8, let's try (0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0). This would center it on the surface.
           For v12, let's try (0.0, 0.05, 0.781, 0.0). This will place it slightly offset.
           For v14, let's try (0.0, -0.05, 0.781, 0.0). This will place it slightly offset.
           
           Let's recheck the AABBs from the previous error for v12 and v14 on surface v16.
           v12 AABB was `(AABB(lower=(0.065, -0.035), upper=(0.135, 0.035)))`. If the pose is (x, y, z, theta), then the object's AABB corners would be (x+0.065, y-0.035) to (x+0.135, y+0.035).
           If we want to place it at `(0.0, 0.05, 0.781, 0.0)`, its bounding box would be `((0.065, 0.015), (0.135, 0.085))`.
           The surface AABB is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           The object's bounding box `((0.065, 0.015), (0.135, 0.085))` *is* contained within the surface AABB. Let's re-confirm this for all three objects.
           
           It is likely that the AABB provided for objects v8, v12, v14 are their absolute AABBs in the current state, not their relative dimensions. The error message implies that the *relative* AABBs of the objects are:
           v12: x-extent 0.07, y-extent 0.07. Center at (0.1, 0.0) with respect to the initial pose `v13`. No, the given AABB `(AABB(lower=(0.065, -0.035), upper=(0.135, 0.035)))` is relative to the object's origin. The center of this relative AABB is at (0.1, 0.0). So if we place it at (x, y), its AABB is `(x+0.065, y-0.035)` to `(x+0.135, y+0.035)`.
           
           To center the object on the surface, its relative AABB should be centered with respect to the surface. So the object's center `(x_obj_center, y_obj_center)` should be `(x_surf_center, y_surf_center)`.
           Surface v16 AABB `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))` has center `(0.0, 0.0)`.
           For v12, if its internal AABB is centered at `(0.1, 0.0)`, then for the object's overall bounding box to be centered at `(0.0, 0.0)` of the surface, the actual pose `(x, y)` for the object should be `(-0.1, 0.0)`.
           So for `v12` with AABB `(AABB(lower=(0.065, -0.035), upper=(0.135, 0.035)))`, if its pose is `(-0.1, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)`, its absolute AABB would be `((-0.1+0.065, 0.0-0.035), (-0.1+0.135, 0.0+0.035))` which is `((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035))`. This is perfectly within `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           Let's try:
           v8: use pose (0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0). Let's assume v8 has a similar relative AABB that is roughly centered. From the initial AABB for v8: ((-0.053, -0.28), (0.035, -0.192)), it seems its center is not (0,0). Let's assume these are its absolute positions. If its width is 0.035 - (-0.053) = 0.088 and height is -0.192 - (-0.28) = 0.088. So if v8 is centered at (x,y), its AABB is `(x-0.044, y-0.044)` to `(x+0.044, y+0.044)`.
           v12: relative AABB center `(0.1, 0.0)`. Pose `(-0.1, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           v14: relative AABB center `(0.1, 0.0)` (assuming similar structure to v12). Pose `(-0.1, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)`. To differentiate them, we must shift them.
           
           Let's assume the actual dimensions of the objects are roughly 0.07x0.07 and the provided "lower" and "upper" for AABBs in the error message are actually for the object's bounding box relative to its own origin.
           For v12, relative AABB: `(lower=(0.065, -0.035), upper=(0.135, 0.035))`. If we place this at pose (x,y), its actual coordinates range from (x+0.065, y-0.035) to (x+0.135, y+0.035).
           For v14, relative AABB: `(lower=(-0.135, -0.035), upper=(-0.065, 0.035))`. If we place this at pose (x,y), its actual coordinates range from (x-0.135, y-0.035) to (x-0.065, y+0.035).
           
           We need to place three objects. Let's find suitable x, y positions such that their bounding boxes (relative to their own origin) fit into the surface v16, and they don't overlap.
           Surface v16 AABB: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           Let's use a common relative AABB like `((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035))` (a 0.07x0.07 square centered at the origin) for all three objects for simplicity and to ensure stability within the 0.27x0.27 surface. This is a common assumption when exact relative AABBs are not known for all objects, but only from error messages for specific objects.
           If all objects are approximately 0.07x0.07 and we want to place them on v16 which is 0.27x0.27, we have plenty of space.
           Let's choose these poses:
           v8: (0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           v12: (0.0, 0.07, 0.781, 0.0)
           v14: (0.0, -0.07, 0.781, 0.0)
           
           With these poses, each object's 0.07x0.07 footprint would be contained within v16's boundaries, and they would not overlap.
           The z-coordinate for all objects on the table is 0.781. We use this z-value.
           For the base configuration #o3, the problem statement says `bconf(#o3)`. Since `atbconf(v3)` and `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)` are given, we need to move to #o3. If no value is provided for #o3, it will be a free variable. From the list of predefined continuous values, only `v3` is a base configuration. The `kin` relations imply that the robot base moves to `#o3` for the arm to reach the object poses. Let's assume for now that #o3 is identical to v3 since it is the only explicit base configuration given besides #o3. This avoids needing to define it. However, the problem statement *requires* a value for `#o3` if it is used. So let's provide a value for `#o3`. A reasonable value would be the initial base pose of v3: (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
