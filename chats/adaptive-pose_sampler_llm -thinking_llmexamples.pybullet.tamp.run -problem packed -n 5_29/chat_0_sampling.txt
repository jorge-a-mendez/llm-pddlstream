           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Here's my thought process:**
           
           I need to generate 50 stable placements for a near-square object on a square surface.  The key is to define "stable," which means the object must be fully within the surface's boundaries. Since the object is nearly square, and the surface is square, the rotation shouldn't significantly impact the valid placement area.
           
           My strategy: I'll use two orientations, 0 and pi/2 radians. For each orientation, I'll create a 5x5 grid of (x, y) coordinates within the allowed bounds. This grid distribution will provide 25 placements at 0 radians and 25 at pi/2 radians. This strategy gives us a total of 50 stable positions and offers variation across rotation and x, y coordinates.
           I'll begin by analyzing object and surface parameters to calculate valid placement regions.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for a New Object**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new request: to place Object 4 (size 0.08666) on Surface 0, avoiding collision with Object 5 (size 0.09389).  Object 5 is already placed at roughly (-0.088, -0.088) with theta = 0. I need to find 50 stable placements for Object 4.
           
           First, I need to figure out Object 5's occupied space. It’s pretty much in the bottom-left corner of the surface, at about `[(-0.135, -0.135), (-0.0411, -0.0411)]`.  Object 4's surface is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))` and will have a similar-sized bounding box.
           
           The key is avoiding collision. For two AABBs, they collide if one's max corner is greater than the other's min. So, I must ensure Object 4's bounding box doesn’t overlap Object 5’s. Since these are square-ish, I’ll assume rotations of 0 or pi/2 for Object 4 to simplify.
           
           I calculate a safety zone for Object 4's center;  it has to stay inside the surface, and outside Object 5's bounds.  Since Object 5 lives in the bottom-left, I know the placements will be centered mainly in the upper and right sectors. This means that if the object's centers are on `[0.0022, 0.0916] x [-0.0916, 0.0916]` or `[-0.0916, 0.0916] x [0.0022, 0.0916]` on Surface 0, no collision occurs.
           
           To find those points, I decided to use a grid-based approach. I generated an 8x8 grid of points for one orientation (theta=0), checking each point against the collision condition. Then, to have some variety, I'll calculate the rotations and do the same.
           
           In my first pass, I got 40 points so I increased the grid density. I adjusted the density and now have a system to find the placements:
           
           1.  Generate a 7x7 grid for theta=0, apply the collision check. (x & y steps calculated with the Surface area).
           2.  Generate a 6x6 grid for theta=pi/2, filter the collisions (x & y steps calculated with the surface area).
           3.  Each point generated will have a specific surface location (cx, cy) and theta.
           
           This should give me 50 collision-free placements across a grid, and it does! I've confirmed that with the constraints, it's possible to place a total of 50 objects and avoid collisions on a surface.

(Thoughts: **Understanding the Scene and Planning Placements for Object 8**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for "Object 8" on "Surface 0." I need to consider the current positions of "Object 5" and "Object 4" to avoid collisions.
           
           **Surface Details**
           
           "Surface 0" is a square, centered at (0, 0) with a side length of 0.27, extending from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           **Existing Objects**
           
           -   **Object 5:** Located in the bottom-left of the surface. Its approximate bounding box is ((-0.135, -0.135), (-0.041, -0.041)).
           -   **Object 4:** Located to the middle-left of the surface. Its approximate bounding box is ((-0.135, -0.013), (-0.048, 0.074)).
           
           **Object 8 Details**
           
           "Object 8" is a square object with side length of approximately 0.0988, that means its half-extents will be equal to 0.0494. The rotation angle won't affect the calculations, as it's a square.
           
           **Placement Strategy**
           
           I will use a grid-based approach to generate potential placement positions. I need to avoid the bounding boxes of "Object 4" and "Object 5". Since the objects cover the lower left area, the solution would be to generate the grid along the right half, in x, starting the calculations from x>=0.0083 and covering the whole y-range. I will consider two orientations, 0 and pi/2 radians.
           
           **Collision Avoidance**
           
           1.  **Generate a Grid:** I'll set up a 9x9 grid within the valid x and y ranges on "Surface 0," where the minimum of x,y is at -0.085592 and the maximum is 0.085592. I'll evaluate 0 and pi/2 radians.
           2.  **AABB collision checks:**  To check for collisions, I'll calculate the Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) for "Object 8" at each grid point. I'll compare its AABB with the AABBs of "Object 5" and "Object 4" to identify and exclude colliding positions.
           
           **Valid Placements**
           
           The algorithm should find 72 stable placements by iterating through the grid and the orientations. This number is bigger than the desired amount of stable placements. To get 50, I'll just pick the first 50 stable ones. This should provide the first 50 non-colliding positions for "Object 8".

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable locations for `Object 7` on `Surface 0`. The challenge lies in ensuring `Object 7` doesn't collide with the existing objects: `Object 5`, `Object 4`, and `Object 8`, all of which have known positions and dimensions.
           
           First, I define the valid area for `Object 7`'s center on `Surface 0`. Then, I accurately calculate the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for each of the pre-existing objects, `Object 5`, `Object 4`, and `Object 8`. This sets the foundation for precise collision detection.
           
           To find valid placements, I generate a grid of potential center points for `Object 7` within the valid surface area, focusing on finding good starting positions, while also giving focus to the upper-right area. I also considered a few possible rotations, 0 and 90 degrees. For each candidate location, I calculate Object 7's AABB and check for any overlaps (collisions) with the AABBs of the existing objects.
           
           I will iterate through these possible positions, check for any collisions with the existing objects, and add each placement to the list of valid locations.
