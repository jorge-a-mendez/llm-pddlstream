           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Planning Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The goal is to get those four objects – `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` – stacked on `v18`. From the initial state analysis, it looks like they're all currently resting on `v11`. The crucial bit is, all these objects have their respective `atpose` facts, and, importantly, there are target `atpose` locations for them on `v18` represented by `#o2`. I need to figure out the right sequence of actions to move each object to that target position on `v18`. The initial state gives me kinematic information (`kin`) for both picking and placing each object, provided the robot's base is at configuration `#o3`, however, initially the robot is in configuration `v3`. This suggests a base movement at the beginning of the plan is necessary to be able to execute any of the available `kin` actions. I am going to have to do a `move_base`. The robot arm `v4` and the target placement configuration `#o2` seem like the right things to use for this task, as per the initial facts. Now that I have the initial state, I can start to form the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired goal. My plan is: move base, pick, and place.
           
           **Detailed Plan**
           
           1.  **Move Base:** I will start with a `move_base` action to move the robot base from its current configuration, `v3`, to the required configuration, `#o3`. The required action here is, `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`.
           
           2.  **Pick and Place Sequence:** I'm going to iterate through the four objects. For each one, the process is:
           
               a.  **Pick:** Use the `pick` action to grasp the object from its current location, for example, `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)` for `v8`. The initial kinematics ensure that this pick action is possible.
               b.  **Place:** Use the `place` action to place the object at the target pose `#o2` on `v18`, for example, `(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)` for `v8`. This action also requires the correct kinematics.
           
           This sequence of actions will repeat for `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`, respectively, leading to achieving the desired goal state.
           
           **Justification**
           
           The solution I have come up with involves moving base, picking, and placing the objects from its initial configuration onto the given target position on surface `v18`. I know each object is pickable and placeable as per initial state information. Each `kin` operation requires the base to be in configuration `#o3` and `move_base` is needed to achieve this. Finally, the placement pose `#o2` is present on the given supporting object `v18`.
           
           After this, all the preconditions for all necessary `pick` and `place` actions will be met. The order in which the objects are stacked doesn't matter, as there are no dependencies between them. After this, all the goals will be satisfied and the plan can be considered as complete.
