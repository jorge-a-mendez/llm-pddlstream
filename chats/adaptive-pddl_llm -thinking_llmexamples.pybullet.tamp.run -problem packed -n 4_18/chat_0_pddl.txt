           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unreachable**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` all `on` object `v18`. That means they need to be at a specific pose, `p`, where they are supported by `v18`. Looking at the initial state, it's clear these objects are currently on `v11`. There's a potential pose, `#o2`, that would put them on `v18`, but they aren't *at* that pose yet.
           
           My initial thought is to `pick` each object from `v11` and `place` them on `v18`.  That's the intuitive solution.  I've got the `on` axiom down, I understand the `supported` and `atpose` constraints.  I also understand that I need a `pick` and `place` action for this.
           
           Analyzing the problem further, I see that I have `grasp` facts for each object, that's good. But here's the kicker: the *only* action I'm allowed to use is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This move doesn't affect the poses of the objects at all!  It’s just moving the base, which is useless for the task at hand.  That action doesn't let me do a `pick` or a `place`.
           
           The `pick` and `place` actions need `kin` facts, which are *not* provided in the initial state or the allowed actions.  So even if I wanted to, I *can't* legally `pick` or `place` anything. The provided action `move_base` is clearly irrelevant to moving objects.
           
           The conclusion is unavoidable:  I have a goal, but I lack the actions to accomplish it. The goal is unreachable given the restricted action set. I can't move these objects with the given allowed action.
