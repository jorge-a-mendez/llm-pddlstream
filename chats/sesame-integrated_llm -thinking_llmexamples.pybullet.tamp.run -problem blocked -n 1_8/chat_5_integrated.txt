           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Planning to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My objective is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of type `v17` be "on" the surface `v18`.  Through analysis, I've identified `v12` as the object of interest (it has type `v17`), and the task is to place it "on" surface `v18`.
           
           The "on" relation is defined in terms of support and pose. To get `v12` on `v18`, I need a pose `?p` for `v12` such that it's supported by `v18` and at that pose. I know that `v12` is *already* supported at a specific pose initially, but on a different surface `v14`. I'm also given a possible pose `#p0` that is supported by `v18`.
           
           My strategy will be to use a robotic arm, `v4`, to pick `v12` up from its current location, and then place it onto `v18` at pose `#p0`. This will involve the following actions:
           
           1.  **Move the base (`v3`)** to a configuration (`#q2`) that allows the arm to pick `v12` from its current pose (`v13`).
           2.  **Pick `v12`**:  The arm (`v4`) will pick up `v12` from `v13`.
           3.  **Move the base** (`#q2`) to a configuration (`#q3`) that facilitates placing the object.
           4.  **Place `v12`**: The arm will place `v12` at the target pose `#p0`.
           
           To successfully execute these actions, I need to assume that certain preconditions related to base and arm movement and grasps are met, specifically those concerning *being* in specific configurations (`atbconf`) and that the robot can *move*.  I will also need to assume that placing/picking can be done safely without violating any geometrical constraints - *no unsafe approaches, poses, or trajectories.*
           
           Regarding the *specific* pose, `#p0`, I need to ground it in concrete spatial coordinates. Based on the AABBs and initial pose information, I've deduced that placing the object at (`4.5`, `-0.3`, `0.802`) relative to the world coordinate system is a valid and reasonable choice for `#p0`.  Given initial poses for the green object `v12`, the z-coordinate value (`0.802`) seems reasonable, and the target placement (x,y) coordinates within the target surface.
