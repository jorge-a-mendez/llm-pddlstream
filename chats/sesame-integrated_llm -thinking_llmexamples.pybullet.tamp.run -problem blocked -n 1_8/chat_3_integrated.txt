           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.647, 0.452, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.878, -0.478).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object p3 is a pose with position (4.5, -0.3, 0.802) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((3.14, -0.294), (4.548, 0.526)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.696, 0.403), (-4.599, 0.5)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Finalized Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to make `new-axiom@0()` true. It boils down to getting the object `v12` onto the surface `v18`. From the goal expansion, I know `v12` has type `v17` (which is already true in the initial state), and I need to place `v12` *on* `v18`.  "On" means it's supported and at a pose. The initial state already tells me it is supported at a specific pose `#o2`.
           
           Since `v12` is *currently* at a different pose (`v13`) and supported by different surface (`v14`), and the arm is free and base is ready to move. This means I need the following steps.
           
           1.  **Move the Robot Base:** First I'll execute `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`. This moves the robot's base configuration from its current state (`v3`) to a new configuration (`#o3`). This ensures the robot can get closer to `v12` to pick.
           
           2.  **Pick Up the Object:**  I will then use `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)` to pick up the object `v12` from its current pose `v13`.
           
           3.  **Place the Object:** The final action is `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`, where I place `v12` onto the surface `v18` by moving it to pose `#o2`  with the specified grasp (`#o1`) from the current base configuration (`#o3`) and avoiding the trajectory `#o4`. This is the solution!
           
           I need to provide a real value for the pose `#o2`, and now I see that since the current coordinate and dimensions indicate it's small, a reasonable pose `(4.5, -0.3, 0.802, 0.0)` fits the bill. The value `(4.5, -0.3)` puts it directly on surface `v18`, with a reasonable value for z. I picked 0.0 for theta.
           
           All the preconditions for each action are met by the initial state and each effect ensures the preconditions of the next, making this plan valid.  This plan assumes no unsafe approach or trajectory states (for simplicity).
