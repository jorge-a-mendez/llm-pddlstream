           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've devised to satisfy the goal of having an object be 'on' a surface, given my current knowledge of the world and available actions. As a TAMP expert, I've used my skills to break down the problem and come up with the most efficient solution.**
           
           My immediate goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to the condition of having an object of type `v17` be placed 'on' the surface `v18`. After analyzing the initial state, I see that object `v8` fits the bill as a type `v17` and that it is *supported* on `v18`. My plan is to utilize the robot's arm and base to physically manipulate `v8` to be 'on' `v18`.
           
           Here's how I'll achieve this:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  The robot's base currently is at the pose `v3`. I need to move it to a suitable location, which I've determined as `#o3`. The movement uses a straight-line motion to move from base configuration `v3` to `#o3`.
           2.  **Pick:** The next step is to pick `v8` from its current pose, `v9`.
           3.  **Place:** Finally, I'll place `v8` on surface `v18`. I've calculated the best pose for `v8` on `v18` and assigned it as the value of `#o2`.
           
           **Here are the specific, continuous parameters I've identified:**
           
           *   **`#o2` (Pose for `v8`):**  This pose defines the exact position of `v8` on `v18` as (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0), a location within the bounds of `v18`.  Given the physical attributes of both `v8` and `v18`, I've determined that this pose ensures stable placement and full containment of the object within the surface. The value (0.0) is the Z-axis rotation. The position's Z value is consistent with other pose locations.
           *   **`#o3` (Base Configuration):** This represents a specific location and orientation for the robot's base, which I've set as (4.5, 0.0, 0.0). This position allows for reaching `v9` and the calculated placement on `v18`, ensuring my goal can be fulfilled. The default orientation (0.0) is chosen.
           *   The other parameters (such as trajectories and grasp values) are handled implicitly by the planner and I don't need to specify them.
           
           **In summary, the plan to satisfy the goal is:**
           *   Move the base to the right position.
           *   Pick up `v8`.
           *   Place `v8` in the target location, on surface `v18`.
           With the above actions, and the specified continuous parameter values, I can accomplish the overall objective and thus solve the problem at hand.
