           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for Stable Positions**
           
           My objective is to generate 50 stable placements for an object with dimensions approximately 0.0984 x 0.0984, within a 0.27 x 0.27 AABB surface.  Since the object is close to a square, ensuring stability involves calculating precise bounding boxes (AABBs) for various rotations.
           
           First, I define the surface and object dimensions. I will work with the surface: `0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I begin by calculating the half-width (`hw`) and half-height (`hh`) of the object's AABB: roughly 0.0492.  The key is that for a placement to be valid, the object's AABB must be *fully contained* within the surface's AABB.  This means its center's x and y must lie within a particular range determined by the rotation angle.
           
           For a rotation angle (theta) of 0, meaning no rotation, the object's bounding box has the same width and height as the object. The permissible range for x and y are easily calculated, with approximately `[-0.0857868, 0.0857868]`. I then derive a grid of 5 x 5 equally spaced points for the x and y coordinates that fully utilize this range.
           
           The significant challenge arises when considering rotation. I determine how rotations affect the object's AABB. Rotating an object by an angle theta requires the calculation of an effective bounding box:
           -   `half_bbox_width = max(abs(hw * cos(theta)) + abs(hh * sin(theta)), abs(hw * sin(theta)) + abs(hh * cos(theta)))`
           -   `half_bbox_height = max(abs(hw * sin(theta)) + abs(hh * cos(theta)), abs(hw * cos(theta)) + abs(hh * sin(theta)))`
           Since our object is almost square, I can use the formula and approximation `r = h * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`, where *h* is 0.0492. From here, I realize that the maximum bounding box size will occur at a rotation of 45 degrees (`pi/4` radians) and the minimum at 0. Therefore, the most constrained placement area occurs at `theta = pi/4`.
           
           So I calculate the maximum bounding box, with a radius of  `0.06959600100511874` when rotated at `pi/4`. The available range for x,y is `[-0.065404, 0.065404]` to ensure placement containment. I do the same and derive a 5x5 grid of equally spaced points for x,y.
           
           By strategically choosing (x, y, theta) coordinates, I guarantee the object fits within the bounding box. Specifically, I leverage rotations of 0 and `pi/4`. Using two 5x5 grids creates 50 total placements in the requested format: (surf\_idx, theta, x, y).

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed object 5, and now I need to figure out where to put object 6, ensuring it doesn't bump into object 5. The goal is 50 stable placements on surface 0, and I'm going to leverage my usual approach: analyze the space, define the no-go zones, and systematically explore the remaining valid placements.
           
           First, I've got to precisely map out the space occupied by object 5. It's essentially a box, and since it's at zero rotation, this is straightforward. I've calculated its AABB, which will be my no-go zone. I now know the bottom-left corner of object 5, which defines the region of the surface to avoid.
           
           Next up: Object 6. I know its dimensions, and like before, I'm generating placements considering both zero rotation (theta = 0) and a 45-degree rotation (theta = pi/4). I am planning to analyze the surface to exclude the area covered by object 5â€™s AABB for these cases. 
           
           I start with the theta = 0 case. I need to calculate the valid ranges for `x_6` and `y_6`, making sure to exclude the area of object 5. I do this by subtracting the half-extents of the objects, ensuring that the boundaries don't overlap, and thus collision-free. I then define the valid range for the center of the placement. 
           
           Because of the constraints imposed by object 5's position, I can refine the range for x and y by excluding the occupied region to ensure that object 6 does not collide with object 5. This translates to setting a collision threshold for x and y.
           
           The crucial part is the collision detection. I need to ensure that the bounding boxes of object 6 *don't* overlap with object 5's box. It's not about being contained, it's about not being inside. I need to make sure the AABB for object 6 does not overlap the area covered by object 5.
           
           I work out the valid region for the placement by enforcing the collision conditions: object 6 can't overlap object 5. I then create a grid covering the surface area and avoid positions in which collision happens. With this I derive a set of valid coordinates. I also repeat this reasoning with the 45-degree rotation angle, calculating the appropriate thresholds and applying the same logic to define the blocked regions.
           
           This approach gives me a set of placement possibilities for the x and y coordinates. I apply the no-overlap condition with `obj5` (so object 6 is outside). I then extend this strategy by defining the ranges of values for each coordinate to make sure the area does not intersect the bounding box of object 5. I also include other rotation angles like 90 and 135.
           
           I will start by generating 16 candidate placements for `theta = 0` and 16 placements for `theta = pi/4`. I then need to generate 5 placements for theta = pi/2 and 5 more for theta = 3*pi/4, but I also see that by slightly offsetting the grid with another 8 placements, I will satisfy the total of 50 stable placements I was aiming for.
           
           I'll check the validity of these generated placements by ensuring that the conditions that lead to collision do not happen in each of the considered scenarios. After generating, I just need to translate this logic into the appropriate structure and give the coordinates.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 4**
           
           I'm tasked with placing object ID 4 on surface 0, needing 50 stable positions, while avoiding collisions with objects ID 5 and 6, which are already in place. Surface 0 is a 0.27 x 0.27 square. Object 4 is almost square with dimensions 0.0988 x 0.0988.
           
           To manage this, I'm considering 4 orientations: 0, pi/4, pi/2, and 3pi/4 radians.  For each orientation, I first determine the effective bounding box dimensions (AABB) given the rotation.  Then I define the valid x and y ranges for the center point of object 4 within the surface, taking into account the object's dimensions and rotation.
           
           I will iterate through the orientations and sample x,y coordinates using linspace for the allowed ranges, and filter out any points where the AABB of my object collides with the AABB of Object 5 or Object 6. For this I create a function for the checks. I will carefully increase the number of x and y samples, especially for the case theta = 0, where tighter packing of objects might be easier.
           
           I've checked the AABB's for both objects 5 and 6. The AABB for object 5 is [-0.135, -0.03657] x [-0.135, -0.03657]. Object 6 has an AABB of [-0.135, -0.04017] x [-0.00362, 0.09121].
           
           The available space seems to concentrate mainly in the right half, due to the position of objects 5 and 6 at the bottom left and top left respectively. I'm focusing my sampling in the top-right and bottom-right corners, as well as the center column, where the potential for collision is reduced and the available space is maximized. I am looking for the coordinates that won't collide with the existing objects, so I can fit the requested 50 placements. I'm checking the non-collision conditions for this. 
           
           I'm calculating where those points exist by checking where the bounds are, and generating the required amount of points. The valid locations will then be combined for the positions, with a little filtering.  This approach is efficient, it checks collisions by getting the points from AABB bounding boxes.
