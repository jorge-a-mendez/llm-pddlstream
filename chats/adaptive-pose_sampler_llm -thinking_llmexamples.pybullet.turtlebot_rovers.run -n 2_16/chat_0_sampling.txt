           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Final Thoughts and Strategy for Robot Base Placement**
           
           Okay, so I'm aiming for three diverse robot base positions to capture the target point. The maximum distance I can be from the target is 2 units, and my movements are restricted to the area where x and y are within the range [-2.5, 2.5]. The robot's orientation will automatically adjust to face the target, so that's not a concern. The main challenge is avoiding collisions and ensuring clear lines of sight, considering all the fixed obstacles in the workspace.
           
           My initial analysis of the obstacles highlighted the crucial role of the vertical wall at x=0. It essentially divides the workspace, so if the target's on one side, I really want my base to be on the same side. The provided target point is at (0.1, 0.0), which puts it just to the right of that wall. This is key to figuring out the best locations for the robot.
           
           My plan is straightforward: I'll generate some candidate positions within a 2-unit radius of the target, but I'll focus on the positive x-axis due to the target's position. I'll then filter these candidates. I need to make sure they're within the workspace bounds, and, importantly, that there are no collisions. Collisions happen when the robot's base (I'm treating it as a point for simplicity) is inside one of the AABBs.
           
           After that, I'll check for line-of-sight. The segment from my proposed base position to the target needs to be clear of any obstacles. Any AABB intersecting that segment means the base would be occluded.
           
           So, for the (0.1, 0.0) target, I'm setting a search radius to 1.5 because I want some buffer. I considered candidate positions at a radius of 1.5 units and at angles 0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2 from the target. From that, I generated 4 positions.
           
           I then did an extensive check for collision using all the provided obstacle information. I did the same checks again for the line of sight (LOS), considering the vertical wall at x=0, and all the AABBs.
           
           The chosen positions are: (1.6, 0.0), (0.1, 1.5), and (0.1, -1.5). These are great. They're all close enough, they're free of collisions, and they guarantee a clear line of sight to the target. It's a nicely spread-out set, covering the right, top, and bottom of the target. These should work perfectly.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown:**
           
           Okay, here's what I've got. The user feedback on my last attempt revealed a crucial issue: the target point can *be* inside a fixed obstacle. That completely throws off line-of-sight calculations.  Specifically, in the last attempt, the target was inside Obstacle 9.  My prior reasoning was flawed because it didn't account for this possibility.
           
           The goal is to provide three diverse and collision-free positions for the robot, even if the target is unviewable due to being inside an obstacle. I need to make sure I'm providing a valid base position *from my perspective* and not worrying about whether that location will grant line-of-sight. The system will handle whether a given robot position grants line-of-sight.  The system just needs three base points.
           
           **Revised Strategy for the Current Request:**
           
           Here's my refined approach:
           
           1.  **Wall Buffer:** I need to maintain a safe distance from Obstacle 5, the central vertical wall (x=0). I'll ensure any proposed `x` coordinate is at least 0.15 units away from the wall.
           2.  **Obstacle Avoidance:** I must explicitly check for collisions with *all* fixed obstacles, not just the central wall.  I'll use a loop to check each candidate position against the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) of all the obstacles.
           3.  **Workspace Limits:**  I'll also constrain the robot's position to the workspace limits of `[-2.5, 2.5]` for both `x` and `y`.
           4.  **Target-Centered Positioning:** I'll generate base positions relative to the target, using a fixed distance (1.5 units) to maintain consistency.
           5.  **Directional Diversity:** To ensure good coverage, I'll attempt a range of angles from the target to get distinct and safe positions. This will be different from my previous attempt. I'll test each location and if the position collides I will adjust by re-trying the position with a nearby (rotated) angle.
           6.  **Avoid Edge Collisions**: When clamping to the boundary edge, I'm finding that is itself a problem. A candidate position at `(2.5, y)` is likely to be colliding with the top obstacle. I need to maintain positions within range.
           
           **Step-by-Step Implementation:**
           
           1.  **Target:** The current target is still  `T = (0.37388375401496887, 1.9229445457458496)` or approximately `T = (0.37, 1.92)` which lies inside Obstacle 9 `((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))`.  I know it's a fixed obstacle location. Therefore, any line-of-sight check will fail. I will, however, provide three base positions that respect all the rules, even if line-of-sight is impossible.
           
           2.  **Position Generation (Iterative):** I'll use a distance `r = 1.5` and test a few angles from the target point. This means, the target point `(x, y)` generates robot candidate position `(x + r*cos(theta), y + r*sin(theta))`, where `theta` is the angle from the target, and test for valid, no-collisions.
           
           3.  **Angle Checks:** I will test a range of angles and check for collision: `theta = [ -pi/4, -pi/6, pi/6]`
           
           4.  **Collision and Wall Check:** For each candidate position, I'll:
               *   Ensure the `x` component is sufficiently far from the wall. If needed I will adjust.
               *   Check for collisions with *all* obstacles using their AABBs.
               *   Adjust `x` or `y` coordinates to stay within the bounds `[-2.45, 2.45]`. If the target is close to the boundary, or if the best position lies close, the distance could be very slightly shortened.
               *   Iterate and move to other `theta` values.
           
           **Applying the Strategy (For this target point):**
           
           Using the given target point (0.37, 1.92):
           
           1.  I started with `theta = -pi/4` (down-right). This resulted in `(1.43453, 0.86229)` which passed obstacle and wall checks. So I made that position 1
