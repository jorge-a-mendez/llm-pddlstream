(Thoughts: **A Strategy for Stable Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I need to generate 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5, size 0.08458 x 0.08458) on a square surface (Surface 0, bounds (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135)). A "placement" means defining the surface index (0 in this case), rotation angle (theta), and the (x, y) coordinates of the object's center.  The core challenge is keeping the object *entirely* within the surface, considering how its bounding box (AABB) changes with rotation.
           
           Since it's a square object on a square surface, I'll optimize for a few key rotation angles. The most straightforward approach uses `theta = 0` (no rotation), which gives the widest possible range for placement. I've calculated the half-width and half-height of the AABB for *any* rotation using the formula: `half_width = half_height = (s/2) * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`, where 's' is the side of the square (0.08458).
           
           For the main placement group, `theta = 0`, the max safe (x,y) range is pretty wide (-0.09271 to 0.09271). I'll use a 5x5 grid of x and y values for this, giving 25 placements. Next, for the `theta = pi/4` case (45 degrees), the allowable range shrinks, so I'll use a 3x3 grid (9 more placements). I'll also explore with `theta = pi/2`. Finally, a few more placements are with `theta = pi/8`, this will also utilize a 7x grid. I'll make sure each placement is carefully chosen to ensure the object's bounding box stays within the surface bounds given its rotation.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object ID 4**
           
           Alright, here's the plan. I've been tasked with placing object ID 4, a square with side length ~0.07, onto surface 0. My main constraint: avoid colliding with object ID 5, already placed at `(-0.09, -0.09)` with size `0.084` at `theta=0`.
           
           First, I calculated object 5's Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) which is `-0.132` to `-0.0477` in both x and y. This will be the "no-go zone" for object 4. Then, I determined the AABB dimensions for object 4 for several common rotations.
           
           I'll start by checking all of the common rotations for a valid location where to place object 4:
           -   **`theta = 0` or `pi/2`:** Valid x/y center coordinates must be in `[-0.09998, 0.09998]`. To prevent collision, either the x or y coordinate of object 4's center must be greater than `-0.01269`.
           -   **`theta = pi/4`:** Valid x/y center coordinates must be in `[-0.08548, 0.08548]`. The x and y coordinates can be anywhere if they are not both within `[-0.08548, 0.0018]`
           -   **`theta = pi/8`:** Valid x/y center coordinates must be in `[-0.08924, 0.08924]`. The x and y coordinates can be anywhere if they are not both within `[-0.08924, -0.00194]`
           
           Finally, I developed a strategy to generate 50 stable placements, aiming to spread them out across the surface, but being very careful to *avoid* object 5's AABB.
           
           I will use three common rotations, `0`, `pi/2`, `pi/4`, and `pi/8` to distribute them amongst various valid coordinate sets for their respective rotations. 
           To determine the placements, I'll use the AABB and surface constraints to make a decision. I chose placement points to be roughly spread out across the valid surface locations. With that, I believe I have the 50 distinct placements of Object 4, avoiding any collision with Object 5.

(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements for Object ID 6 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've got this object, ID 6, a square with some specific dimensions (side `s_6 = 0.09357628486719266`), and I need to find 50 stable positions for it on surface 0.  Crucially, I need to avoid collisions with two other squares already placed, Object 4 and Object 5.
           
           First, I need to understand the constraints:
           
           *   **Surface Containment:** The surface is defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I need to ensure that, no matter the rotation, the entire AABB of Object 6 stays within these boundaries.  For any rotation (theta), the half-extent, `h_prime_6`, changes. For theta=0 or pi/2, `h_prime_6 = 0.046788`.
           *   **Collision Avoidance:**  Object 4 is positioned at  `(0, 0.0, -0.09, 0.0)` and Object 5 at `(0, 0.0, -0.09, -0.09)`. I've calculated their AABBs and now, Object 6 mustn't overlap with either of them. This is where I have to be careful, I need to be exact with my AABB collision check.
           
           I'm thinking, my strategy will be to:
           
           1.  **Prioritize Clear Areas:** I can see that Objects 4 and 5 form an L-shape in the bottom-left corner of the surface. So, the easiest route to avoid collisions will be to focus on placing Object 6 in the remaining large clear areas – the top and right sides. I'll need to figure out specific conditions to ensure that the bounding box of Object 6 does not intersect the union of the Object 4 and Object 5's AABBs. I'll need to use, based on the rotation (theta) the appropriate `h_prime`.
           2.  **Generate Candidate Placements:** I will create a structured grid of x and y coordinates that would encompass the valid space. For `theta = 0` (or `pi/2`), I'll try to find grid values that will give at least 50 valid placements.
           3.  **Collision Check:** Then I'll meticulously check each candidate placement, accounting for the `h_prime_6` and using a precise, thorough AABB intersection check.
           
           Since I have already solved cases of rotations `theta=0`, and `pi/4` (also `pi/2`, which is very similar to zero).
           
           I am confident, that using a set of well-placed values `x_coords` and `y_coords`, I can make an easy and effective way of calculating the placements.
           
           Specifically, I'm going to set `x_coords = [-0.08, -0.06, -0.04, -0.02, -0.005, 0.0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08]` and `y_coords = [-0.08, -0.06, -0.04, -0.02, 0.0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.085]`. And then I'll make the placement with `(0, 0.0, x, y)` for each `x, y` pair. I can select `0` to make them all `theta = 0`. This will give me `10 * 9 = 90` combinations which will ensure that I select 50 that don't collide.
           
           I'll iterate through `x_coords` then `y_coords` and I'm ready to select 50 placements.
