           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable with Provided Actions**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a planning problem, and my objective is to get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` onto object `v20`. The logic here is pretty straightforward: to have something "on" another object, I need to find a suitable pose (`p`) where the `supported` predicate holds, and then move the object to that pose using the `atpose` predicate.
           
           I started by breaking down the initial and goal states for each object. It became clear that each object currently sits on `v11` and needs to end up on `v20`. The provided facts suggested a route using a specific pose, `#o2`, to achieve the goal arrangement. I realized I'd need a sequence of `pick` and `place` actions for each object to make this happen.  `v20` seems like the target location.
           
           I looked at the available resources and constraints. I've got two arms, `v4` and `v6`, and a base configuration `v3`. The crucial point, though, is the *only* allowed action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This is where the problem hits a snag. To actually move an object, I absolutely need `pick` and `place` actions, which are not in the approved list.
           
           Thinking through it, `pick` needs `kin` configurations for grasping, and `place` needs similar configurations for a target pose. All these, combined with base positions and the `atbconf` facts, seem necessary to move things. But if the only thing I can do is a base movement that *doesn't* change my base position, well, I'm stuck.
           
           I checked again. The rule is absolute:  "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." The problem clearly defines that `move_base` is the only permissible action instance. Therefore, since I *need* `pick` and `place` actions to move the objects and I don't have them, the goal, getting the objects onto `v20`, is utterly unreachable with the provided action instances. It's a fundamental conflict between the required actions for the task and the limitations placed on the actions available to me.
