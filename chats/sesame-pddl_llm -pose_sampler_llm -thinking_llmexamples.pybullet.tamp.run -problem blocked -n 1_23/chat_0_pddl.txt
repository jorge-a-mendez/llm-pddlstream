           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Stable Object Placement - Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to generate 50 stable placements for a small square object (ID 5, side = 0.07) on surface 0, an AABB defined by ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  A stable placement requires the object to be fully contained within the surface boundaries and not collide with any existing objects or obstacles (none are specified at this stage).
           
           I started by calculating the available space on surface 0. Its dimensions are 0.6 x 0.6. Since the object's dimensions (0.07 x 0.07) are relatively small, it can be placed multiple times.  The rotation of the object, *theta*, significantly impacts the available placement area. I determined that the effective size of the square object changes based on its rotation, ranging from a minimum side length of 0.07 (at angles of 0, pi/2, pi, 3*pi/2) to a maximum of approximately 0.099 (at angles of pi/4, 3*pi/4, etc.).
           
           For the majority of placements (49 out of 50), I decided to use a 7x7 grid with zero rotation. This allows for a good distribution of objects across the surface with x and y steps of 0.53/6 to maintain non-overlapping placements. The x range is [4.235, 4.765] and the y range is [-0.565, -0.035].
           
           For the final placement (the 50th), to introduce variety and test the concept's stability over rotation, I chose a rotation of pi/4 radians. For this object I place it at the center of the surface, at x = 4.5 and y = -0.3.
           
           I've carefully calculated the precise coordinates based on the valid ranges to ensure all 50 placements are fully contained within surface 0. The output will be a list of 50 tuples, each containing the surface index, *theta* (rotation in radians), *x*, and *y* coordinates, ready for validation.
