User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.464, 1.138), (-1.324, 1.278)).
           Object v4 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.502, -1.788), (-0.413, -1.699)).
           Object v1 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.163, 0.006), (1.259, 0.101)).
           Object v7 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.582, 0.968), (-0.465, 1.086)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571)).
           Object v3 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-2.126, 0.203), (-2.05, 0.279)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.821, -1.929), (1.187, -1.571)).

           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.491, 1.974), (-0.414, 2.051)).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.524, 2.147), (0.605, 2.228)).
           Object v9 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
           Object v15 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires several conditions to be met, specifically:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` or `atconf(v14, v15)`: Both are initially true.
           - `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: Both are initially true.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This means images of objectives v17 and v18 must be taken and sent.
           - `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means a rock of type `v2` must be sampled and its analysis sent. Rocks `v1`, `v3`, `v4` are of type `v2`.
           - `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means a rock of type `v6` must be sampled and its analysis sent. Rocks `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are of type `v6`.
           
           Rover `v12` is at `v13` and rover `v14` is at `v15`. Both have `v10` as a camera which supports mode `v11`. Both have `v16` as a store.
           
           We need to:
           1. Take images of `v17` and `v18` with `v10` and send them.
           2. Sample and analyze a rock of type `v2` (e.g., `v1`).
           3. Sample and analyze a rock of type `v6` (e.g., `v5`).
           4. Send the analyses of these rocks.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           - We need to `calibrate` the camera `v10` for `v17` and `v18`, then `take_image` and `send_image`.
           - Rover `v14` at configuration `#o3` can see both `v17` and `v18`. Rover `v12` at configuration `#o3` can also see `v17` and `v18`.
           - Both `v12` and `v14` have `v10` as onboard camera.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`:
           - We need to `sample_rock` for `v1` (type `v2`) and `v5` (type `v6`).
           - Both `v12` and `v14` can be above all rocks at configuration `#o5`.
           - We need to move to `#o5`, `sample_rock`, and then move to a configuration visible to `v9` (e.g., `#o0`) to `send_analysis`.
           
           Let's use rover `v14` for image tasks and `v12` for sampling.
           
           For images (using `v14`):
           - `v14` is at `v15`. It needs to move to `#o3` to take images of `v17` and `v18`.
           - `calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10`
           - `take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11`
           - `calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10`
           - `take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11`
           - Then move to `#o0` to send images.
           - `send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11`
           - `send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11`
           
           For analysis (using `v12`):
           - `v12` is at `v13`. It needs to move to `#o5` to sample rocks.
           - `sample_rock v12 #o5 v1 v16` (type v2)
           - `sample_rock v12 #o5 v5 v16` (type v6)
           - Then move to `#o0` to send analyses.
           - `send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v1`
           - `send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v5`
           
           The plan looks achievable. We will coordinate the movements and actions. Rover `v14` handles images, rover `v12` handles samples.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires fulfilling several sub-goals:
           1.  `atconf(v12, v13)` or `atconf(v14, v15)`: Both are initially true.
           2.  `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: Both are initially true.
           3.  `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This means images of objectives `v17` and `v18` must be taken and sent.
           4.  `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means a rock of type `v2` must be sampled and its analysis sent. Rocks `v1`, `v3`, `v4` are of type `v2`.
           5.  `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means a rock of type `v6` must be sampled and its analysis sent. Rocks `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are of type `v6`.
           
           We have two rovers: `v12` at `v13` and `v14` at `v15`. Both have camera `v10` onboard and support mode `v11`. Both have store `v16`. Lander `v9` is available for communication.
           
           Let's assign tasks to optimize the plan:
           *   **Rover `v14` (at `v15`) for image collection and transmission:**
               *   It needs to move to a configuration `#o3` where it has `imagevisible` to `v17` and `v18`.
               *   `v17` (AABB: ((0.524, 2.147), (0.605, 2.228))) and `v18` (AABB: ((-0.491, 1.974), (-0.414, 2.051))) are both in the upper part of the environment.
               *   A suitable configuration for `v14` to view `v17` and `v18` would be roughly in the middle, around (0.0, 1.0) or higher. Let's aim for a configuration that can see both. Given the existing `imagevisible` predicates, `#o3` for `v14` with `v17` and `v18` is suitable.
               *   After taking images, it needs to move to a configuration `#o0` where it has `comvisible` to `v9` (AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))).
               *   `v9` is in the bottom-left. `v15` is (-1.0, -1.75). A configuration near `v15` or slightly more to the left would work. The initial `conf(v14, #o0)` suggests `v14` can achieve this.
           
           *   **Rover `v12` (at `v13`) for rock sampling and analysis transmission:**
               *   It needs to move to a configuration `#o5` where it is `above` rocks `v1` (type `v2`, AABB: ((1.163, 0.006), (1.259, 0.101))) and `v5` (type `v6`, AABB: ((-1.464, 1.138), (-1.324, 1.278))).
               *   `v1` is in the middle-right and `v5` is in the middle-left. A single `#o5` configuration cannot be above both due to their positions. However, the problem statement provides `above(v12, #o5, v1)` and `above(v12, #o5, v5)`. This implies that `#o5` is a conceptual "above" state that can be reached from multiple locations or that multiple #o5 values exist, but we are provided one continuous parameter for #o5. Assuming the given actions allow it, we can sample one rock, then move, or stay in one `#o5` location to sample both if possible. If not possible, we'll need to move. Let's assume we can pick an #o5 that works for one, then use the other rover or another #o5. The provided actions show that both `v1` and `v5` can be sampled by `v12` at `#o5`. This implies that either `#o5` allows for both, or the action system abstracts precise positioning. Given the structure, `sample_rock v12 #o5 v1 v16` and `sample_rock v12 #o5 v5 v16` are both valid action instances. So we can use the same `#o5`.
               *   After sampling, it needs to move to a configuration `#o0` for `comvisible` to `v9`.
               *   `v13` is (1.0, -1.75). This is near the bottom-right. `#o0` for `v12` to communicate with `v9` will be similar to `v14`'s `#o0`.
           
           Let's compute approximate values for the continuous parameters:
           *   `#o3` for `v14` (looking at `v17` and `v18`): `v17` is at (0.56, 2.18) and `v18` is at (-0.45, 2.01). A configuration for `v14` that can see both, and considering `v14` starts at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75), could be approximately (0.0, 1.0). Let's use `(0.0, 1.0)` for `#o3`.
           *   `#o0` for `v14` (communicating with `v9`): `v9` is at approx (-1.9, -2.0). `v14` starts at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). A configuration for communication could be around (-1.5, -1.8). Let's use `(-1.5, -1.8)` for `#o0`.
           *   `#o5` for `v12` (above `v1` and `v5`): `v1` is at (1.21, 0.05), `v5` is at (-1.39, 1.20). These are quite far apart. The problem implies one `#o5` works for both, so let's pick a neutral point that is reachable. Since the `above` predicate is given for both, we will use a single #o5 value. To sample rocks, the rover needs to be above them. Let's take the midpoint between the two extreme rock locations to give a single valid configuration for `#o5` if possible, otherwise we rely on the system to provide it. Given the `above` predicate, the values of `v1` and `v5` are (1.211, 0.053) and (-1.394, 1.208) respectively. The rover needs to be "above" which means close to them. The `conf` parameter is likely a pose for the robot base. Let's make one `#o5` for `v1` and one for `v5`. Since the plan shows `sample_rock v12 #o5 v1 v16` and `sample_rock v12 #o5 v5 v16` using the *same* `#o5` object, this implies either `v12` will move to two different specific poses, but both are represented by `#o5` with continuous values, or a single `#o5` pose can be "above" multiple rocks. Given this ambiguity, and the requirement to define one value for each `#<name>` object, I will define a single `#o5` value. The AABBs of `v1` and `v5` are quite separated. This suggests that the robot might have enough reach or the "above" definition is flexible. A more robust solution might require two different `#o5` configurations, but the provided action instances force a single `#o5` object. Let's pick a configuration relatively close to `v1` (since `v12` starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75), which is closer to `v1`). Let's use (1.0, 0.1) for `#o5`.
           *   `#o0` for `v12` (communicating with `v9`): Similar to `v14`'s `#o0`, let's use `(-1.5, -1.8)`.
           
           It's critical that the chosen continuous parameters allow the actions to be collision-free and executable.

           2.  `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: Both are initially true.
           3.  `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This means images of objectives `v17` and `v18` must be taken and sent.
           4.  `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means a rock of type `v2` must be sampled and its analysis sent. Rocks `v1`, `v3`, `v4` are of type `v2`.
           5.  `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means a rock of type `v6` must be sampled and its analysis sent. Rocks `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are of type `v6`.
           
           We have two rovers: `v12` at `v13` and `v14` at `v15`. Both have camera `v10` onboard and support mode `v11`. Both have store `v16`. Lander `v9` is available for communication.
           
           Let's assign tasks to optimize the plan:
           *   **Rover `v14` (at `v15`) for image collection and transmission:**
               *   It needs to move to a configuration `#o3` where it has `imagevisible` to `v17` and `v18`.
               *   `v17` (AABB: ((0.524, 2.147), (0.605, 2.228))) and `v18` (AABB: ((-0.491, 1.974), (-0.414, 2.051))) are both in the upper part of the environment. A configuration around `(0.0, 1.0)` seems reasonable for viewing both `v17` and `v18` from `v14` given its initial position `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). The maximum distance for `imagevisible` is 2. This position is roughly within 2 units of both targets.
               *   After taking images, it needs to move to a configuration `#o0` where it has `comvisible` to `v9` (AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))).
               *   `v9` is in the bottom-left. `v15` is (-1.0, -1.75). A configuration near `v15` or slightly more to the left would work. Let's choose `(-1.5, -1.8)` which is near `v15` and also `v9`. The maximum distance for `comvisible` is 4. This is within range.
           
           *   **Rover `v12` (at `v13`) for rock sampling and analysis transmission:**
               *   It needs to move to a configuration `#o5` where it is `above` rocks `v1` (type `v2`, AABB: ((1.163, 0.006), (1.259, 0.101))) and `v5` (type `v6`, AABB: ((-1.464, 1.138), (-1.324, 1.278))).
               *   The `above` predicate is given for both `v1` and `v5` with the same `#o5` object. This implies that the chosen `#o5` pose allows the robot to be positioned for sampling both or the system handles intermediate movements not specified in PDDL. Given the locations of `v1` and `v5` are quite far apart, a single physical pose cannot be "above" both simultaneously. However, the problem specifies the use of the provided action instances and a single `#o5` parameter. We will interpret `#o5` as a generic "sampling configuration" that the rover can achieve for sampling tasks. To provide a concrete value for `#o5` (assuming it's a specific pose) that is reachable from `v12`'s `v13` (1.0, -1.75), let's choose a point that is relatively close to one of the rocks, e.g., `v1` (1.21, 0.05). A configuration like `(1.0, 0.1)` would be plausible for being "above" `v1`. We have to assume this single `#o5` satisfies the `above` predicate for both given rocks implicitly through the action instances.
               *   After sampling, it needs to move to a configuration `#o0` for `comvisible` to `v9`.
               *   `v13` is (1.0, -1.75). A communication configuration similar to `v14`'s `#o0` at `(-1.5, -1.8)` would be suitable and reachable.

               *   We need to move `v14` away from `x=0`. Since `v17` is at positive x and `v18` is at negative x, it's difficult for a single point to have an occlusion-free view of both if `v19` is obstructing.
               *   Let's check the given `imagevisible` predicates. Both `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` exist. This implies that there *is* a single configuration `#o3` for `v14` that can see both `v17` and `v18`. Given `v19` at x=0, `#o3` must be at either `x > 0.05` or `x < -0.05`. Let's try `x = 0.2` and `y = 1.0` (still keeping it high to view the objectives). Let's use `(0.2, 1.0)`. This is outside the wall `v19` and within 2m of both `v17` and `v18`.
           
           *   **`#o0` for `v14` (communicating with `v9`)**:
               *   Target: `v9` (AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))).
               *   Previous `#o0` (-1.5, -1.8) collided with `v9` itself. The robot cannot be *inside* the lander.
               *   `v9` is at x between -2.4 and -1.3, y between -2.3 and -1.6.
               *   `v14` starts at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
               *   We need `comvisible` (max dist 4m). We need to be close to `v9` but outside its bounding box.
               *   Let's try a point just outside the `x` range of `v9` on the right, or just outside the `y` range above or below. Since `v14` is coming from x=0.2 (from `#o3`), it makes sense to choose a spot on the "right" or "top" of `v9` that is reachable. Let's try `(-1.0, -1.5)`. This is outside the AABB of `v9` and still close enough.
           
           *   **`#o5` for `v12` (above `v1` and `v5`)**:
               *   Targets: `v1` (AABB: ((1.163, 0.006), (1.259, 0.101))), `v5` (AABB: ((-1.464, 1.138), (-1.324, 1.278))).
               *   Previous `#o5` (1.0, 0.1) was not reported in collision. This seems fine. The `v19` wall is at x=0, so (1.0, 0.1) is not in collision.
               *   Given the action instances, `sample_rock v12 #o5 v1 v16` and `sample_rock v12 #o5 v5 v16` are both available, implying that the rover can achieve a configuration represented by `#o5` for both rocks. As discussed previously, a single physical pose cannot be above both. The continuous value provided is a *specific pose* for the rover that enables sampling of *one* rock, and the system likely handles repositioning or the abstract nature of `#o5`. Since (1.0, 0.1) is close to `v1`, it works for `v1`. Let's keep it.
           
           *   **`#o0` for `v12` (communicating with `v9`)**:
               *   Target: `v9`.
               *   Previous `#o0` (-1.5, -1.8) collided with `v9`. Similar to `v14`, let's use `(-1.0, -1.5)`. `v12` starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75), so moving to `(-1.0, -1.5)` is reachable.
           
           Let's re-check all configurations with the new values against `v19` and `v9`.
           *   `#o3` (0.2, 1.0):
               *   Not in collision with `v19` (x=0.2 > 0.05).
               *   Not in collision with `v9` (y=1.0 is far from v9).
               *   Within 2m of `v17` (0.56, 2.18): sqrt((0.56-0.2)^2 + (2.18-1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.36^2 + 1.18^2) = sqrt(0.1296 + 1.3924) = sqrt(1.522) approx 1.23 < 2.
               *   Within 2m of `v18` (-0.45, 2.01): sqrt((-0.45-0.2)^2 + (2.01-1.0)^2) = sqrt((-0.65)^2 + 1.01^2) = sqrt(0.4225 + 1.0201) = sqrt(1.4426) approx 1.2 < 2.
               *   This `#o3` looks good.
           
           *   `#o0` (-1.0, -1.5):
               *   Not in collision with `v19` (x=-1.0 < -0.05).
               *   Not in collision with `v9` (x=-1.0 > -1.395, y=-1.5 > -1.654). It is slightly above and to the right of `v9`'s bounding box.
               *   Within 4m of `v9` (-1.9, -2.0): sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.0))^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.5))^2) = sqrt((-0.9)^2 + (-0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 0.25) = sqrt(1.06) approx 1.03 < 4.
               *   This `#o0` looks good for both rovers.
           
           *   `#o5` (1.0, 0.1):
               *   Not in collision with `v19` (x=1.0 > 0.05).
               *   Not in collision with `v9` (y=0.1 is far from v9).
               *   This `#o5` remains valid as it was not in collision.
           
           This revised set of configurations should be collision-free and allow the operations.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The previous plan failed due to persistent collision issues with obstacles and reachability problems. Let's analyze the new collision reports and adjust configurations carefully.
           
           **New Obstacles/Issues:**
           *   `v19`: AABB ((-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), (0.05, 2.5, 0.1)) - Still causing collision for `#o3` at (0.2, 1.0). This means the rover itself must be considered when checking collisions, not just its center. If the rover has a width/radius, (0.2, 1.0) might still be too close to x=0.
           *   `v20`: AABB ((-1.055, -1.498, 0.001), (-0.916, -1.359, 0.401)) - This is a new obstacle, and `#o0` at (-1.0, -1.5) collides with it. This obstacle is very close to `v14`'s initial position `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). It's also in the communication path to `v9`.
           *   `#o5` (1.0, 0.1) for `v12` is not reachable. `v12` starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). The target (1.0, 0.1) is vertically away from `v13` but at the same x. This indicates there might be an obstacle between `y=-1.75` and `y=0.1` at `x=1.0`, or the rover has limits on vertical movement for "reaching" specific points.
           
           **Revised Strategy for Configurations:**
           
           *   **`#o3` for `v14` (looking at `v17` and `v18`)**:
               *   Targets: `v17` (AABB: ((0.524, 2.147), (0.605, 2.228))), `v18` (AABB: ((-0.491, 1.974), (-0.414, 2.051))).
               *   `v19` is at x=0. Let's try to place `v14` further out from x=0 to avoid `v19`.
               *   Since `v17` is in positive x and `v18` in negative x, placing the rover sufficiently to one side (e.g., positive x) might occlude the other target. However, the problem states `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` both exist. This implies a single `#o3` *can* see both.
               *   Let's try a position with `x` well outside `v19`, for example, `x = 0.5`. And keep `y = 1.0`. So, `(0.5, 1.0)`. This should clear `v19`. It's also plausible that the rover is small enough that (0.2, 1.0) *should* have worked, but let's be more conservative.
               *   Check visibility:
                   *   To `v17` (0.56, 2.18): dist = sqrt((0.56-0.5)^2 + (2.18-1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.06^2 + 1.18^2) = sqrt(0.0036 + 1.3924) = sqrt(1.396) approx 1.18 < 2.
                   *   To `v18` (-0.45, 2.01): dist = sqrt((-0.45-0.5)^2 + (2.01-1.0)^2) = sqrt((-0.95)^2 + 1.01^2) = sqrt(0.9025 + 1.0201) = sqrt(1.9226) approx 1.39 < 2.
               *   This `#o3` (0.5, 1.0) looks promising.
           
           *   **`#o0` for `v14` (communicating with `v9`)**:
               *   Target: `v9` (AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))).
               *   `v20` (AABB: ((-1.055, -1.498), (-0.916, -1.359))) collides with previous `#o0` (-1.0, -1.5).
               *   `v14` starts at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). `v20` is an obstacle very close to `v15`.
               *   We need `comvisible` (max dist 4m) to `v9` and avoid `v20`.
               *   `v9` is further left and down. `v20` is just above `v15`.
               *   Let's try to move `v14` further away from `v20` and `v9` but still within communication range.
               *   Let's try `(-0.5, -2.0)`. This is further right of `v9`'s x-range, and below `v20`'s y-range.
               *   Check collision:
                   *   `(-0.5, -2.0)` is not in `v19` (x=0).
                   *   `(-0.5, -2.0)` is not in `v9` or `v20` bounding boxes.
                   *   Check distance to `v9` (-1.9, -2.0): dist = sqrt((-1.9 - (-0.5))^2 + (-2.0 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt((-1.4)^2 + 0^2) = 1.4 < 4.
               *   This `#o0` (-0.5, -2.0) seems better.
           
           *   **`#o5` for `v12` (above `v1` and `v5`)**:
               *   Targets: `v1` (AABB: ((1.163, 0.006), (1.259, 0.101))), `v5` (AABB: ((-1.464, 1.138), (-1.324, 1.278))).
               *   `v12` starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
               *   Previous `#o5` (1.0, 0.1) was not reachable. This likely means there's an obstacle on the path from (1.0, -1.75) to (1.0, 0.1) or the y-movement is restricted. The obstacles are `v19` (at x=0) and `v20` (around x=-1.0). Neither are at `x=1.0`.
               *   Let's consider `v1` (1.21, 0.05). If `v12` is to be `above` it, `(1.21, 0.05)` is a candidate. This is very close to the rock itself. Let's try a point close but slightly offset to allow the robot body. Given `v1` is at `(1.163, 0.006)` to `(1.259, 0.101)`, let's try `(1.2, 0.0)` for `#o5`. This is very close to the rock, which might be why the "above" predicate expects this. This is also outside `v19`. This point is reachable from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) via an arc, without crossing any known obstacles on a straight line path.
               *   The `sample_rock v12 #o5 v5 v16` action still implies that this single `#o5` value works for both `v1` and `v5`. This is a strong assumption, but we must adhere to the provided action instances. So we use a single `#o5` value.
           
           *   **`#o0` for `v12` (communicating with `v9`)**:
               *   Target: `v9`.
               *   Previous `#o0` (-1.0, -1.5) collided with `v20`.
               *   Let's use the same new collision-free point as `v14`: `(-0.5, -2.0)`. This is reachable from `v12`'s current `v13` (1.0, -1.75) and after moving to `#o5` (1.2, 0.0).
           
           Let's summarize the new configurations:
           *   `#o3`: (0.5, 1.0)
           *   `#o0`: (-0.5, -2.0)
           *   `#o5`: (1.2, 0.0)

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     It appears there are severe reachability constraints for both rovers from their initial configurations (`v13` and `v15`). All proposed configurations have been deemed unreachable.
           
           Let's carefully examine the initial positions and the required target locations:
           *   **Rover `v14` starts at `v15` (base config: (-1.0, -1.75))**
           *   **Rover `v12` starts at `v13` (base config: (1.0, -1.75))**
           
           **Goals:**
           *   Take images of `v17` (approx (0.56, 2.18)) and `v18` (approx (-0.45, 2.01)). These are both high up in the 'y' direction.
           *   Sample `v1` (approx (1.21, 0.05)) and `v5` (approx (-1.39, 1.20)). `v1` is in positive x, `v5` in negative x, both in positive y relative to rover starting positions.
           *   Communicate with `v9` (AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))). This is in the bottom-left.
           
           **Obstacles:**
           *   `v19`: AABB ((-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), (0.05, 2.5, 0.1)) - A wall at x=0.
           *   `v20`: AABB ((-1.055, -1.498, 0.001), (-0.916, -1.359, 0.401)) - An obstacle near `v14`'s starting `v15`.
           
           **Reachability Analysis:**
           Given that all previous attempts to define `#o3`, `#o5`, and `#o0` have resulted in "not reachable for robot base," this suggests that the rovers are extremely restricted in their movement range, or the intermediate path planner is very sensitive to obstacles.
           
           Let's assume the rovers have a very limited movement radius around their starting positions, or there are unstated large obstacles restricting movement significantly. If a configuration is "not reachable", it might be that a straight line path to it is blocked, or it's simply too far from the current configuration for a single motion primitive.
           
           However, the problem states `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o5)` and `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o3)` etc. This implies that *some* motion exists to these conceptual `#<name>` configurations. The issue is in *defining the continuous value* for `#<name>` that is actually reachable and collision-free.
           
           Considering the extreme difficulty, let's pick configurations that are *extremely close* to the initial positions, hoping they are "reachable" and then try to work from there. This might mean we cannot achieve all goals if the required targets are too far.
           
           Let's try to assign tasks based on proximity to initial positions:
           
           *   **Rover `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)**:
               *   **Images (`v17`, `v18`)**: `v17` (0.56, 2.18), `v18` (-0.45, 2.01). These are very far from `v14`'s start point. It's highly unlikely any configuration close to `v15` will have `imagevisible` to these targets. The furthest `v14` can go while staying "close" might be a meter or so. A configuration like `(-0.9, 0.0)` is still far from the targets. Given the repeated "not reachable" errors, trying to reach high-y targets seems problematic.
               *   **Communication (`v9`)**: `v9` is ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). `v15` is (-1.0, -1.75). The obstacle `v20` ((-1.055, -1.498), (-0.916, -1.359)) is in the way.
                   *   To avoid `v20` and be near `v9`, `v14` would need to move `x` to the left (e.g., -1.5) and `y` slightly down (e.g., -2.0) or up (e.g., -1.5). `(-1.5, -2.0)` avoids `v20` and `v9`. This is within 4m of `v9`. Let's try `(-1.5, -2.0)` for `#o0`. This is a relatively small movement from `v15`.
           
           *   **Rover `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75)**:
               *   **Sampling (`v1`, `v5`)**: `v1` (1.21, 0.05), `v5` (-1.39, 1.20). `v13` is (1.0, -1.75). `v1` is relatively close in x, but far in y.
                   *   To be "above" `v1`, let's try a configuration very close to `v13` but shifted slightly. `(1.0, -1.0)` is closer to `v1` in y, but still might not be "above". Let's try `(1.1, -0.5)` as `#o5`. This is moving towards `v1`. `v1`'s AABB is ((1.163, 0.006), (1.259, 0.101)). Being at `(1.1, -0.5)` is still not "above" by simple y-coordinate comparison.
                   *   This repeated "not reachable" for `#o5` might mean there are *no* reachable points that satisfy `above`. If `(1.0, 0.1)` was unreachable from `(1.0, -1.75)`, it suggests there's some severe restriction on y-movement or obstacles at `x=1.0`.
           
           **Re-evaluating the Goal based on continuous parameters:**
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires:
           *   `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           *   `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (type `v2`: `v1`, `v3`, `v4`)
           *   `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (type `v6`: `v5`, `v7`, `v8`)
           
           If the rovers cannot reach configurations that can see `v17`/`v18` or be above the rocks, then the goal is genuinely unreachable. The current setup seems to indicate this. The continuous parameters are failing even for small movements.
           
           Let's reconsider the reachability from `v15` and `v13`. These are "base configurations," implying they are current fixed locations. The `motion` predicates show that there *are* paths between the base configurations and the `#o<id>` configurations. For example, `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o3)` implies a path from `v15` to `#o3`. The problem is finding *a specific valid coordinate* for `#o3` and ensuring the path itself is not blocked.
           
           Given the consistent failure of reachability, it's possible the environment is far more constrained than a simple AABB check implies, or the rover's movement envelope is very small.
           
           Let's assume the "reachability" check is very strict and maybe includes collision with the rover's body itself, or complex path planning.
           A strategy to maximize reachability is to choose configurations that are minimal deviations from the starting points, then verify if they satisfy the predicates.
           
           For `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75):
           *   To view `v17` (0.56, 2.18) and `v18` (-0.45, 2.01): The problem explicitly provides `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`. This means such a `#o3` must exist. Perhaps a `y` value closer to the rover's `y` coordinate for `v15` (i.e. -1.75) is better to stay reachable. But `v17/v18` are high up. This is a fundamental conflict. If we *must* use `imagevisible` actions, and they specify `#o3`, then there *must* be a reachable `#o3`.
               *   Let's try a very modest move. `v14` is at `x=-1.0`. If we move to `x=0.0` or `x=0.1` or `x=0.2` (just clearing `v19` at x=0), the Y-values of `v17` and `v18` are 2+. This seems too far for `imagevisible`.
               *   The only option that allows using the provided `imagevisible` predicates is that there exist valid coordinates for `#o3` *despite* their apparent distance/collision issues. The planner should be able to find these if they exist.
               *   Let's try a `#o3` with `x=0.1` to clear `v19` and a `y` that is still somewhat high. E.g., `(0.1, 0.5)`. This is not really 'above' `v17/v18` from a simple y-perspective. But `imagevisible` is about line-of-sight. This is a very complex situation.
           
           Given the extreme difficulty of finding collision-free, reachable, and sight-line-valid continuous values, it implies the problem is either set up to be extremely difficult, or I am misinterpreting the "reachable" criteria or the role of `#o<id>` configurations. Since I cannot create a plan that meets the continuous value requirements for reachability, and given multiple attempts, it strongly suggests the goal might be unreachable given the provided constraints on continuous parameters.
           
           However, I must assume there is a plan. Let's reconsider the closest feasible locations for each continuous parameter, trying to stay as close as possible to the start or known object to ensure reachability.
           
           **Rover `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)**:
           *   **Images (`v17`, `v18`)**:
               *   To satisfy `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`, and clear `v19` (wall at x=0) and be reachable from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
               *   Targets `v17` (0.56, 2.18), `v18` (-0.45, 2.01).
               *   Let's place `v14` slightly to the right of `v19`, and higher than `v15`, but not too high to remain reachable. Perhaps `(0.1, 0.0)`. This point is:
                   *   Outside `v19`.
                   *   Reachable from `v15`? Distance approx sqrt((-1.0-0.1)^2 + (-1.75-0.0)^2) = sqrt(1.21 + 3.06) approx 2.06. This might be considered reachable.
                   *   Visibility: Check distance to `v17` (0.56, 2.18): sqrt((0.56-0.1)^2 + (2.18-0.0)^2) = sqrt(0.46^2 + 2.18^2) = sqrt(0.21 + 4.75) = sqrt(4.96) approx 2.22. This is over 2m, violating `imagerange`.
               *   This implies the `imagerange` is the actual constraint, not just `imagevisible` and `conf`. The continuous configuration value must be within 2m of the target. This makes reaching high-y targets from low-y starting points very hard.
           
           This suggests that the goals related to `v17` and `v18` might be unreachable with the existing `imagerange` constraints if the rover's starting points are restricted to low Y values and cannot move far. The only way to succeed is if a configuration *exists* that satisfies all constraints (reachable, collision-free, in range, occlusion-free). Since none of my attempts have worked, it is possible the goal is unreachable given the current scene geometry and rover capabilities.
           
           However, the problem statement explicitly requests me to provide a plan or explain *why the goal is not achievable*. I must try to provide a plan. The repeated "not reachable" errors are the most significant challenge. This indicates that moving *away* from the starting coordinates is difficult.
           
           Let's try to choose configurations that are *extremely close* to the rover's starting positions. If `v14` is at `v15`(-1.0, -1.75), maybe `#o3` can be `(-0.9, -1.6)`. This is a small movement, hence "reachable". But it won't see `v17` or `v18`. This leads to the conclusion that the goal is likely unreachable if strict reachability is combined with `imagerange` and target locations.
           
           Given the constraints, I will make one last attempt, focusing on slightly perturbing the start poses for reachability, and checking collision. The `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates with `#o<id>` parameters are the key.
           
           **Rover `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)**:
           *   **Images (`v17`, `v18`)**:
               *   `v17` (0.56, 2.18), `v18` (-0.45, 2.01).
               *   Collision with `v19` at x=0 needs `#o3` to be at `x > 0.05` or `x < -0.05`.
               *   `imagerange` (2m) implies `v14` needs to be relatively close to the targets.
               *   To view both `v17` and `v18`, `v14` needs to be in a high `y` position, and between their `x` values for best occlusion.
               *   Let's try to find an `x` that clears `v19` AND `y` such that it's in range of `v17` or `v18`.
               *   If `v14` moves to `x=-0.2`, `y=1.5`. (dist to `v18`: sqrt((-0.45 - (-0.2))^2 + (2.01-1.5)^2) = sqrt(0.0625 + 0.26) approx 0.57 < 2). This position would clear `v19`.
               *   Let's try `#o3` at `(-0.2, 1.5)`. This is a significant move from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
                   *   Dist from `v15` to `(-0.2, 1.5)`: sqrt((-0.2 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.5 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.8^2 + 3.25^2) = sqrt(0.64 + 10.56) = sqrt(11.2) approx 3.3. This might be too far to be "reachable" by a single motion step.
           
           *   **Communication (`v9`)**:
               *   `v9` (AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))).
               *   `v20` (AABB: ((-1.055, -1.498), (-0.916, -1.359))) is an obstacle.
               *   `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
               *   Let's try `(-1.5, -2.0)`. This should clear `v20` and `v9` and is within range. It's a small movement.
                   *   Distance from `v15` to `(-1.5, -2.0)`: sqrt((-1.5 - (-1.0))^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-0.5)^2 + (-0.25)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.0625) = sqrt(0.3125) approx 0.56. This is a very small, likely reachable movement.
           
           **Rover `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75)**:
           *   **Sampling (`v1`, `v5`)**:
               *   `v1` (AABB: ((1.163, 0.006), (1.259, 0.101))), `v5` (AABB: ((-1.464, 1.138), (-1.324, 1.278))).
               *   The `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o5)` exists.
               *   Let's try to be "above" `v1`. The coordinates of `v1` are around (1.2, 0.05). Let's define `#o5` as `(1.2, 0.0)`.
                   *   Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `(1.2, 0.0)`: sqrt((1.2-1.0)^2 + (0.0 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.2^2 + 1.75^2) = sqrt(0.04 + 3.0625) = sqrt(3.1025) approx 1.76. This is a moderate distance, possibly reachable. It cleared `v19`.
           
           *   **Communication (`v9`)**:
               *   Using the same logic as `v14`, `(-1.5, -2.0)` for `#o0`.
                   *   Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `(-1.5, -2.0)`: sqrt((-1.5 - 1.0)^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-2.5)^2 + (-0.25)^2) = sqrt(6.25 + 0.0625) = sqrt(6.3125) approx 2.5. This is further, but might be reachable by `v12`.
           
           This is the most plausible configuration given the very strict reachability messages. If this fails, then there's an inherent unreachability or a very complex interpretation of the scene.

Model:     This problem is proving to be exceptionally challenging due to persistent collision and reachability issues with all proposed continuous configurations. It seems the environment geometry, combined with the rover's physical dimensions and movement constraints, creates very few (if any) valid poses.
           
           Let's re-examine the collision reports and try to derive a new set of configurations, being even more precise and conservative with the geometry.
           
           **Obstacles Recap:**
           *   `v19` (Wall at x=0): AABB ((-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), (0.05, 2.5, 0.1)). This wall has a thickness from -0.05 to 0.05. A rover at `x=-0.2` or `x=0.2` should clear it, assuming the rover's own width is less than 0.1 (the distance from the wall to the center of the rover). The consistent collision with `v19` for `x=-0.2` implies the rover is wider than 0.1, or `x=-0.2` is still considered "too close" due to its full body. If the rover's width is, say, 0.4, then its center must be at least 0.2 away from `x=0.05` or `x=-0.05`. So, `x > 0.25` or `x < -0.25`.
           *   `v9` (Lander/Communication target): AABB ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). Previous attempts to place `#o0` at `(-1.5, -2.0)` resulted in collision with `v9` itself. This means the rover's body is intersecting `v9`. The rover needs to be *outside* the lander's bounding box to communicate.
           *   `v20`: AABB ((-1.055, -1.498, 0.001), (-0.916, -1.359, 0.401)). This obstacle is very close to `v14`'s initial position `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). It sits roughly at `x=-1.0`, `y=-1.4`.
           
           **Initial Rover Positions:**
           *   `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)
           *   `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75)
           
           **Revised Configuration Strategy:**
           
           *   **`#o3` for `v14` (for images of `v17` and `v18`)**:
               *   Targets: `v17` (0.56, 2.18), `v18` (-0.45, 2.01).
               *   To clear `v19` (wall at x=0) and assume a wider rover: Let's pick `x=0.3`.
               *   `imagerange` is 2m. This implies `y` needs to be relatively high. Let's try `y=1.0`. This is far from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75), but it's a trade-off between range and reachability.
               *   Check distance from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `(0.3, 1.0)`: sqrt((0.3 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.0 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(1.3^2 + 2.75^2) = sqrt(1.69 + 7.5625) = sqrt(9.2525) approx 3.04. This is a significant move. Hopefully, this is "reachable".
               *   Check collision with `v19`: `x=0.3` is greater than `0.05`, so it should clear the wall.
               *   Check image range:
                   *   To `v17` (0.56, 2.18): sqrt((0.56-0.3)^2 + (2.18-1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.26^2 + 1.18^2) = sqrt(0.0676 + 1.3924) = sqrt(1.46) approx 1.21 < 2.
                   *   To `v18` (-0.45, 2.01): sqrt((-0.45-0.3)^2 + (2.01-1.0)^2) = sqrt((-0.75)^2 + 1.01^2) = sqrt(0.5625 + 1.0201) = sqrt(1.5826) approx 1.26 < 2.
               *   This `#o3` (0.3, 1.0) seems to satisfy range and clear `v19`.
           
           *   **`#o0` for `v14` (for communication with `v9`)**:
               *   Target `v9` ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
               *   Obstacle `v20` ((-1.055, -1.498), (-0.916, -1.359)).
               *   Previous `(-1.5, -2.0)` collided with `v9`. We need to be *outside* `v9`.
               *   `v9`'s x-range is -2.4 to -1.39. Its y-range is -2.34 to -1.65.
               *   `v20`'s x-range is -1.05 to -0.91. Its y-range is -1.49 to -1.35.
               *   Let's place `#o0` to the right and slightly above `v9` (to avoid `v20` too).
               *   How about `(-1.2, -1.5)`?
                   *   Clear `v9`? `x=-1.2` is within `v9`'s x-range (-2.4 to -1.39), so this is still a collision.
               *   Let's try *well outside* `v9`. To the right and above: `(-1.0, -1.3)`.
                   *   Clear `v9`? `x=-1.0` is greater than `v9`'s max x of -1.39. `y=-1.3` is greater than `v9`'s max y of -1.65. This looks clear.
                   *   Clear `v20`? `x=-1.0` is within `v20`'s x-range (-1.05 to -0.91). `y=-1.3` is above `v20`'s y-range (-1.49 to -1.35). This still might be a collision or too close.
               *   Let's try above and to the far right of both `v9` and `v20`. `(-0.8, -1.2)`.
                   *   `x=-0.8` is clear of `v9` (max x -1.39) and `v20` (max x -0.91).
                   *   `y=-1.2` is clear of `v9` (max y -1.65) and `v20` (max y -1.35).
                   *   Distance to `v9` (approx -1.9, -2.0 from center of bounding box): sqrt((-1.9 - (-0.8))^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.2))^2) = sqrt((-1.1)^2 + (-0.8)^2) = sqrt(1.21 + 0.64) = sqrt(1.85) approx 1.36 < 4.
               *   This `#o0` (`-0.8, -1.2`) looks good for `v14`.
           
           *   **`#o5` for `v12` (for sampling `v1` and `v5`)**:
               *   `v12` starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
               *   Targets: `v1` (1.21, 0.05), `v5` (-1.39, 1.20).
               *   The problem is `(1.2, 0.0)` was "not reachable." This is a moderate vertical move.
               *   Let's assume the rover cannot move far vertically, but can move horizontally. This might imply the obstacles `v19` or other unseen terrain features prevent large y-changes.
               *   Perhaps `above` implies being vertically aligned, and the rover can extend an arm. If the robot base cannot move much vertically, then being "above" `v1` (y=0.05) from `v13` (y=-1.75) is the issue.
               *   If the goal is truly reachable, there must be a configuration `#o5` that is reachable. Since `v1` is at `x=1.2`, and `v12` starts at `x=1.0`, moving horizontally to `x=1.2` seems fine.
               *   What if `#o5` must be at a similar `y` level as `v13`? E.g., `(1.2, -1.7)`. This is clearly not `above` `v1` (y=0.05).
               *   This is the most critical block. If `v12` cannot reach any point 'above' the rocks, then sampling is impossible. The previous "not reachable" for (1.2, 0.0) is very strong.
               *   Given no specific information on the reachability problem, I must consider the possibility that it's impossible for `v12` to reach "above" the rocks specified for sampling. This could make the entire goal unreachable.
               *   However, let's try a very small perturbation from `v13`. Say, `(1.0, -1.7)`. This is unlikely to be "above" `v1`. The problem assumes `above(v12, #o5, v1)` exists for some `#o5`.
               *   If `(1.2, 0.0)` is not reachable, then any significant vertical motion for `v12` appears to be restricted. This means `sample_rock` may be unachievable for `v1` and `v5`.
               *   Let's try to infer from the *lack* of collision reports for `v12` and `v13` that the area around `x=1.0` is generally clear, but reaching `y=0.0` from `y=-1.75` is hard.
           
           *   **`#o0` for `v12` (for communication with `v9`)**:
               *   Using the same logic as `v14`, `(-0.8, -1.2)` for `#o0`.
                   *   Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `(-0.8, -1.2)`: sqrt((-0.8 - 1.0)^2 + (-1.2 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-1.8)^2 + 0.55^2) = sqrt(3.24 + 0.3025) = sqrt(3.5425) approx 1.88. This is also a moderate distance.
           
           Given the extreme difficulty, and multiple failures of "reachability", I must consider that the problem might be designed such that some parts are fundamentally unreachable given the rover's kinematics or environmental constraints not fully revealed by AABBs alone. The `motion` predicates confirm that *some* transition path exists, but actually instantiating the coordinates has proven impossible within the system's evaluation.
           
           However, as per instructions, I must make a plan or state why it's unreachable. If I cannot find a set of working continuous parameters after multiple iterations, it is a strong indication of unreachability.
           
           The critical failures are:
           1.  `#o3` (image conf) repeatedly collides with `v19` despite attempts to clear it, suggesting the rover body is large or the clearance required is significant.
           2.  `#o0` (comms conf) repeatedly collides with `v9` or `v20`, even for small movements, suggesting very tight packing of objects around communication points.
           3.  `#o5` (sampling conf) is consistently "not reachable", especially for `v12`, implying that vertical movement or movement towards the rocks' Y-coordinates is severely restricted.
           
           If `v12` cannot reach `#o5`, then `sample_rock` cannot be performed, and thus `receivedanalysis` for either rock type `v2` or `v6` cannot be achieved. If this is the case, the goal `new-axiom@0()` (which requires `receivedanalysis`) is fundamentally unreachable.
           
           Let's assume there is *some* extremely narrow valid region.
           
           Let's retry `#o3` with an even more conservative `x` value: `(0.4, 1.0)`. This should clear `v19`.
           
           For `#o5` for `v12`, the "not reachable" from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(1.2, 0.0)` is a major problem. Perhaps the rover can only move along a flat plane. If so, sampling rocks that are at higher `y` coordinates would be impossible. If the goal is truly reachable, the `above` predicate must somehow be satisfied. There must be a reachable `y` value that is considered 'above' for sampling. If there's no such `y` value that is reachable and above, the goal is unreachable.
           
           Given the continuous failures on reachability for `#o5` for `v12`, I conclude that the sub-goal of `receivedanalysis` for rocks might be impossible due to environmental constraints. If rover `v12` cannot reach a position "above" any rock, it cannot sample. The `above` predicate for `#o5` and `v1` (y=0.05) cannot be satisfied if `v12` is stuck at `y=-1.75` or similar low values due to reachability limits.
           
           Therefore, I conclude the goal is not achievable.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires `receivedanalysis(?r)` for rocks of type `v2` and `v6`. This can only be achieved by `sample_rock` followed by `send_analysis`. The `sample_rock` action requires the rover to be `above(?v, ?q, ?r)`. For rover `v12`, the target rocks `v1` (y=0.05) and `v5` (y=1.20) are at significantly higher y-coordinates than `v12`'s initial position `v13` (y=-1.75). The system has repeatedly reported that configurations like `(1.2, 0.0)` for `#o5` (intended to be "above" `v1`) are "not reachable for robot base". This indicates that `v12` cannot achieve a pose with a sufficiently high y-coordinate to be considered "above" the rocks for sampling. Without the ability to sample rocks, the `receivedanalysis` condition of the goal cannot be met. Therefore, the goal is not achievable.
