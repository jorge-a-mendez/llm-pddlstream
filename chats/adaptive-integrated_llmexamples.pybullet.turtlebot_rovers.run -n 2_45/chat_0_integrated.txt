           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.464, 1.138), (-1.324, 1.278)).
           Object v4 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.502, -1.788), (-0.413, -1.699)).
           Object v1 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.163, 0.006), (1.259, 0.101)).
           Object v7 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.582, 0.968), (-0.465, 1.086)).

           Object v15 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks to achieve the `new-axiom@0()` goal, which means:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`
           - `free(v12, v16)`
           - `free(v14, v16)`
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for any `?stone` that is a `rock` and has `type` `v2`. From the initial state, rocks of type `v2` are `v1`, `v3`, `v4`.
           - `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for any `?soil` that is a `rock` and has `type` `v6`. From the initial state, rocks of type `v6` are `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           
           Let's break down what needs to be achieved based on the initial state:
           
           Current state:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` is true.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)` is true.
           - `free(v12, v16)` is true.
           - `free(v14, v16)` is true.
           
           What needs to be done:
           1.  **`receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:** This means a rover needs to take images of `v17` and `v18` with mode `v11` and then send them to the lander `v9`.
               *   Rover `v14` has `imagevisible` to `v18` and `v17` at `conf #o3` with ray `#o4`.
               *   Rover `v12` has `imagevisible` to `v18` and `v17` at `conf #o3` with ray `#o4`.
               *   Both rovers `v12` and `v14` have `onboard(v10)` and `supports(v10, v11)`.
               *   Both rovers `v12` and `v14` have `comvisible` to `v9` at `conf #o0` with ray `#o1`.
           
           2.  **`receivedanalysis(?stone)` for rocks of type `v2` (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`):** This means a rover needs to sample these rocks and then send the analysis.
               *   `v14` is `above` `v1`, `v3`, `v4` at `conf #o5`.
               *   `v12` is `above` `v1`, `v3`, `v4` at `conf #o5`.
           
           3.  **`receivedanalysis(?soil)` for rocks of type `v6` (`v5`, `v7`, `v8`):** This means a rover needs to sample these rocks and then send the analysis.
               *   `v14` is `above` `v5`, `v7`, `v8` at `conf #o5`.
               *   `v12` is `above` `v5`, `v7`, `v8` at `conf #o5`.
           
           The available actions are very limited: `move v12 v13 #o2 v13`, `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`, `drop_rock v12 v16`, `drop_rock v14 v16`.
           These actions do not include `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`.
           Since the initial state does not already satisfy all the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates and the available actions do not include any actions to achieve them, the goal is not achievable with the given available actions.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(v1)`, `receivedanalysis(v3)`, `receivedanalysis(v4)`, `receivedanalysis(v5)`, `receivedanalysis(v7)`, and `receivedanalysis(v8)`. None of these can be achieved with the given `move` and `drop_rock` actions. The `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions are necessary but not in the list of available actions.
