User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with dimensions 5x5, centered at (0,0). There are outer walls at x = +/-2.55 and y = +/-2.55, which define the boundaries of the room. There is also a vertical wall (AABB 5) in the middle of the room at x=0, which spans the entire y-axis. There are other small obstacles scattered around the room. I will try to find positions for the robot that are within the max_range of 2 from the target point and avoid these known obstacles. I will prioritize positions that are likely to have a clear line of sight.

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The previous positions collided with the outer walls, so I need to make sure the proposed positions are strictly within the x and y limits of [-2.5, 2.5]. Also, (0.5, 0.5) had no line of sight to the target point, likely due to the central wall (AABB 5) at x=0. Since the target is at (-0.69, 2.18), I need to place the robot on the left side of the x=0 wall. I will look for positions close to the target, keeping in mind the obstacles (AABBs 8, 9, 10, 20) in that quadrant.

Model:     The previous attempts show that positions outside the strict bounds of [-2.5, 2.5] will collide. Also, the x=0 wall (AABB 5) is a major line-of-sight obstruction. The target is (-0.69, 2.18). I will propose positions on the left side of x=0. I will try to stay away from existing obstacles like AABBs 8, 9, 10, 11, and 20. I need to be within 2 units of the target.

Model:     The previous attempts all resulted in no line of sight, likely due to the central wall (AABB 5) at x=0. The target point is now (1.92, 1.93), which is on the right side of the x=0 wall. I need to place the robot on the right side of x=0. I will try to stay away from the walls and obstacles like AABBs 7, 12, 14, 19 in that quadrant.
