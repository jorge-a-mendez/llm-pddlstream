User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.63, 0.357), (-4.531, 0.456)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.581, 0.407, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.925, 0.381).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom type(v8, v17)
           Atom type(v12, v17)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom atbconf(v3)

           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom pose(v15, v16)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v14)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom graspable(v15)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom stackable(v15, v10)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks to achieve the goal `(new-axiom@0)`. This axiom is defined as `(on ?green v18)` and `(type ?green v17)`. Looking at the initial state, we have `(type v8 v17)` and `(type v12 v17)`. So, `?green` can be either `v8` or `v12`.
           
           Let's assume `?green` is `v8`. The goal becomes `(on v8 v18)`.
           The axiom `(on ?o ?r)` is defined as `(supported ?o ?p ?r)` and `(atpose ?o ?p)`.
           So, to achieve `(on v8 v18)`, we need to have `(supported v8 ?p v18)` and `(atpose v8 ?p)`.
           From the initial state, we have `(supported v8 #o2 v18)`. So, we need to achieve `(atpose v8 #o2)`.
           Currently, `(atpose v8 v9)` is true. So, we need to move `v8` from `v9` to `#o2`.
           
           Let's assume `?green` is `v12`. The goal becomes `(on v12 v18)`.
           To achieve `(on v12 v18)`, we need to have `(supported v12 ?p v18)` and `(atpose v12 ?p)`.
           From the initial state, we have `(supported v12 #o2 v18)`. So, we need to achieve `(atpose v12 #o2)`.
           Currently, `(atpose v12 v13)` is true. So, we need to move `v12` from `v13` to `#o2`.
           
           The only available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not allow us to pick and place objects. Since we need to move an object from one pose to another to satisfy the goal, and there are no `pick` or `place` actions available, the goal is not achievable.
