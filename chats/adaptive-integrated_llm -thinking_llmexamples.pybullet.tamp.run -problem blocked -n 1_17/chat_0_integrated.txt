User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.486, -0.069, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.966, -0.257).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.533, -0.117), (-4.438, -0.021)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Goal Reachability**
           
           My primary objective is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a specific type be placed on surface `v18`. After reviewing the axioms and initial state, it's clear that the objects `v8` and `v12` are candidates because they possess the required type.
           
           The core challenge lies in manipulating the `on` predicate. Currently, neither `v8` nor `v12` is situated on `v18`. Both are supported on other surfaces. To achieve the goal, I would need to *pick* and *place* one of these objects.
           
           However, a critical constraint is that only a predefined list of action instances is permitted. Upon examining this list, I find only `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. This significantly limits my options.  Since the necessary `pick` and `place` actions are absent from the permissible actions, I'm stuck.
           
           The only available action, `move_base`, doesn't change `on` predicates and, consequently, cannot contribute to placing an object on `v18`.  It merely moves the base, and does nothing towards the goal.
           
           Therefore, given the constraints on available actions, the goal of `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable. It's fundamentally impossible to manipulate the object's position given the restrictions on permitted actions. The presence of the `move_base` action alone is inadequate to solve the problem.
