           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is to achieve `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which essentially requires capturing images and analyzing rock samples. My first step is always to examine the initial state and, crucially, the preconditions of the required actions to achieve the goal. I immediately see the core issue: the rovers are stuck at their initial configurations (v13 and v15), and the only "movement" action is a no-op, moving them back to the *same* location.
           
           **Analysis of Action Preconditions and Initial State**
           
           Examining the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` conditions, I quickly realize I'll need `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, respectively. But to get those, I'll need `take_image` and `sample_rock`. The issue arises in the preconditions of these crucial actions; they all require that the rover be at a specific configuration, like `#o3`, `#o5` for image and rock operations. However, the initial state gives us `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`, and the available `move` actions simply reinforce those locations, not moving the rovers to these necessary configurations.
           
           **Identifying the Bottleneck: Rover Mobility**
           
           It is clear I'm hitting a wall here. Even the `calibrate` action needed for images has the same issue: a location precondition.  I can see that rovers are imagevisible and comvisible to targets, and can sample rocks if they are above them, but none of these locations are reachable with the available "move" actions.  This lack of movement means I can't even get started to use the rest of the actions. It seems the system is intentionally designed this way.
           
           **Conclusion: Unachievability of the Goal**
           
           Therefore, I've concluded that the given goal is **unachievable** with the provided initial state and actions. There's no way to reach the required configurations to take the images or sample rocks, thus blocking all progress toward the overall goal of getting image and analysis information. The system is missing the necessary `move` actions to reach locations like `#o3` or `#o5`. The provided "move" actions only maintain the rovers' initial configurations, making the system unsolvable.
