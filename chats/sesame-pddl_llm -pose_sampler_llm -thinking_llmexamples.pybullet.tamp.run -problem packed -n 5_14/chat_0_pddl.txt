(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to determine 50 stable placements, defined by `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`, for an object (ID 4) on a single surface. The surface is an AABB with dimensions of (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). The object's size, nearly square, is `0.07086...` by `0.07086...`. Since the object will rotate, I must consider the object's AABB for different orientations.
           
           To find stable placements, I will:
           
           1.  **Iterate Through Rotations:** I'll use 10 distinct angles from 0 to pi radians, in increments of `pi/10`.
           2.  **Calculate Effective AABB:** For each angle, I will compute the effective bounding box dimensions (width, height) of the rotated object using the formula `W_eff = abs(hx * cos(theta)) + abs(hy * sin(theta))` and `H_eff = abs(hx * sin(theta)) + abs(hy * cos(theta))`, where `hx` and `hy` are half the object's dimensions.
           3.  **Determine Placement Range:** Calculate the valid center placement range for the object along the x and y axes. This range is the surface limits minus the effective half-extents of the rotated object's bounding box.
           4.  **Generate Placements:** For each rotation angle, I will create five placements:
               *   Center: A placement at the center of the surface.
               *   Top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right: Placements at the four corners of the allowable center range.
           
           Finally, confirm that I have exactly 50 placements.

(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for Object ID 5, Avoiding Collision with Object ID 4**
           
           I've been tasked with placing object ID 5 on surface 0, avoiding any collision with the already-placed object ID 4.  The key is to generate 50 stable placements that meet this condition.
           
           Object ID 4 is already positioned at (0, 0) and, because it's at zero rotation, forms an axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) centered on itself. I've calculated the effective width and height of this AABB using its dimensions, which defines the region it occupies.
           
           My strategy involves considering the dimensions and boundaries of surface 0 and object ID 5. I'll need to account for both position and rotation (theta) when calculating the effective width and height of object ID 5's AABB.
           
           To ensure no collision, I need to ensure object ID 5's AABB doesn't overlap with object ID 4's. For this, I am establishing four "strips" or regions around object ID 4 where object ID 5's center can be placed, by using thresholds (based on bounding box and rotation) I can use to generate 8 placement points per angle. For 6 angles plus 2 more rotations with a single placement, I'll have the necessary number of placements: 50.
           
           I'm limited in this situation, because there are angles (pi/4 for example) where the object dimensions are too large, which means I won't be able to fit the object inside this surface and must only choose angles very close to the standard angles.
           
           To generate a diverse set of placements, I will be using angles `0, 0.04, 0.08, pi/2, pi/2+0.04, pi/2+0.08, pi, pi+0.04` and using 8 points:
           
           1. `(x_v_min, y_v_min)`
           2. `(x_v_min, y_v_max)`
           3. `(x_v_max, y_v_min)`
           4. `(x_v_max, y_v_max)`
           5. `(-x_th, 0)`
           6. `(x_th, 0)`
           7. `(0, -y_th)`
           8. `(0, y_th)`
           
           With this approach, I aim to generate a reliable set of collision-free placement options for object ID 5.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy Summary**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've got to place this new object (ID 6) on surface 0, and I need to avoid bumping into the existing objects (ID 4 and ID 5). I'm aiming for 50 stable placements.
           
           First, I've defined the surface as a square, centered at (0,0) with size -0.135 to 0.135. Object ID 4 is also at (0,0), and ID 5 is a bit off-center, at around (-0.09, -0.09).  I have all the measurements: the size, the AABB, and half-extents for each object.
           
           To place object 6, I'm going to consider its effective size, `eff_W_6` and `eff_H_6`, based on its rotation, `theta_6`.  The valid center for object 6 needs to be inside the surface, minus its effective size and any collision with objects 4 and 5.
           
           Here's the detailed logic:
           
           1.  **Surface Containment:** To be completely contained, the object's center has to be within a specific range, based on its effective size, as affected by rotation.  `x_min_s <= x_6 <= x_max_s` and `y_min_s <= y_6 <= y_max_s`.
           
           2.  **Collision Avoidance:**
               *   **With Object 4:** Collision happens if object 6's AABB overlaps with object 4's. That means `abs(x_6) >= 0.03543 + eff_W_6` OR `abs(y_6) >= 0.03543 + eff_H_6`.
               *   **With Object 5:** It is more complex, I need to check the coordinates of object 5's center and its half-extents in order to define a collision.
           
           **Calculating a safe placements:**
           
           I've learned that `eff_W_6` and `eff_H_6` change with `theta_6`. I need to be careful. The strategy is to select rotation angles for my objects very close to 0, pi/2, pi, or 3pi/2. For these angles, I need to make sure `eff_W_6` and `eff_H_6` are not too large. The safe region for object 6 is a small region in the top-right quarter of surface 0.
           The process is:
           
           *   I'll test 10 different angles, from 0 to 0.2 rad in intervals of 0.05, and similar angles around pi/2.
           *   For each angle: Calculate the `eff_W_6`, `eff_H_6`
           *   With those values, calculate the region that the object 6 can occupy safely. That will be a region in the upper-right corner. I will calculate its bounds based on collision.
           
           I will be able to generate up to 5 points for each set of ranges: the center of the region and its corners.
           This should yield enough unique points to have 50 placements. I will select the best 50 among these points.
