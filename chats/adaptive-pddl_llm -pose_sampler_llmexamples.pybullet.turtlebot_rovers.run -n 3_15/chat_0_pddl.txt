User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene consists of a central square area defined by obstacles 0-4, acting as walls. Obstacle 5 is a vertical wall through the center, effectively dividing the central area into two smaller areas. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the scene. The goal is to find a base position within a 2-unit radius of the target point, avoiding these obstacles and ensuring line-of-sight.
           
           My strategy is to generate positions in a circular pattern around the target point at a distance that allows for avoiding obstacles while maintaining line-of-sight. Given the target point is {target_point}, I will first try to place the robot at a distance of approximately 1.5 units from the target point. This provides a good balance of being close enough to the target but far enough to navigate around potential obstacles. I will select points at various angles around the target to ensure diversity.
           
           Let's calculate the positions:
           
           Target: {target_point}
           Max range: 2
           
           Positions:
           ({target_point[0] + 1.5} {target_point[1]})
           ({target_point[0] - 1.5} {target_point[1]})
           ({target_point[0]} {target_point[1] + 1.5})
