(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable positions for object ID 5, a square with dimensions 0.0978 by 0.0978, on surface 0, a square area from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  Since the object's a square, its bounding box size will always be the same, no matter the rotation. Let's call this side length `obj_s`, approximately 0.0978.
           
           First, I determine the valid area where the center of the object can be.  This means the center coordinates (x, y) must lie within a smaller square inside the surface. This inner square's sides will be `obj_s` less than the surface's sides. So the valid center coordinates are around -0.086 to 0.086 for both x and y.
           
           To get the 50 placements, I'll set up a 7x7 grid of points within the valid area, which gives me 49 placements. To ensure a good spread, I'll then add a 50th placement, centered, but with a different rotation. I'll make sure to get `math.pi / 4` rotation for the 50th and vary the angles for the rest.
           
           I calculate the actual placement bounds, and then generate a 7x7 grid of center points with a variable rotation for some placements. This results in 50 object placements.  Because the object is square, the bounding box *will always* stay within the valid surface bounds, provided the center stays in the calculated range.  I've double-checked my calculations to ensure the placements are stable and correctly formatted.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable, Non-Colliding Placements**
           
           My task is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 4 on a surface, ensuring they don't collide with object ID 5, which is already placed. I'm provided with the dimensions and placement of both objects and the surface boundaries.
           
           Object 4 is a square with a known side length, and Object 5's position and dimensions are established.  Surface 0 is defined as an axis-aligned box. To achieve this, I need to consider containment and collision simultaneously. First, I need to ensure that the new object, regardless of its rotation, fits within the surface. This involves calculating the maximum possible size of the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) when rotated.
           
           I'm generating a grid of potential center points within the bounds where the center can be placed, and the dimensions for the surface bounds. Next, for each grid point, I test a range of rotation angles. For each grid point and angle, I calculate the precise AABB of object 4 for that particular rotation. I then verify that the AABB is within surface bounds. If it's within bounds, I check if it collides with the pre-existing object 5. If it doesn't collide, I log this as a valid, stable placement.
           
           This methodology combines a systematic grid-based search and angle exploration.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for New Object**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for this new square object (ID 6) on Surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into the existing objects (IDs 4 and 5). I've got the surface boundaries and AABBs for the existing objects all mapped out. 
           
           The core challenge is avoiding collisions. I've calculated the minimum and maximum ranges for placing the object's center, considering its size (and potential rotations). The AABBs for the existing objects define areas that are off-limits. I'm taking the conservative approach of generating placements based on a grid, where each point is checked for a collision with any of the two existing AABBs.
           
           To generate the initial set of 50 stable placements, I will create a grid of (x,y) points across the allowed surface area, and for each point, I will rotate the square object with the defined grid of angles (from 0 to 2pi). I'll have a function to calculate the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) for any combination of (cx, cy, theta). If a combination of position and orientation collides, it's discarded.  
           
           In other words, I'll generate the initial grid of x and y with a slight reduction from the surface boundaries to ensure surface containment for any possible orientation. I'll test the grid of `(cx, cy)` points with a set of rotation angles and return the first 50 valid placements. If that is too strict, I'll allow a larger sampling of grid points (15x15) and angles to search more thoroughly, from 0 to 2pi. I'll be certain to make sure that each item on the generated list is non-colliding, and unique with respect to its rotational component. That's the plan.
