           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.695, -0.305), (-4.602, -0.213)).

           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Achieving the Goal: `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, here's my thought process. The user wants to achieve a goal that boils down to placing an object, `v12`, on another object, `v18`. From the initial state and the axiom definitions, the problem simplifies to getting `v12` to be *at* a specific pose, which is supported by `v18`. Since we're given that `type(v12, v17)`, the target needs to be determined and is currently located at `v13`.
           
           The core of the solution is:
           
           1.  **Move the Robot Base:** The robot needs to change its location and orientation to be able to pick up `v12`. Initially, the robot is at `v3` and the plan needs to involve `move_base`.
           2.  **Pick up the Object:** Use the `pick` action to pick up the object `v12` from its starting pose `v13`.
           3.  **Move Base again** The robot needs to change its location and orientation to be able to place `v12`.
           4.  **Place the Object:** Use the `place` action to place `v12` at the desired location, `p0`, on top of `v18`. The value of `#p0` is required and will be the (x, y, z, theta) continuous value on the `v18`.
           
           To implement the `pick` and `place` actions, the robot needs to move. A `move_base` action is needed before `pick` and another before `place` action. These actions need to have their preconditions and effects fulfilled to be valid.
           
           For the value of `#p0`, I need to determine the object's (x, y, z) position on top of the target, `v18`, based on the object's dimensions and the AABB of the objects. Since all objects' surfaces are at z=0.8, the placement height should also be z=0.8. The object's center is best-suited on top of the middle of `v18`. The rotation, which is not available in the given information but could be necessary, is assumed to be 0 for simplicity. So the plan is:
           
           1.  `move_base v3 #q3 #t8` - This gets the base to a position to pick up `v12`.
           2.  `pick v4 v12 v13 #g1 #q3 #t6` - Pick up `v12`.
           3.  `move_base #q3 #q2 #o0` - Get the base to a position to place `v12`
           4.  `place v4 v12 #p0 #g1 #q2 #t5` - Place `v12` at `p0`, which has been defined to be (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0).
           
           The key assumptions are that the actions (move/place) will not collide with other objects, and all the axioms on unsafeapproach, unsafepose and unsafeatraj are assumed to be false. Now, with these steps, and defining the target location in terms of its continuous values, the goal is achieved!
