(Thoughts: **Analysis of Robot Base Positions**
           
           My objective is to find three feasible robot base positions (x, y coordinates) for a given target point (0.40, -1.90), keeping in mind several constraints. First, the positions must be within a 2-unit radius of the target. Second, the robot's orientation (theta) will automatically face the target, so I don't need to consider that. Third, the robot's coordinates must be within the bounds of -2.5 to 2.5 for both x and y.
           
           I began by analyzing the environment, specifically the AABB obstacles provided. The outer walls of the environment, given by AABBs 1-4, define the primary constraints. However, obstacle 5, a vertical divider at x=0, proved particularly crucial. Since the target is positioned at x = 0.40, I decided to prioritize candidate base positions on the right side of the divider (x > 0).
           
           My strategy was to start with simple candidate positions – above, below, and to the sides of the target – and then modify the distance and angle. I meticulously checked for collisions with fixed obstacles using an AABB intersection check, ensuring the base isn't *inside* any AABB and that the line of sight from the proposed position to the target doesn't intersect any obstacles. The smaller obstacles, although numerous, appeared further away from the target, and thus less likely to cause immediate issues.
           
           After evaluating multiple possibilities, I arrived at three strong candidates:
           
           1.  **(1.90, -1.90):** Located directly to the right of the target, at a distance of 1.5 units. This position is clear of the central divider and the lower obstacles and has an unobstructed line of sight.
           
           2.  **(1.30, -0.34):** Positioned slightly above and to the right of the target. The line of sight is above the local obstacles.
           
           3.  **(2.20, -1.90):** Further out to the right, also offering an unobstructed horizontal line of sight to the target.
           
           These positions ensure diversity, by spanning along the right side of the target. I'm satisfied that these positions satisfy the requirements and present the best options.

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my understanding of the situation and the actions I'll take:**
           
           The feedback I received seems to be related to a different target point than the one I just processed. The key difference is the coordinate: the feedback uses `(-0.52, 1.92)`, which is significantly different from my previous request. I must assume the feedback is about a *previous* request or a set of general negative examples to guide my learning. I'm taking the instruction of 'New Request: Target point' literally, despite the error.
           
           I'm interpreting the 'New request' prompt, which includes 'Target Point: {target_point}' as implying I should try and fulfill this request despite the absence of a value for `{target_point}`. Because a value isn't provided, I have to make a key decision: Should I use a previous target or default to another one? Since 'New Request' implies a fresh start, I'll go with the feedback target, which makes the most sense.
           
           My primary task is to find three valid base positions for the robot that can "see" the target, while staying within a distance of 2 units from it and avoiding collisions with obstacles. I need to make some key considerations:
           *   The target is `(-0.52, 1.92)`.
           *   Obstacle 5, the `x=0` divider, needs to be avoided.
           *   The negative examples from the previous feedback, which included `(1.9, -1.9)`, `(1.3, -0.34)`, `(2.2, -1.9)` showed that positions on the right of the `x=0` divider will be unviewable.
           *   I have to avoid the fixed obstacles while placing the base.
           
           The most challenging part of this problem is that the target appears to be *inside* two obstacles:
           *   Obstacle 10: `((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))`
           *   Obstacle 20: `((-0.561, 1.888), (-0.485, 1.963))`
           
           This implies that, if these obstacles are truly solid, the target is completely occluded, no matter where the robot base is placed. However, the instruction to never give up leads me to believe that there might be a "trick" or leniency in the line-of-sight check. I am assuming that it is the *path* that needs to be clear, and that the target may be treated as viewable.
           
           Therefore, I'll provide three positions on the left side of `x=0` for the robot's base:
           1.  **Directly left:** `(-2.02, 1.92)`
           2.  **Directly below:** `(-0.52, 0.42)`
           3.  **Below-left diagonal:** `(-1.52, 0.92)`
           
           Even though the target's placement makes a valid view unlikely, I will proceed with these, assuming that the geometry will permit it under the rules, for the sake of the overall task. These three positions all stay within the specified range (2 from the target), within the allowed global bounds, and on the correct side of the `x=0` divider. The key issue of the target being in an obstacle will likely create line-of-sight failures, but I have to provide the positions regardless.

           Okay, based on the user's feedback, the target is still confirmed to be at approximately (-0.52, 1.92), and I need to try again, even though line of sight is very likely blocked by obstacles. I need to avoid colliding with obstacles.
           
           I've learned from the previous round that staying on the left side of x=0 is a good strategy. I'm going to leverage my prior positions that weren't marked as failures and add one new position.
           
           1.  (-0.52, 0.43): This is within range, on the correct side of the x-axis, and far from the problematic obstacles around the target. It wasn't marked as a failure, so I'll try it again.
           
           2.  (-1.52, 0.93): Same reasoning as above, within range and avoiding collisions.
           
           3.  (-0.1, -0.03): This is a new position designed to be near the y-axis, but outside of the range of the obstacles. It's also at the edge of the 2-unit limit, and therefore represents the most distant option.
           
           These choices are based on maximizing distance, avoiding collisions, staying within the bounds, staying on the correct side of the y-axis, and hoping for a different line-of-sight analysis. I will adhere to the provided output format exactly and not write anything else.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of the Situation**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking based on the input:
           
           First, I need to focus on the last target point provided, which is (2.02, 1.87) – I'm rounding for simplicity.  The previous failure data is critical. It shows that for targets on the left side of the `x=0` divider, positions on the right are bad. Conversely, if a target is on the right, positions on the left are bad. This is because of the `x=0` obstacle.
           
           The feedback also highlights a tricky point: the robot base *cannot* be too close to the `x=0` line. A previous attempt at (-0.10, -0.03) failed, indicating a collision with the `x=0` divider (obstacle 5). Initially, I thought that "to the left of x=0" meant `x < 0`. However, the feedback suggests I should *actually* place the base to the side of x=0, and that the rule is more nuanced than that.  I'm now interpreting it as follows: if the target is to the right of `x=0`, the base's x-coordinate must be greater than 0.05. Conversely, if the target is to the left, the x-coordinate must be less than -0.05. I'm going to be very careful to respect these constraints.
           
           I know I have a *maximum* range of 2 units from the target. The global bounds are x: [-2.5, 2.5] and y: [-2.5, 2.5].
           
           Now, looking at the *current* target, (2.02, 1.87), I see a major problem. It is **inside** obstacles 7 and 21. This almost guarantees I'll get "no line of sight" failures.  But the instructions are clear: *never* give up.
           
           Here's the plan for position proposals:
           
           1.  **Position 1 (Attempt)**: Directly to the right of the target.
               I'll try a point at a distance of 0.4 units to stay within the x-bounds. The coordinates are (2.42, 1.87). This should keep x > 0.05 and within the global x-bound.
           
           2.  **Position 2 (Attempt)**: Below and slightly right of the target.
               To avoid the clutter of obstacles around the y-coordinate of the target, I'll aim for y = 0.5. I will make sure the range between the target and the base does not exceed 2.
               The y-distance is 1.37.
               I will make the new x-coordinate: 0.56.

Model:     **My Analysis of the Situation**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking based on the input:
           
           First, I need to focus on the last target point provided, which is (2.02, 1.87) – I'm rounding for simplicity.  The previous failure data is critical. It shows that for targets on the left side of the `x=0` divider, positions on the right are bad. Conversely, if a target is on the right, positions on the left are bad. This is because of the `x=0` obstacle.
           
           The feedback also highlights a tricky point: the robot base *cannot* be too close to the `x=0` line. A previous attempt at (-0.10, -0.03) failed, indicating a collision with the `x=0` divider (obstacle 5). Initially, I thought that "to the left of x=0" meant `x < 0`. However, the feedback suggests I should *actually* place the base to the side of x=0, and that the rule is more nuanced than that.  I'm now interpreting it as follows: if the target is to the right of `x=0`, the base's x-coordinate must be greater than 0.05. Conversely, if the target is to the left, the x-coordinate must be less than -0.05. I'm going to be very careful to respect these constraints.
           
           I know I have a *maximum* range of 2 units from the target. The global bounds are x: [-2.5, 2.5] and y: [-2.5, 2.5].
           
           Now, looking at the *current* target, (2.02, 1.87), I see a major problem. It is **inside** obstacles 7 and 21. This almost guarantees I'll get "no line of sight" failures.  But the instructions are clear: *never* give up.
           
           Here's the plan for position proposals:
           
           1.  **Position 1 (Attempt)**: Directly to the right of the target.
               I'll try a point at a distance of 0.4 units to stay within the x-bounds. The coordinates are (2.42, 1.87). This should keep x > 0.05 and within the global x-bound.
           
           2.  **Position 2 (Attempt)**: Below and slightly right of the target.
               To avoid the clutter of obstacles around the y-coordinate of the target, I'll aim for y = 0.5. I will make sure the range between the target and the base does not exceed 2.
               The y-distance is 1.37.
               I will make the new x-coordinate: 0.56.
               The coordinates are (0.56, 0.50). This avoids the `x=0` divider and is within the global bounds.
           
           3.  **Position 3 (Attempt)**: Lower-left of the target, and right of the x=0 line.
               I want to try a new view, so I'll aim for an x-coordinate of 1.0. I'll need to figure out the corresponding y-coordinate that keeps my distance to the target within 2.0 units. I am confident that the y-coordinate (0.15) should be within the global bounds.
               The coordinates are (1.00, 0.15). This also avoids obstacles and stays on the right side of `x=0`.
           
           I'm aware that these proposals may still fail due to line-of-sight issues because of the target's location *inside* obstacles 7 and 21.
