           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown. I've got this new axiom to satisfy, which boils down to getting images and analyses of stuff (rocks and soil).  Initially, I was optimistic because the initial state has the rovers 'at' certain configurations and free to do stuff. However, the available moves completely cripple my ability to make progress.
           
           The core issue is these *extremely* limited `move` actions. I can only move the rovers in a way that *keeps* them in their current configurations.  This locks me into `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`. This is a hard constraint that cannot be relaxed.
           
           Now, all the cool stuff—taking pictures and analyzing rocks—needs the rovers to be at *specific* configurations that are *different* from their starting points.  For instance, `imagevisible` and `above` facts mention configurations like `#o3` and `#o5`. But, since the rovers can't *move* to these locations, I can't even get to the preconditions for actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`. I mean, I *could* drop a rock but that does nothing to the stated problem.
           
           No `move` action can take the rovers to these desired configurations, therefore `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` are impossible.  I can't receive images or analyses without those actions.
           
           So, since all the preconditions needed to satisfy `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` are unachievable, the whole `new-axiom@0()` goal is utterly beyond my reach.  The plan is dead in the water because of the restrictive movement constraints.
