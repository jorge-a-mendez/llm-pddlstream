User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point is (0.9161245785834812 0.8122047864819777).
           
           The environment has several obstacles.
           Walls are at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5.
           A central obstacle is at x = 0.
           Other obstacles:
           6: ((-2.4047, -2.3455502384913305), (-1.3952999999999998, -1.6544497615086693))
           7: ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25))
           8: ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25))
           9: ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))
           10: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))
           Small obstacles: 11-22
           
           The target point is in the first quadrant.
           I should try to place the robot in the vicinity of the target, avoiding the central obstacle and any other obstacles.
           
           I will try to place the robot around the target point, but not too close to the obstacle at (0, y).
           Considering the max_range=2 from the target (0.916 0.812), the robot can be placed in the region from (0.916-2, 0.812-2) to (0.916+2, 0.812+2).
           This range is from (-1.084, -1.188) to (2.916, 2.812).
           Considering the x and y limits for the robot: x in [-2.5, 2.5] and y in [-2.5, 2.5].
           So, the robot can be placed in x in [-1.084, 2.5] and y in [-1.188, 2.5].
           
           Obstacle 5 is at x=0. So I should avoid placing the robot with x coordinates around 0.
           Obstacles 9 and 15 are in the vicinity of the target point.
           
           I'll propose positions on different sides of the target point within the valid range, making sure to avoid known obstacles.
           
           Position 1: To the right and slightly below the target. This avoids the x=0 obstacle and is far from other obstacles.
           (1.8 0.5)
           
           Position 2: To the left and slightly below the target, but not too close to x=0.
           (0.2 0.5) - This might be too close to x=0. Let's try to be a bit more to the left.
           Let's try (0.3 0.5) to be safe from x=0 line. Oh, obstacle 14 is ((0.58, -0.2), (0.7, -0.09)). Obstacle 15 is ((0.07, 1.49), (0.21, 1.63)).
           So I will try a position (0.3 0.8), to the left of the target, but a bit further to the left to avoid being directly in line with obstacle 15 if the target is observed from the left.
           
           Position 3: Above the target.
           (0.9 1.5)
           
           Let's check the distance to target:
           (1.8, 0.5) dist = sqrt((1.8-0.916)^2 + (0.5-0.812)^2) = sqrt(0.884^2 + (-0.312)^2) = sqrt(0.0781 + 0.0973) = sqrt(0.871) = 0.933 < 2
           (0.3, 0.8) dist = sqrt((0.3-0.916)^2 + (0.8-0.812)^2) = sqrt((-0.616)^2 + (-0.012)^2) = sqrt(0.379 + 0.0001) = sqrt(0.379) = 0.616 < 2
           (0.9, 1.5) dist = sqrt((0.9-0.916)^2 + (1.5-0.812)^2) = sqrt((-0.016)^2 + (0.688)^2) = sqrt(0.000256 + 0.473) = sqrt(0.473) = 0.688 < 2
           
           All positions are within range.
           All positions are within the x y limits [-2.5, 2.5].
           
           Positions:
           (1.8 0.5)
           (0.3 0.8)
           (0.9 1.5)

User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point is (0.9161245785834812 0.8122047864819777).
           
           My previous proposed positions were:
           (1.8 0.5)
           (0.3 0.8)
           (0.9 1.5)
           
           Since I'm receiving a new request for the same target point, it's likely that one or more of my previous positions were invalid due to collision with a non-fixed obstacle or an occlusion that I'm not aware of.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the target (0.916, 0.812) and the surrounding obstacles.
           Obstacle 5 is at x=0.
           Obstacle 9: ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))
           Obstacle 12: ((0.441, 1.018), (0.559, 1.135))
           Obstacle 14: ((0.585, -0.209), (0.703, -0.091))
           Obstacle 15: ((0.072, 1.495), (0.213, 1.636))
           Obstacle 17: ((-0.644, 1.080), (-0.506, 1.218))
           Obstacle 21: ((0.555, 1.844), (0.647, 1.935))
           
           The target is at (0.916, 0.812).
           
           Let's analyze the previous positions:
           1. (1.8 0.5): This position is to the right and slightly below the target. It seems far from any of the listed obstacles.
           2. (0.3 0.8): This position is to the left of the target, and near the x=0 obstacle. It is also near obstacle 12 ((0.441, 1.018), (0.559, 1.135)). From (0.3, 0.8) to (0.916, 0.812), the line of sight might pass very close to obstacle 12 or obstacle 14, or even obstacle 5 if the target is observed from the left side of x=0. This position is suspicious.
           3. (0.9 1.5): This position is directly above the target. It is very close to obstacle 9 ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)), obstacle 12 ((0.441, 1.018), (0.559, 1.135)), and obstacle 15 ((0.072, 1.495), (0.213, 1.636)). It could be easily occluded or collide with these.
           
           I will try to keep (1.8 0.5) as it seems the safest.
           I will find two new positions.
           
           New positions will try to maintain distance from obstacles and provide good line of sight.
           
           New Position 2: Try to go further right from the target and slightly up.
           (2.0 1.0) dist from target (0.916, 0.812): sqrt((2.0-0.916)^2 + (1.0-0.812)^2) = sqrt(1.084^2 + 0.188^2) = sqrt(1.175 + 0.035) = sqrt(1.21) = 1.1 < 2. This is well within range and seems clear of obstacles.
           
           New Position 3: Try to go further below the target and to the right.
           (1.5 -0.5) dist from target (0.916, 0.812): sqrt((1.5-0.916)^2 + (-0.5-0.812)^2) = sqrt(0.584^2 + (-1.312)^2) = sqrt(0.341 + 1.721) = sqrt(2.062) = 1.43 < 2. This seems good as it is below most of the obstacles. Obstacle 14 is at ((0.585, -0.209), (0.703, -0.091)), so this position (1.5, -0.5) should have a clear line of sight.
           
           Positions:
           (1.8 0.5)
           (2.0 1.0)
           (1.5 -0.5)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point is (-0.3884505033493042, 2.1236228942871094).
           
           I have received feedback that all previous positions (1.8, 0.5), (2.0, 1.0), and (1.5, -0.5) had no line of sight to the target point (-0.388, 2.123). This indicates a significant occlusion.
           
           Let's re-examine the target and surrounding obstacles:
           Target: (-0.388, 2.123) - This is in the second quadrant, close to the top wall.
           The robot can be placed in x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5]. Max distance from target is 2.
           This means the robot can be in x: [-0.388 - 2, -0.388 + 2] = [-2.388, 1.612]
           And y: [2.123 - 2, 2.123 + 2] = [0.123, 4.123].
           Considering the y limit of 2.5, the y range is [0.123, 2.5].
           
           Obstacles close to the target:
           5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)) - This is the central vertical wall. The target is to the left of this wall.
           7: ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) - This is in the first quadrant, so it would easily block line of sight from the right if the robot is also on the right. This explains why (1.8, 0.5), (2.0, 1.0) and (1.5, -0.5) failed.
           8: ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)) - This is to the left of the target, but slightly higher on the y axis.
           9: ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)) - This is to the right of the central wall, and at a similar y-level to the target. This definitely creates an occlusion from the right side.
           10: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)) - This obstacle is *very close* to the target point, and is essentially an obstacle surrounding the target.
           Target x: -0.388, Target y: 2.123.
           Obstacle 10 x range: [-0.75, -0.25], y range: [1.75, 2.25].
           The target point (-0.388, 2.123) is *inside* obstacle 10's x range and *inside* obstacle 10's y range. This means the target point is *inside* obstacle 10.
           
           If the target point is inside an obstacle, then it's impossible to have a line of sight to it, and any proposed position will fail. This must be the problem.
           However, I must assume that a valid placement exists. This implies that the 'target point' given is not the true physical point, but perhaps a point *associated* with an object, and the true observable point is slightly offset from this. Or, more likely, my interpretation of "target point is inside obstacle 10" is incorrect, perhaps the target is meant to be viewed from *around* such an obstacle.
           Let's re-check the target point coordinates versus obstacle 10:
           Target: (-0.38845, 2.12362)
           Obstacle 10: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))
           Target x (-0.388) is between -0.75 and -0.25.
           Target y (2.123) is between 1.75 and 2.25.
           
           This is a critical piece of information. If the target is indeed inside obstacle 10, then no position will have line of sight. Given the problem statement, I must continue to try and find a position. This means my interpretation might be wrong, or the obstacle definition is for a bounding box, but the actual viewable part is outside of it.
           
           Given the previous failures for all positions (which were all on the right side of the central wall (x=0)), it suggests that anything on the right side of x=0 is occluded by the x=0 wall (obstacle 5) and possibly obstacles 9, 7.
           
           So, I must place the robot to the left of the central wall (x=0).
           The target is at (-0.388, 2.123).
           The robot should be placed to the left of x=0, so x < 0.
           The y range is [0.123, 2.5].
           
           Let's consider positions that are to the left of the target and the x=0 wall.
           Obstacle 8: ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)) - This is a large obstacle to the left and slightly below/at the same y-level as the target.
           Obstacle 10: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)) - This is the obstacle the target is 'inside'.
           
           If the target is truly "inside" obstacle 10, then I can't view it. Assuming it's *viewable from around* obstacle 10, I need to place the robot in a position that can see "around" this obstacle.
           
           Let's try:
           1. To the left and below the target/obstacle 10.
              x around -1.0, y around 1.0.
              Let's try (-1.0 1.0).
              Distance to target (-0.388, 2.123): sqrt((-1.0 - (-0.388))^2 + (1.0 - 2.123)^2) = sqrt((-0.612)^2 + (-1.123)^2) = sqrt(0.374 + 1.261) = sqrt(1.635) = 1.278 < 2.
              This is to the left of obstacle 10, and below it. This position avoids central wall and other right-side obstacles. It is also not in conflict with obstacle 8.
           
           2. Directly below the target/obstacle 10.
              x around -0.4, y around 0.5.
              Let's try (-0.4 0.5).
              Distance to target (-0.388, 2.123): sqrt((-0.4 - (-0.388))^2 + (0.5 - 2.123)^2) = sqrt((-0.012)^2 + (-1.623)^2) = sqrt(0.000144 + 2.634) = sqrt(2.634) = 1.623 < 2.
              This position is to the left of the central wall and below obstacle 10, and potentially offers a view.
           
           3. To the far left, avoiding obstacle 8.
              Obstacle 8 is from x=-2.25 to x=-1.75.
              So let's try an x of -2.0 for example, but adjusting for y.
              If I go for x = -2.0, y should be adjusted to be within range.
              (-2.0 1.5).
              Distance to target (-0.388, 2.123): sqrt((-2.0 - (-0.388))^2 + (1.5 - 2.123)^2) = sqrt((-1.612)^2 + (-0.623)^2) = sqrt(2.598 + 0.388) = sqrt(2.298) = 1.716 < 2.
              This position is to the left of obstacle 8 (x < -2.25) or between the target and obstacle 8. Here, x = -2.0 is within the x-range of obstacle 8. Let me try to place it to the left of obstacle 8.
              So let's try (-2.4 2.0).
              Distance to target (-0.388, 2.123): sqrt((-2.4 - (-0.388))^2 + (2.0 - 2.123)^2) = sqrt((-2.012)^2 + (-0.123)^2) = sqrt(4.048 + 0.015) = sqrt(4.063) = 2.015 > 2. This is out of range.
           
              Let's reconsider Position 3. How about slightly above the target, but still left of x=0.
              The maximum y is 2.5. The target is 2.123.
              Let's try (-0.5 2.5). This is at the upper limit of y.
              Distance to target (-0.388, 2.123): sqrt((-0.5 - (-0.388))^2 + (2.5 - 2.123)^2) = sqrt((-0.112)^2 + (0.377)^2) = sqrt(0.0125 + 0.142) = sqrt(0.1545) = 0.393 < 2.
              This is to the left of x=0. It is just above obstacle 10. This seems promising if the target is viewable from just above.
           
           Given the extreme difficulty (target seemingly inside an obstacle), I will focus on positions to the left of the x=0 wall (obstacle 5) and try different angles around the assumed target location.
           
           Positions:
           (-1.0 1.0)
           (-0.4 0.5)
           (-0.5 2.5)

           (1.5 -0.5)
           
           Second set (feedback not yet received, but assume they also failed as I am getting a new request):
           (-1.0 1.0)
           (-0.4 0.5)
           (-0.5 2.5)
           
           All previous attempts have failed. This suggests an extremely challenging target point.
           As I analyzed before, the target point (-0.388, 2.123) is *within* the bounding box of obstacle 10 ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)). If the target is truly inside an obstacle, no line of sight is possible. However, the problem statement implies a solution exists, so I must adjust my understanding.
           
           This situation implies that either:
           1. The obstacles are hollow or have a specific viewable section that is not fully described by the AABB.
           2. The "target point" is a reference for an object, and the actual viewable surface is offset from this point.
           3. The problem is exceptionally difficult and requires a very precise, perhaps counter-intuitive, position.
           
           Given that *all* positions tried so far (from both sides of the central barrier x=0, and from below/above the target) have failed, I need to try a different strategy.
           The previous positions covered a range:
           - Right side: (1.8, 0.5), (2.0, 1.0), (1.5, -0.5) - all failed. Likely due to x=0 wall and obstacles 7, 9.
           - Left side: (-1.0, 1.0), (-0.4, 0.5), (-0.5, 2.5) - presumably failed. These tried to go around obstacle 10 from below and above.
           
           Let's assume the target is *very slightly* outside obstacle 10, or that there's a small "window" from which to view it.
           Target: (-0.388, 2.123)
           Obstacle 10: x in [-0.75, -0.25], y in [1.75, 2.25].
           
           The target is close to the right edge of obstacle 10 (x=-0.25).
           The target is also close to the top edge of obstacle 10 (y=2.25).
           
           Perhaps I need to place the robot almost directly on top of obstacle 10 (if permitted, though it implies collision) or view it from a very specific angle.
           Let's try positions that are very close to the edges of obstacle 10, but outside it.
           The max range is 2. The target is (-0.388, 2.123).
           
           Position 1: To the right of obstacle 10, but still left of x=0. This would mean very close to x=-0.25, but slightly greater.
           Let's try x = -0.2, y = 2.1.
           Distance: sqrt((-0.2 - (-0.388))^2 + (2.1 - 2.123)^2) = sqrt(0.188^2 + (-0.023)^2) = sqrt(0.0353 + 0.0005) = sqrt(0.0358) = 0.189 < 2.
           This position (-0.2, 2.1) is very close to the target, to its right. It is also to the right of obstacle 10's x-range. This position is still left of x=0.
           
           Position 2: Below obstacle 10. We tried (-0.4 0.5), which was further down. Let's try something closer.
           How about x = -0.4, y = 1.7. This is just below obstacle 10's y-range.
           Distance: sqrt((-0.4 - (-0.388))^2 + (1.7 - 2.123)^2) = sqrt((-0.012)^2 + (-0.423)^2) = sqrt(0.000144 + 0.1789) = sqrt(0.179) = 0.423 < 2.
           
           Position 3: To the left of obstacle 10. We tried (-1.0 1.0). Let's try something closer to the target's y-level.
           x = -0.8, y = 2.1. This is just to the left of obstacle 10's x-range, and at the target's y-level.
           Distance: sqrt((-0.8 - (-0.388))^2 + (2.1 - 2.123)^2) = sqrt((-0.412)^2 + (-0.023)^2) = sqrt(0.1697 + 0.0005) = sqrt(0.1702) = 0.412 < 2.
           
           These three positions are very close to the target, and attempt to view it from just outside the bounding box of obstacle 10, assuming that the obstacle itself doesn't perfectly block line of sight from all directions. This strategy is based on the idea that if the target is "inside" the bounding box, perhaps the actual viewable point is very near an edge of that bounding box.
           
           Positions:
           (-0.2 2.1)
           (-0.4 1.7)
           (-0.8 2.1)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     The target point for the *current* request is (1.9394278526306152, 1.912412405014038).
           
           The previous feedback relates to two different target points.
           1. Target point: (-0.3884505033493042, 2.1236228942871094). All 6 positions I proposed for this target failed (first 3 for no line of sight, the next 3 were not explicitly reported but the fact I got a new request implies they failed as well, if I assume no intervening successful positions).
           The new feedback is specifically for the current target point (1.939, 1.912). My previous responses mistakenly assumed the target point was the one that previously failed. My apologies.
           
           Let's focus on the current target point: (1.939, 1.912).
           The feedback states that my last three proposed positions for *this* target point (which I generated thinking it was the previous one) all failed due to collisions:
           - (-0.2, 2.1) collided with:
               - Obstacle 5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)) (Central wall)
               - Obstacle 10: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))
               - Obstacle 20: ((-0.4308, 2.081), (-0.346, 2.165))
           - (-0.4, 1.7) collided with:
               - Obstacle 10: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))
           - (-0.8, 2.1) collided with:
               - Obstacle 10: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))
               - Obstacle 11: ((-1.063, 2.133), (-0.948, 2.247))
           
           This new target point (1.939, 1.912) is in the first quadrant, close to the upper-right corner of the environment.
           
           Robot limits: x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5]. Max distance from target is 2.
           Target (1.939, 1.912).
           Possible range for robot:
           x: [1.939 - 2, 1.939 + 2] = [-0.061, 3.939] -> bounded by [-0.061, 2.5]
           y: [1.912 - 2, 1.912 + 2] = [-0.088, 3.912] -> bounded by [-0.088, 2.5]
           
           Obstacles in the vicinity of (1.939, 1.912):
           5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)) - Central wall. This would occlude from the left of x=0.
           7: ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) - This obstacle is *very close* to the target point.
           Target x (1.939) is within [1.75, 2.25].
           Target y (1.912) is within [1.75, 2.25].
           So, the target point is *inside* obstacle 7.
           
           This is the same situation as before, where the target was inside obstacle 10. This is a recurring theme!
           If the target is inside an obstacle, I need to try to view it from just outside its bounding box.
           
           The previous failed positions for this target point:
           (-0.2, 2.1), (-0.4, 1.7), (-0.8, 2.1). All these are to the left of the central wall (x=0). They are also quite far from the target (1.939, 1.912) and were likely proposed because I was mistakenly targeting the previous point. It's no surprise they collided with other obstacles far away from the target itself.
           
           I need to propose positions that are close to (1.939, 1.912) but *outside* obstacle 7.
           Obstacle 7: x in [1.75, 2.25], y in [1.75, 2.25].
           
           Position 1: To the right of obstacle 7.
           x = 2.4, y = 1.9.
           Distance from target (1.939, 1.912): sqrt((2.4 - 1.939)^2 + (1.9 - 1.912)^2) = sqrt(0.461^2 + (-0.012)^2) = sqrt(0.2125 + 0.000144) = sqrt(0.2126) = 0.461 < 2.
           This position is within x: [-0.061, 2.5] and y: [-0.088, 2.5]. It is to the right of obstacle 7 and within the overall limits.
           
           Position 2: Below obstacle 7.
           x = 1.9, y = 1.6.
           Distance from target (1.939, 1.912): sqrt((1.9 - 1.939)^2 + (1.6 - 1.912)^2) = sqrt((-0.039)^2 + (-0.312)^2) = sqrt(0.0015 + 0.0973) = sqrt(0.0988) = 0.314 < 2.
           This position is within limits and below obstacle 7.
           
           Position 3: To the left of obstacle 7.
           x = 1.6, y = 1.9.
           Distance from target (1.939, 1.912): sqrt((1.6 - 1.939)^2 + (1.9 - 1.912)^2) = sqrt((-0.339)^2 + (-0.012)^2) = sqrt(0.1149 + 0.000144) = sqrt(0.115) = 0.339 < 2.
           This position is within limits and to the left of obstacle 7. This position is still to the right of the central wall x=0.
           
           I will try these three positions, attempting to view the target from various sides just outside the obstacle that seems to contain it.
           
           Positions:
           (2.4 1.9)
           (1.9 1.6)

Model:     The target point for the *current* request is (-2.1328020095825195, 2.1353936195373535).
           
           My apologies for the previous mix-up with target points. I will ensure to use the correct target for this request.
           
           The feedback for the *current target point* (-2.132, 2.135) is that all three previously proposed positions failed due to collisions:
           - (2.4, 1.9) collided with:
               - Obstacle 3: ((2.45, -2.55), (2.55, 2.55)) - Right wall. (My proposed x=2.4 is close to 2.45, so this is likely the fixed wall).
               - Obstacle 7: ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25))
           - (1.9, 1.6) collided with:
               - Obstacle 7: ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25))
           - (1.6, 1.9) collided with:
               - Obstacle 7: ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25))
           
           These previous positions were on the far right side of the environment. Given the target point is at (-2.132, 2.135), these positions are extremely far from the target and it is logical they would fail due to collisions with objects in the path or simply being out of range for line-of-sight (even if not explicitly stated as 'no line of sight', a collision implies invalidity).
           
           Let's correctly analyze the new target point: (-2.132, 2.135).
           This target is in the second quadrant, near the top-left corner of the environment.
           
           Robot limits: x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5]. Max distance from target is 2.
           Target: (-2.132, 2.135).

           x: [-2.132 - 2, -2.132 + 2] = [-4.132, -0.132] -> bounded by [-2.5, -0.132]
           y: [2.135 - 2, 2.135 + 2] = [0.135, 4.135] -> bounded by [0.135, 2.5]
           
           Obstacles in the vicinity of (-2.132, 2.135):
           4: ((-2.55, -2.55), (-2.45, 2.55)) - Left wall.
           5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)) - Central wall.
           8: ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)) - This obstacle is *very close* to the target point.
           Target x (-2.132) is within [-2.25, -1.75].
           Target y (2.135) is within [1.75, 2.25].
           Again, the target point is *inside* a fixed obstacle (Obstacle 8).
           
           This is the third time this has happened. The strategy is to find positions just outside the bounding box of the containing obstacle.
           
           Obstacle 8: x in [-2.25, -1.75], y in [1.75, 2.25].
           
           Position 1: To the left of obstacle 8.
           x = -2.4, y = 2.1.
           Distance from target (-2.132, 2.135): sqrt((-2.4 - (-2.132))^2 + (2.1 - 2.135)^2) = sqrt((-0.268)^2 + (-0.035)^2) = sqrt(0.0718 + 0.0012) = sqrt(0.073) = 0.27 < 2.
           This position is within x: [-2.5, -0.132] and y: [0.135, 2.5]. It is to the left of obstacle 8, and not conflicting with the left wall (x=-2.5).
           
           Position 2: Below obstacle 8.
           x = -2.0, y = 1.6.
           Distance from target (-2.132, 2.135): sqrt((-2.0 - (-2.132))^2 + (1.6 - 2.135)^2) = sqrt(0.132^2 + (-0.535)^2) = sqrt(0.0174 + 0.2862) = sqrt(0.3036) = 0.55 < 2.
           This position is within limits and below obstacle 8.
           
           Position 3: Above obstacle 8.
           x = -2.0, y = 2.4.
           Distance from target (-2.132, 2.135): sqrt((-2.0 - (-2.132))^2 + (2.4 - 2.135)^2) = sqrt(0.132^2 + 0.265^2) = sqrt(0.0174 + 0.0702) = sqrt(0.0876) = 0.29 < 2.
           This position is within limits and above obstacle 8.
           
           Positions:
           (-2.4 2.1)
           (-2.0 1.6)
           (-2.0 2.4)
