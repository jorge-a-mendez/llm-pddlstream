(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation Strategy for a Square Object**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a square object (ID: 8) on a single, square surface (ID: 0).  The surface's dimensions are -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. The object is also square, with a side length of approximately 0.096.
           
           A *stable* placement means the object is fully *within* the surface and doesn't collide with anything else (at this point, nothing else is placed).  A placement is defined by the surface index (which is always 0), the rotation angle (`theta`), and the center coordinates (x, y).
           
           The trick is understanding how rotation affects things. When rotated by `theta`, a square's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) dimensions change. The key is to calculate the *maximum* possible offset of the object's center from the surface's edges in the x and y directions.
           
           Since it's a square, I can simplify the math.  The effective half-dimension of the *rotated* AABB is `0.5 * 0.096 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.  The maximum effective half-dimension occurs when `theta` is 45 degrees or its multiples.  That value is roughly 0.068.
           
           So, the center of the object must be within the range `-0.135 + effective_half_dim` and `0.135 - effective_half_dim`.  In the *worst-case* scenario (when rotated by 45 degrees), that translates to the center needing to be within roughly `-0.067` and `0.067`.
           
           To ensure diversity, I'll focus on a few key angles: 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees, and their 45-degree rotations.  I need at least a few placements from each rotation.  
           
           For the cases of 0 and 90, the valid center region ranges between approximately -0.087 to 0.087.  For a 45-degree rotation, that region shrinks to -0.067 to 0.067. For 10 for each.
           
           I'll create a grid of `x` and `y` values that are centered on the origin, covering the calculated valid ranges.  I will have a diverse distribution within each of the angle groups. I will have a few placed at each edge.
           
           By carefully considering the rotated object's dimensions and applying that restriction to a small number of key angles, I should be able to ensure these 50 placements are all stable and reasonably spaced. The specific coordinates, which I have computed based on the limits, are below.
           
           *theta = 0*:
           `(0, -0.08694404713780151, -0.08694404713780151)`

(Thoughts: **New Placement Generation Strategy**
           
           The user has requested another set of 50 placements for object ID 8 on surface 0. This implies that the previous set was either fully stable or that any failures didn't introduce new learning opportunities. Therefore, I need to generate a new set of stable, diverse placements, reusing my previous reasoning. The object is a square with side `s = 0.09611190572439698`, and the surface is a square from `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           
           My strategy will involve generating diverse placements by varying the rotation angle (`theta`) and the (x, y) position within the stable range.
           
           **Calculations & Strategy Details:**
           
           *   **Surface Size:** Surface half-width (`S_half`) is 0.135.
           *   **Rotations:**  I'll use angles `0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, pi/2, 2pi/3, 3pi/4, 5pi/6, pi`.
           *   **Stable Range Calculation:**
               *   For each angle, I need to calculate the effective half-size of the object, `half_s_eff`, considering its rotation, using `s_eff = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))` and  `half_s_eff = s_eff / 2`.
               *   The maximum displacement from the center of the surface (`max_coord`) is `S_half - half_s_eff`.
           *   **Coordination Strategy:** For diversity, I will generate placements for multiple points. For each theta, I'll generate a series of `x`, `y` coordinates:
               *   Center (0,0)
               *   (m,0), (-m,0), (0,m), (0,-m) where `m = max_coord`.
               *   (m/2, m/2), (-m/2, -m/2), (m/2, -m/2), (-m/2, m/2), where `m = max_coord`.
               *   (m,m), (-m,-m), (-m, m), (m,-m) where `m = max_coord`.
           
           **Calculated `m` values:**
           *   `m_0 = 0.08694404713780151`
           *   `m_30 = 0.06934904081`
           *   `m_45 = 0.06704903815009076`
           *   `m_60 = 0.06934904081`
           *   `m_90 = 0.08694404713780151`
           
           **Placement Generation breakdown:**
           I will generate 50 total placements, breaking the total placements up by the various angles I will check.
           *   Angle `0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, pi/2` will each have a group of 6 possible placement sites, adding to a total of `5 * 6 = 30` placements.
           *   Angle `2pi/3, 3pi/4, 5pi/6` will each have a group of 5 possible placement sites, adding a total of `3 * 5 = 15` placements.
           *   To get my final placements, I add in an extra 5 `theta = 0` placements, giving my total of 50.
           
           I will use these specific `m` values for coordinate calculations. These placements will be then be checked and returned.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object ID 8**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for a square object (side `s = 0.096`) on a square surface (`-0.135` to `0.135`). My goal is to maximize diversity in these placements, focusing on both rotation and position within the surface.  I'll be using a mix of calculated rotations (theta) from 0 to 2pi and coordinates, varying these coordinates according to the rotation applied to this square.
           
           I've calculated the effective half-width of the square, accounting for rotation using the formula `(s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))) / 2`.  From there, I'll calculate the `max_c`, or max center coordinate, the maximum amount the object center can be away from the origin without part of the object going out of bounds. This max coordinate is `0.135 - half_s_eff`.
           
           To achieve diverse placements, I'll use 6 rotational angles: `0`, `pi/6`, `pi/4`, `pi/3`, `pi/2`, and `2*pi/3`. For each angle, I will position the center of the square at the position `(0,0)`, positions along the edges of the square region (e.g. `(m,0)`, `(0,m)`), diagonal positions inside the bounds, (e.g., `(m/2, m/2)`, `(-m/2, -m/2)`, `(m/2, -m/2)`, `(-m/2, m/2)`) for 5 of those angles. The final angle will only receive 5 positions: `(0, 0)`, `(max_c, 0)`, `(-max_c, 0)`, `(0, max_c)`, `(0, -max_c)`.
           
           This strategy should yield a varied set of placements while meeting the precise count of 50. I'll make sure to use `math.pi` and functions from the math module to ensure numerical accuracy.

(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Stable Object Positioning**
           
           My goal is to generate 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 8, side length s = 0.09611190572439698) on a square surface (surface 0, half-width/height S_half = 0.135).  Stability requires the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) to fit entirely within the surface boundaries, regardless of its rotation.  The challenge lies in finding optimal object center coordinates `(x, y)` for each rotation `theta`.
           
           First, I need to calculate the effective side length `s_eff` of the rotated object's AABB: `s_eff = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.  The half-dimension of the AABB is `half_s_eff = s_eff / 2`.  To ensure stability, the object's center must lie within a smaller square centered on the origin, where the maximum allowed coordinate `max_c` is `S_half - half_s_eff`.
           
           I've determined key `max_c` values for various rotations:
           *   `theta = 0, pi/2`: `max_c = 0.08694404713780151`
           *   `theta = pi/4`: `max_c = 0.06704903815009076`

           *   `theta = pi/3`: `max_c = 0.06937454081`
           
           To create diversity, I decided to use the following angles: `0`, `pi/6`, `pi/4`, `pi/3`, and `pi/2`. For each angle I'll generate 10 positions giving 50 in total.  I have created a system that will position the objects such that there is diversity along the entire surface of the base shape. I decided on the positions:
           1.  (0, 0)

Model:     **Placement Strategy for Stable Object Positioning**
           
           My goal is to generate 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 8, side length s = 0.09611190572439698) on a square surface (surface 0, half-width/height S_half = 0.135).  Stability requires the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) to fit entirely within the surface boundaries, regardless of its rotation.  The challenge lies in finding optimal object center coordinates `(x, y)` for each rotation `theta`.
           
           First, I need to calculate the effective side length `s_eff` of the rotated object's AABB: `s_eff = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.  The half-dimension of the AABB is `half_s_eff = s_eff / 2`.  To ensure stability, the object's center must lie within a smaller square centered on the origin, where the maximum allowed coordinate `max_c` is `S_half - half_s_eff`.
           
           I've determined key `max_c` values for various rotations:
           *   `theta = 0, pi/2`: `max_c = 0.08694404713780151`
           *   `theta = pi/4`: `max_c = 0.06704903815009076`
           *   `theta = pi/6`: `max_c = 0.06937454081`
           *   `theta = pi/3`: `max_c = 0.06937454081`

           5.  (0, -mc)
           6.  (mc, mc)
           7.  (-mc, -mc)
           8.  (mc, -mc)

(Thoughts: **Stable Object Placement Strategy**
           
           I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 8) on a square surface (surface 0). The surface is defined as `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`, giving me a half-side length, `S_half`, of 0.135.  The object itself is a square with side length `s = 0.09611190572439698`.
           
           To determine stability, I must consider the object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) as it's rotated by an angle `theta`. The effective width/height of this rotated AABB, `s_eff`, is calculated as `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.  Half of this is `half_s_eff = s_eff / 2`.  For a placement `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)` to be stable, the rotated object's AABB must fit entirely within the surface's AABB. This boils down to ensuring the object's center `(x, y)` satisfies the following constraints:  `x_min_surface + half_s_eff <= x <= x_max_surface - half_s_eff` and `y_min_surface + half_s_eff <= y <= y_max_surface - half_s_eff`.
           
           Given the surface's centered-at-origin nature and its known `S_half`, these inequalities simplify to: `-max_c <= x <= max_c` and `-max_c <= y <= max_c`, where `max_c = S_half - half_s_eff = 0.135 - (s / 2) * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.
           
           My strategy involves selecting 5 different angles (`0`, `pi/6`, `pi/4`, `pi/3`, and `pi/2`) and then calculating the corresponding `max_c` values for each. I'll then distribute 10 unique `(x, y)` positions within the allowed range for each angle, thus generating a total of 50 placements.
           
           Here's the breakdown of how I'll do this:
           
           1.  **Calculate `max_c` for each angle:** I've pre-computed `max_c` for the selected angles, taking `s = 0.09611190572439698` into account:
               *   `theta = 0`:  `max_c_0 = 0.08694404713780151`
               *   `theta = pi/6`:  `max_c_30 = 0.06937454081`
               *   `theta = pi/4`:  `max_c_45 = 0.06704903815009076`
               *   `theta = pi/3`:  `max_c_60 = 0.06937454081`
               *   `theta = pi/2`:  `max_c_90 = 0.08694404713780151`
           
           2.  **Generate `(x, y)` positions:** For each `theta`, I'll generate 10 unique positions using its corresponding `max_c`. These will include center, corner, and edge-midpoint positions within the valid region.
           
           This method guarantees that all 50 generated placements are stable and well-distributed across different orientations, fulfilling the requirements.

           I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 8) on a square surface (surface 0).

           To determine stability, I must consider the object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) as it's rotated by an angle `theta`. The effective width/height of this rotated AABB, `s_eff`, is calculated as `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.  Half of this is `half_s_eff = s_eff / 2`.  For a placement `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)` to be stable, the rotated object's AABB must fit entirely within the surface's AABB. This boils down to ensuring the object's center `(x, y)` satisfies the following constraints:  `x_min_surface + half_s_eff <= x <= x_max_surface - half_s_eff` and `y_min_surface + half_s_eff <= y <= y_max_surface - half_s_eff`.
           
           Given the surface's centered-at-origin nature and its known `S_half`, these inequalities simplify to: `-max_c <= x <= max_c` and `-max_c <= y <= max_c`, where `max_c = S_half - half_s_eff = 0.135 - (s / 2) * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.

(Thoughts: **My Approach to Generating Stable Object Placements**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The task is to find 50 stable placements for a square object (ID: 8, side length `s = 0.096`) on a square surface (surface 0) with dimensions `[-0.135, 0.135] x [-0.135, 0.135]`.  My strategy involves considering the object's effective AABB after rotation.
           
           First, I need to calculate the effective half-width and half-height (`half_s_eff`) of the rotated square.  For a square, this is straightforward:  `half_s_eff = (s / 2) * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`, where `theta` is the rotation angle.  The object's center must stay within the surface's boundaries, accounting for `half_s_eff`: `[-max_c, max_c]`. `max_c = S_half - half_s_eff`, where `S_half` is 0.135 (surface half-dimension).
           
           To get diverse placements, I'll use a set of rotation angles: 0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and pi/2.  I then calculated the corresponding `max_c` values for each angle, ensuring I considered the correct trigonometric values:
           *   `theta = 0`:  `max_c_0 = 0.08694404713780151`
           *   `theta = pi/6`:  `max_c_pi/6 = 0.06937454080981576`
           *   `theta = pi/4`:  `max_c_pi/4 = 0.06704903815009076`
           *   `theta = pi/3`:  `max_c_pi/3 = 0.06937454080981576`
           *   `theta = pi/2`:  `max_c_pi/2 = 0.08694404713780151`
           
           For each rotation, I'll generate 10 placements. These placements will be distributed evenly within the bounds of `max_c` to make it varied. With these calculations and placements planned, I should be able to deliver 50 distinct and stable placements as requested. I double-checked the calculations for the bounds and angles to guarantee I am providing diverse and accurate data.

(Thoughts: **My Placement Strategy for Object 8 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to generate 50 stable placements for this square object (ID 8) on the square surface (ID 0).  The core of the problem is accounting for the object's effective size when it's rotated. I immediately recall the necessary formula:  the effective side length (`s_eff`) of a rotated square is `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`, where `s` is the original side length and `theta` is the rotation angle.  This makes perfect sense - the bounding box changes with rotation.
           
           I've got the surface size, its half-width (`S_half`), and the object's size (`s`).  Since the surface is centered at the origin, the placement calculation simplifies nicely: I just need to ensure the object's center stays within a smaller square defined by `S_half` minus the effective half-size of the rotated object.  That gives me my `max_c` value: `S_half - half_s_eff`.
           
           Now, for the placement strategy. To create diverse placements, I'll select several rotation angles. For each angle, I will generate 10 placements.
           
           Firstly, I calculate `max_c` for a few key angles, specifically `0`, `pi/6`, `pi/4`, `pi/3` and `pi/2`. Angle 0 has the largest available placement area. For `pi/4`, the effective size is sqrt(2) * s.
           
           For each rotation, I'll spread my placements as follows:
           *   Center of the available bounding box.
           *   Corners of the available bounding box.
           *   Midpoints of the sides of the available bounding box.
           *   One point in the first quadrant of the available bounding box.
           
           This provides even coverage of space. Let's get these coordinates into a convenient format, and the job is done.

(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 8**
           
           Okay, I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for object ID 8 on surface 0, which is a square. I know the surface's dimensions, with a half-width of `0.135`. The object itself is a square with sides of `0.09611190572439698`.  The key here is that stability means the rotated object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) must remain *entirely* within the surface.
           
           I've already figured out that the effective half-width of the object's AABB (`half_s_eff`) changes with the rotation angle (`theta`). It's a function of `abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))`. This directly impacts the allowed range for the object's center `(x, y)`, which is `[-max_c, max_c]`, where `max_c = S_half - half_s_eff`.
           
           I've done the math for a few critical angles: 0, pi/4, and pi/6. I need to calculate a max_c to use for the allowed coordinates. My goal now is to use a set of fixed angles to generate positions. I'm going to choose five angles (`0`, `pi/6`, `pi/4`, `pi/3`, `pi/2`). For each angle, I will generate 10 positions and get 50 stable placements. I will generate positions based on the `max_c` value calculated at each angle. I will ensure that the center of object is stable at each of those positions.

           Okay, I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for object ID 8 on surface 0, which is a square. I know the surface's dimensions, with a half-width of `0.135`. The object itself is a square with sides of `0.09611190572439698`.  The key here is that stability means the rotated object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) must remain *entirely* within the surface.
           
           I've already figured out that the effective half-width of the object's AABB (`half_s_eff`) changes with the rotation angle (`theta`). It's a function of `abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))`. This directly impacts the allowed range for the object's center `(x, y)`, which is `[-max_c, max_c]`, where `max_c = S_half - half_s_eff`.
           
           I've done the math for a few critical angles: 0, pi/4, and pi/6. I need to calculate a max_c to use for the allowed coordinates. My goal now is to use a set of fixed angles to generate positions. I'm going to choose five angles (`0`, `pi/6`, `pi/4`, `pi/3`, `pi/2`). For each angle, I will generate 10 positions and get 50 stable placements. I will generate positions based on the `max_c` value calculated at each angle. I will ensure that the center of object is stable at each of those positions.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **My thought process for generating the 50 stable placements is as follows:**
           
           I understand the core constraint: the rotated object's AABB must fit within the surface's boundaries. Since both are squares, I need to account for rotation.  I've efficiently calculated the 'effective' AABB dimensions based on rotation using `s_eff = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.  I recognize that symmetry helps: angles like 0 and pi/2, and pi/4 are relatively straightforward, and pi/6 and pi/3 are also symmetric pairs.
           
           The key to stability lies in calculating `max_c`, the maximum allowable offset from the center of the surface, which is `S_half - half_s_eff`.  To efficiently determine these, I pre-compute `s_eff` and  `half_s_eff` at key rotation angles (0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and pi/2).
           
           The core strategy is to choose a diverse set of rotations. Then, for each, I populate the available area within the calculated `max_c` region.  I'm focusing on a 5-angle strategy.
           
           For each angle, I generate 10 unique placements.  I use key locations for each: the origin, points along the axes (`max_c` distance), and points at `max_c/2` to distribute the objects in a balanced fashion. In order to get 10 placements,  I also include  a corner `0.75 * max_c, 0.75 * max_c` for each angle.
           
           I then translate these coordinates to the given object's ID and surface ID. With these calculations and translations, I can produce a set of stable placements.

(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for a Square Object on a Square Surface**
           
           I've been tasked with generating 50 stable placements for a square object of a specific size (`s = 0.09611190572439698`) onto a square surface.  Stability, in this context, means ensuring the object's rotated bounding box remains entirely within the surface's boundaries. The surface itself is a square centered at (0,0) with a half-width/height of 0.135, forming an AABB.
           
           To solve this, I've considered the geometry. A square rotated at an angle 'theta' has an effective width and height, `s_eff`, that changes. I used the formulas to calculate the allowed area for the object's center, (x, y), for various orientations. The goal is to maximize the diversity of placements.
           
           My strategy is to use a few distinct angles (0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and pi/2 radians) to get a good spread, and for each, I'll generate approximately 10 unique positions. Those positions include the center of the surface, corner and edge placements, and a few intermediate ones. This systematic approach ensures coverage and makes it easy to generate 50 unique placements.
           
           Specifically, I've calculated the maximum allowed offset from the center (`max_c`) for each angle, ensuring stability. I then set up coordinates for each angle using a predictable pattern. This provides a very diverse set of placements. I'm leveraging my knowledge of geometry to provide efficient and diverse results.

(Thoughts: **Stable Object Placements: A Comprehensive Approach**
           
           My goal is to determine 50 stable placements for a square object (side `s = 0.0961`) on a square surface (`((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`). The challenge is to account for object rotation and ensure the object remains entirely within the surface boundaries.
           
           First, I define the effective bounding box (AABB) of the object when rotated by an angle `theta`. The width and height of this rotated AABB are calculated as `s_eff = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. The half-width/height, `half_s_eff`, is then `s_eff / 2`. To guarantee stability, the object's center `(x, y)` must lie within the region defined by `-max_c <= x <= max_c` and `-max_c <= y <= max_c`, where `max_c = S_half - half_s_eff` and `S_half = 0.135` is the surface half-width/height.
           
           To achieve diverse orientations, I will utilize multiple rotation angles. I've selected `0`, `pi/6`, `pi/4`, `pi/3`, and `pi/2` radians. For each angle, I compute `max_c` and then strategically position the object's center within the allowable region.
           
           Here's my calculated plan for each angle:
           *   `theta = 0`:  `max_c = 0.0869`. I will generate points centered on a grid, corners and center.
           *   `theta = pi/6`: `max_c = 0.0693`. I will generate points centered on a grid, corners and center.
           *   `theta = pi/4`: `max_c = 0.0670`. I will generate points centered on a grid, corners and center.
           *   `theta = pi/3`: `max_c = 0.0693`. I will generate points centered on a grid, corners and center.
           *   `theta = pi/2`: `max_c = 0.0869`. I will generate points centered on a grid, corners and center.
           
           I will populate each grid with positions derived from the edge values of the rectangle at the calculated `max_c` values. I will calculate edge points, corner points, and a central point and use those as the placements. This methodical approach should yield a robust set of 50 stable object placements, covering various orientations and positions within the available surface area.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object ID 8**
           
           My task is to generate 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 8) on a square surface. The surface is defined by the AABB `0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`, with a half-width/height of `0.135`. The object is also a square with a side length of `0.09611190572439698`.
           
           To ensure stability, the object's rotated AABB must be fully contained within the surface's AABB.  I calculate the effective width and height (`s_eff`) of the rotated object's AABB using `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`, where `s` is the object's side length and `theta` is the rotation angle.  I then determine the half-dimensions of this effective AABB, `half_s_eff`, by dividing `s_eff` by 2.
           
           The object's center coordinates (x, y) must then fall within the range defined by `x_min_surface + half_s_eff <= x <= x_max_surface - half_s_eff` and  `y_min_surface + half_s_eff <= y <= y_max_surface - half_s_eff`. This translates to a range `[-max_c, max_c]` for both x and y, where `max_c = S_half - half_s_eff`.
           
           I've decided on a strategy using 5 different rotation angles: 0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and pi/2 radians.  For each angle, I calculate `max_c` and then generate 10 placements.
           
           The calculations are as follows (and I double-checked them!):
           *   For theta = 0 and pi/2, `max_c` equals `0.08694404713780151`.

           I will generate the placements using a fixed set of coordinates (center, 4 extremes, 4 corners, and 1 mid-quadrant) for each value of `max_c`.

The surface is defined by the AABB `0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`, with a half-width/height of `0.135`. The object is also a square with a side length of `0.09611190572439698`.
           
           To ensure stability, the object's rotated AABB must be fully contained within the surface's AABB.  I calculate the effective width and height (`s_eff`) of the rotated object's AABB using `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`, where `s` is the object's side length and `theta` is the rotation angle.  I then determine the half-dimensions of this effective AABB, `half_s_eff`, by dividing `s_eff` by 2.
           
           The object's center coordinates (x, y) must then fall within the range defined by `x_min_surface + half_s_eff <= x <= x_max_surface - half_s_eff` and  `y_min_surface + half_s_eff <= y <= y_max_surface - half_s_eff`. This translates to a range `[-max_c, max_c]` for both x and y, where `max_c = S_half - half_s_eff`.

           Okay, so I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 8) on a square surface. The surface is defined by corners at (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135). The object itself is a square with a side length of approximately 0.096.
           
           My approach will be methodical, focusing on rotation and ensuring stability. The key lies in understanding the object's effective dimensions as it rotates. For a square, the effective width and height after a rotation `theta` are given by `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This means the effective size changes with the rotation.  I'll calculate the allowed center positions to keep the whole AABB inside of the surface.
           
           I've decided to analyze five key rotation angles: 0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and pi/2.  I'll use these angles and generate placements.
           
           *   **Rotation = 0 radians:** This is straightforward. The object is aligned with the surface axes. I calculate the half effective size (`half_s_eff`) and then determine the maximum center position (`max_c`) where the object is still fully within the surface.
           *   **Rotation = pi/4 radians:**  This is a 45-degree rotation, and the AABB expands.  The diagonal dimension is crucial here. Again, I compute `half_s_eff` and `max_c`.
           *   **Rotation = pi/6 and pi/3:** These will have values between the other two cases.
           *   **Rotation = pi/2:** This is the same as the 0 radians case.
           
           I'll generate 10 placements per angle, systematically varying the object's center coordinates within the allowed range defined by `max_c`. These placements should be well-spaced and cover different positions within the allowed stable region for each angle. The plan is to have placements on all the corners.
           
           The process has been successful thus far; no non-fixed obstacles have been identified.  Therefore, I should be able to fulfill this request using this method.

These placements should be well-spaced and cover different positions within the allowed stable region for each angle. The plan is to have placements on all the corners.
           
           The process has been successful thus far; no non-fixed obstacles have been identified.  Therefore, I should be able to fulfill this request using this method.

(Thoughts: **Placement Optimization for a Square Object**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for a square object on a larger square surface. The surface dimensions are defined, with corners at (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135), and the object's side length `s` is 0.09611190572439698. The key is ensuring the rotated object's AABB stays completely within the surface's AABB.
           
           To handle rotations, I'm using the formula for the effective AABB dimensions (`s_eff_x`, `s_eff_y`) of a rotated square. For this square object, since it's a square, both will always be the same, so `s_eff`.
           I need to calculate the half of this AABB which I will denote `half_s_eff`.
           
           I know that to have stability, the object's center `(x, y)` needs to stay within a calculated region based on `half_s_eff` and the surface's dimensions. I need to calculate `max_c`, which will be the maximal boundary that will allow the object to be stable.
           
           I'm aiming to sample rotations across `[0, pi/2]` and calculate a `max_c` for each of them. I can reuse the `max_c` value for angles that are equivalent by symmetry. This includes  0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and pi/2. I know that rotating the object through the range [0,pi/2] is sufficient due to the symmetry of the AABB when rotating the object.
           
           I have already calculated that:
           *   At `theta = 0`, `max_c` is approximately 0.086944.
           *   At `theta = pi/4`, `max_c` is approximately 0.067049.
           *   At `theta = pi/6` and `theta = pi/3`, `max_c` is approximately 0.069375.
           *   At `theta = pi/2`, `max_c` is approximately 0.086944.
           
           For each rotation I'll place the square at 10 different coordinates, which should provide a good coverage. I will place it at (0,0) and around the origin, and then at (max_c/2, max_c/2).
           
           By combining these rotations and placement strategies, I'll generate the required 50 unique stable placements for the object.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Placing an Object:**
           
           My primary goal is to determine 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 8) with a side length of approximately 0.0961 on a larger square surface with corners at (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135).  Given my expertise, this problem breaks down into manageable steps:
           
           First, I need to account for the object's various orientations. I'll rotate the square object and will calculate the minimum bounding box for each rotation.  This requires determining the effective width and height of the object, which is based on its side length and the rotation angle.  Specifically, `W_eff = H_eff = s_obj * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.  Then, I'll calculate `half_s_eff`, which is the half-width and half-height, for each rotated position.
           
           The core of the solution is calculating valid center coordinates (x, y) that keep the object entirely within the surface.  For a stable placement, the center must satisfy  `S_half - half_s_eff >= x >= -(S_half - half_s_eff)` and the same for y. I'll use `max_c(theta)` to refer to `S_half - half_s_eff`.
           
           I will generate different placement options by defining 5 rotation angles and then selecting various (x, y) coordinates within the region permitted by the `max_c` value for each of those angles.
           The specific angles are 0, pi/12, pi/6, pi/4, and 1 radian.  I am selecting those so that each will produce a unique `max_c` value.
           
           For each rotation angle, I will select ten valid placement positions for the object's center coordinates. A valid coordinate system with respect to the center of the surface will give me a total of 50 different placement configurations.  These placements will include the center, corners, edges, and internal locations of the bounding box. The object's side length `s`, the surface's half dimension `S_half`,  and trigonometric functions for cosine and sine of the rotation angle are used in the calculations.  My careful approach will use precise calculations for each `max_c` and then round for the final output as needed.  This ensures I cover the entire allowable space.

(Thoughts: **My Placement Generation Strategy**
           
           I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 8, side length approximately 0.096) on a square surface (surface 0) of size 0.27 x 0.27 centered at the origin.  The core challenge lies in accounting for rotations of the object.  
           
           The maximum allowable displacement from the origin for the object's center varies depending on its rotation.  I need to determine this maximum displacement for a few key angles.
           
           First, I calculate the effective half-width/height of the rotated square. The general formula is `half_s_eff = (s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))) / 2`, where `s` is the side length and `theta` is the rotation angle.  Then I compute the maximum center coordinate `max_c = S_half - half_s_eff` where `S_half` is half the surface dimension (0.135).
           
           For the object at 0 degrees rotation, `max_c` is approximately 0.087. At 45 degrees, it’s about 0.067. For 30 and 60 degrees, it's about 0.069.
           
           To achieve diversity and meet the 50-placement requirement, I plan to use five rotations: 0, 30, 45, 60, and 90 degrees.  I'll generate 10 placements for each.  Since the object is square and all rotations are multiples of 90 degrees, and the object and the placement surface are of the same type, I'll repeat calculations for 90 degrees. I will then pick a distribution of placements within the feasible region defined by `[-max_c, max_c] x [-max_c, max_c]`. The general idea is to pick center points at (0,0), at the edges, at the corners, and the midpoint of the quadrants of `[-max_c, max_c] x [-max_c, max_c]`.

(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for a Square Object**
           
           Alright, I need to figure out 50 stable positions for this square object (ID 8) on a larger square surface. The surface dimensions are defined, and the object's dimensions are also given. My approach is to ensure the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) when rotated stays completely within the surface boundaries.
           
           I'm using the standard method: calculate the effective side length of the rotated object's AABB (`s_eff`) based on the rotation angle (`theta`).  Then, I'll determine the maximum allowable coordinate offset (`max_c`) for the object's center, ensuring the object doesn't spill out of the surface.
           
           I've decided to vary the rotation angles to get a good spread: 0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and pi/2 radians.  For each angle, I calculated the appropriate `max_c`.  For theta = 0, the safe placement region extends further than the other angles, due to the diagonal and other angles "cutting" the region short.
           
           To generate the 50 placements, I'll take a grid approach:  for each rotation, I'll use the origin (0,0), the four corners of the `max_c` square, the four midpoints of the square's edges, and one point in the interior (max_c/2, max_c/2).  This produces ten valid placements for each rotation.
           
           So, I'll generate the precise coordinates for each of those 50 positions and apply the corresponding rotations to the object. I'm going to start by performing these calculations and building the lists of placements.  These coordinates and rotations should provide a stable distribution of placements. This will give the desired 50 unique placements.

My goal is to ensure that the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) remains *entirely* within the surface's boundaries after rotation.
           
           I know the effective side length of the AABB depends on the rotation angle `theta`: `s_eff(theta) = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This means the maximum offset allowed for the object's center from the surface's origin changes with `theta`. Specifically, I need to find the `max_c(theta) = S_half - half_s_eff(theta)`, where `S_half = 0.135`. The object's center `(x, y)` has to satisfy `-max_c(theta) <= x <= max_c(theta)` and `-max_c(theta) <= y <= max_c(theta)`.
           
           To ensure diversity, I'll use 5 different rotation angles: `0`, `pi/6`, `pi/4`, `pi/3`, and `pi/2`. I've calculated the `max_c` for each of these angles. This lets me determine the maximum allowed offset from the origin for each `theta`.

(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 8**
           
           Okay, so I need to generate 50 stable placements for object ID 8 on surface 0.  This is straightforward. The surface is a square AABB defined as `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`, and the object is also a square with a side length `s = 0.09611190572439698`.
           
           The core constraint is ensuring the object's rotated AABB is fully contained within the surface.  Since the object is a square, I know that for a rotation `theta`, the effective side length `s_eff` is `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This means I need to calculate `half_s_eff = s_eff / 2` and then determine the valid center coordinates `(x, y)` for the object. The constraints on `(x, y)` are based on the surface dimensions, specifically: `-max_c <= x <= max_c` and `-max_c <= y <= max_c`, where `max_c = S_half - half_s_eff` and `S_half = 0.135`.
           
           To generate a diverse set of placements, I'll use a few different angles and then, for each angle, generate multiple positions within the valid area.
           
           Given `s = 0.09611190572439698`, and `S_half = 0.135`, I've pre-calculated some useful values for `max_c`:
           
           *   For `theta = 0` (and multiples of pi/2), `max_c = 0.08694404713780151`
           *   For `theta = pi/4` (and multiples thereof), `max_c = 0.06704903815009076`
           *   For `theta = pi/6` (and 5pi/6), `max_c = 0.06937454080981576`
           *   For `theta = pi/3` (and 2pi/3), `max_c = 0.06937454080981576`
           
           I'll use the angles `0`, `pi/6`, `pi/4`, `pi/3`, and `pi/2`.  For each angle, I will generate 10 positions, giving me the requested 50 placements. I'll arrange the positions in a regular pattern so that the placements are as evenly spread out as possible.
           
           Specifically, the positions will be:
           
           1.  Center (0,0)
           2.  Positive X extreme (`max_c`, 0)
           3.  Negative X extreme (`-max_c`, 0)
           4.  Positive Y extreme (0, `max_c`)
           5.  Negative Y extreme (0, `-max_c`)
           6.  Top-right corner (`max_c`, `max_c`)
           7.  Bottom-left corner (`-max_c`, `-max_c`)
           8.  Top-left corner (`-max_c`, `max_c`)
           9.  Bottom-right corner (`max_c`, `-max_c`)
           10. One intermediate point, e.g., (`max_c`/2, `max_c`/2)
           
           I have all the numbers I need. Now, it's just a matter of applying these values to generate the final list of object placements!

(Thoughts: **Stable and Diverse Placement Strategy for Object ID 8**
           
           I'm revisiting the request to place object ID 8, a square of side length 0.09611..., onto surface 0, which is a square AABB defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I need to ensure 50 stable and diverse placements. Since I've tackled this before, I'll leverage the previously calculated maximum center coordinates (`max_c`) for various rotation angles.
           
           The key is to calculate `max_c` accurately for a few key angles. First, `max_c` depends on the object's effective side length, `s_eff`, which changes with rotation, and is given by `s_eff = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. We then calculate the half the effective side length, `half_s_eff = s_eff / 2`, which is subtracted from the surface half-width/height (`0.135`) to give us `max_c`.
           
           Let's recalculate `max_c` for:
           1.  **0 degrees:** `max_c = 0.086944`
           2.  **45 degrees:** `max_c = 0.067049`
           3.  **30 degrees:** `max_c = 0.069375`
           4.  **60 degrees:** Same as 30 degrees.
           5.  **90 degrees:** `max_c` will be the same as 0 degrees.
           
           With these `max_c` values in hand, I'll generate the 50 placements. I'll focus on these five angles for rotation.
           
           For each angle, I'll create 10 distinct positions.  I'll position the object at the center, in each corner, in the middle of each edge, and one more in the middle of a quadrant.  For a given rotation angle, the allowable coordinate range for the object's center is `[-max_c, max_c]`.
           
           This ensures I'm covering a range of rotations and positions for maximum stability and diversity.

(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Stable Object Positions**
           
           Okay, so I'm dealing with a square object (ID 8) of a specific size (s = 0.09611190572439698) and a square surface defined by the corners  ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). My task is to find 50 stable placements for the object on this surface.
           
           My main concern is the object's rotation. I'll need to calculate the effective bounding box (AABB) of the object when rotated by an angle *theta*.  For a square, the effective width and height of the AABB is  `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. I'm calling that *s_eff*.  The half-dimension will be `half_s_eff = s_eff / 2`. The surface's half-dimension is `S_half = 0.135`.
           
           For a stable placement, I need the object's center (x, y) to be within a certain boundary. Specifically,  `x` and `y` must be within `-max_c` and `max_c`,  where `max_c = S_half - half_s_eff`.
           
           To generate 50 unique placements, I'll pick several distinct rotation angles and, for each, determine the corresponding `max_c` value. Then, within the valid x, y region, I'll strategically position the object.
           
           I've calculated `max_c` for rotations of 0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and pi/2 radians.  I can get 10 placements per angle.
           
           For each rotation I can place the object at:
           
           1.  Center
           2.  Edges: + and - max_c
           3.  Corners
           4.  A mid-quadrant.
           
           That should yield 50 well-distributed and distinct positions.

(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for a Square Object**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out how to place this square object 50 times on a square surface.  The surface is defined by corners at (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135), and the object is a square with side length `s = 0.09611190572439698`.  The trick here is to calculate the effective AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of the *rotated* object, so I can make sure it actually *fits* on the surface.
           
           For a square, the effective width and height after rotation are the same: `s_eff = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`, where `theta` is the rotation angle.  The half-dimension of that AABB is simply `half_s_eff = s_eff / 2`.  The half-width/height of the surface itself is `S_half = 0.135`.
           
           To make sure a placement is stable (i.e., the object is *fully* within the surface), the object's center `(x, y)` has to be within a certain range:
           
           `x_min_surface + half_s_eff <= x <= x_max_surface - half_s_eff`
           `y_min_surface + half_s_eff <= y <= y_max_surface - half_s_eff`
           
           Since the surface is centered at the origin, I can express that range more simply as `[-max_c, max_c] x [-max_c, max_c]`, where `max_c = S_half - half_s_eff`.
           
           Now, the main idea is to select several different rotation angles to get a diverse set of placements. I'll pick 5 distinct angles, and for each angle, I'll spread the object's center around that allowed region. This should give me a good variety of positions.
           
           Let me define `max_c` more formally: `max_c(theta) = 0.135 - (s / 2) * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.
           
           Here are some specific examples for `max_c`:
           
           1.  For `theta = 0` (or multiples of pi/2),  `half_s_eff = s / 2 = 0.04805595286219849`.  So, `max_c_0 = 0.135 - 0.04805595286219849 = 0.08694404713780151`.
           2.  For `theta = pi/4` (or multiples of pi/4),  `half_s_eff = s / sqrt(2) = 0.06795096184990924`.  Then, `max_c_pi_4 = 0.135 - 0.06795096184990924 = 0.06704903815009076`.
           3.  For `theta = pi/6` (and corresponding angles), `half_s_eff = (s / 2) * (cos(pi/6) + sin(pi/6)) = 0.06562545919018424`.  Thus, `max_c_pi_6 = 0.135 - 0.06562545919018424 = 0.06937454080981576`.
           
           I will be using `0`, `pi/6`, `pi/4`, `pi/3`, and `pi/2` as my rotation angles, and for each rotation angle I'll spread the placements around that `[-max_c, max_c] x [-max_c, max_c]` box. I'll generate 10 unique positions per angle by spacing out the object evenly throughout that space. This means I'll have a good spread over the entire surface, ensuring that I have 50 unique stable placements.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation Strategy for a Square Object**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The task is to find 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 8) on a square surface.  The key is to consider the object's rotation.  Since the object is square, we really only need to cover a rotation range of 0 to π/2 to capture all possible orientations.  We need to calculate the effective bounding box dimensions (AABB) of the *rotated* object, based on the rotation angle (θ), to define the valid placement area on the surface.
           
           First, I need to calculate the value of max_c for different angles.  max_c is the distance I can move from the center. I'll use a set of evenly spaced rotations.
           I'll use a set of five equally spaced angles across the relevant range: 0, π/6, π/4, π/3, and π/2.  I calculated max_c (the allowed boundary) for each angle. Then I will distribute the 50 points evenly among the 5 angles using a 3x3 grid centered in the max_c range. This strategy seems efficient.

(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Placing Object ID 8**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with finding 50 stable positions for object ID 8, which is a square, on surface 0, also a square. I need to make sure these placements are robust and unique.
           
           First, I need to account for rotation. A rotating square's effective footprint changes, so I calculate the effective side length (`s_eff`) of the square at different rotation angles (`theta`). This depends on the original side length (`s = 0.0961...`) and the surface's half-width (`S_half = 0.135`). The constraint is that the object's center must be within a safe zone, based on the `s_eff`.
           
           I plan to use 5 distinct rotation angles: `0`, `pi/6`, `pi/4`, `pi/3`, and `pi/2`. For each angle, I will generate 10 unique positions using the calculated `max_c` value, which defines the region in which the object's center can safely reside. The general pattern is `-max_c <= x <= max_c` and `-max_c <= y <= max_c`. I calculated the `max_c` values for the angles listed above and they are listed in the earlier section of the prompt.
           
           To ensure uniqueness and distribution, I'll place the object at the center, on the four edges and corners of the safe zone. This should guarantee 10 unique positions within each calculated `max_c` region.
           
           With that approach, I should be able to deliver 50 distinct and stable placements.

           Okay, so I need to generate 50 stable placements for a square object on a square surface. The surface dimensions are defined, and the object's size is given.  My approach is to find valid centers for the object by considering how the object's rotation affects its bounding box.
           
           First, I calculate the effective half-width/height (`half_s_eff`) of the rotated object's bounding box for several key rotation angles (0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, pi/2).  This is based on the formula `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))` for the effective side length. For each angle, I then determine the maximum valid offset (`max_c`) from the origin, which is `S_half - half_s_eff`.
           
           I'm thinking I'll use 5 key rotation angles (0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, pi/2) to give a decent diversity of orientations.  For each angle, I'll generate 10 unique positions (x, y) for the object's center. This will result in the 50 placements I need.
           
           My position strategy involves using the origin (0,0) as a starting point. Then, I'll place the object at the edges of the allowed region by placing the object at the corners (max_c, max_c), (-max_c, max_c), (max_c, -max_c), (-max_c, -max_c). I'll also add another point (+max_c/2, +max_c/2) to the group.  Then repeat for all orientations.
           
           This method ensures diverse coverage within the valid placement area for each rotation, maximizing the chance of finding unique stable positions.

Stability hinges on ensuring the object's rotated AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) remains entirely within the surface. The effective side length `s_eff` of the rotated AABB is `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. We then calculate `half_s_eff = s_eff / 2`. To maintain stability, the object's center `(x, y)` must fall within a square defined by `-max_c <= x, y <= max_c`, where `max_c = S_half - half_s_eff`.
           
           My plan is to choose a few distinct rotation angles and, for each, generate multiple `(x, y)` coordinates within the allowable square. I've selected the following key angles: `0`, `pi/6`, `pi/4`, `pi/3`, and `pi/2`. For each angle, I will generate 10 positions. This should offer a good variety and ensure complete coverage.
           
           First, I need to compute the `max_c` values for each of these angles.  I've already done these calculations and I know that:
           
           *   For `theta = 0` (and `pi/2` because of the symmetry), `max_c_0 = max_c_pi_2 = 0.0869`.  This gives us an x-range and y-range of [-0.0869, 0.0869].
           *   For `theta = pi/4`, `max_c_pi_4 = 0.0670`.  The x and y ranges are [-0.0670, 0.0670].
           *   `theta = pi/6` (and `pi/3` because of symmetry): `max_c_pi_6 = max_c_pi_3 = 0.0694`. Ranges are [-0.0694, 0.0694].
           
           Now, for each angle, I will generate the 10 placements.  I'll start with the center point (0, 0), then the extremes along the axes (positive and negative), the corners of the allowable square, and finally, the center of each of the four quadrants.
           
           With this structure in place, I am confident that I can develop a diverse set of placements. This will give the desired 50 distinct positions and provide comprehensive coverage of the surface.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for a Square Object**
           
           Okay, so I'm being asked to figure out 50 stable placements for this square object on a square surface.  The key is to avoid any overlap between the rotated object's bounding box and the surface boundaries.  Since the surface is symmetrical and centered at the origin, the math simplifies nicely.
           
           I've got a formula to calculate the effective bounding box of the square after it's been rotated by an angle, `theta`.  It's just the object side length multiplied by the sum of the absolute values of the sine and cosine of `theta`. This gives me the rotated AABB, which I can then use to figure out the maximum allowable center coordinates (`max_c`) for the object's placement on the surface, ensuring it stays within the bounds.
           
           My plan is this: I'll pick a few key angles – 0, π/6, π/4, π/3, and π/2.  I’ve chosen these specifically because of the symmetry of the square and the fact that I can then leverage these calculations across rotations. Then, for each angle, I'll generate a set of 10 well-distributed placement coordinates within the allowable region.
           
           For each angle, I will use a series of offsets, including the surface center, the corners of the safe region, and points along the edges and within. With this distribution strategy, I'll generate 50 unique placements to satisfy the request. I've worked out `max_c` for each angle, and the offsets for the distributions, all in anticipation of the solution.

(Thoughts: **Stable Object Placements: A Refined Approach**
           
           Okay, I'm tasked with devising 50 stable placements for object ID 8 on a square surface.  The surface is a 0.27x0.27 meter square centered at the origin, and the object is a smaller 0.096x0.096 meter square.  My primary constraint is to ensure the object's center remains within the surface, considering its rotation.
           
           I know I need to calculate the effective size of the object, `half_s_eff`, based on its rotation angle (`theta`).  This is done using the formula `(s / 2) * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.  The maximum allowable distance from the origin (`max_c`) for the object's center is then determined by subtracting this effective size from half the surface's size (0.135 meters).
           
           To generate a diverse set of placements, I'll strategically choose rotation angles and then define positions relative to those angles. For this round, the angles selected are 0.0, pi/8, pi/5, pi/3, and 3*pi/8.
           
           I've calculated `max_c` for each of these angles. I will choose 10 unique positions for each angle for the 50 required.  I will be utilizing (0,0), and four points at each of the max boundaries of x and y and half, and one-third max.
           
           This should generate unique placements different from previous attempts and ensure the generated coordinates are within surface constraints.

(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Stable Object Positions**
           
           Okay, so I'm dealing with a request for 50 stable placements of a square object (ID 8, side `s = 0.0961`) on a larger square surface centered at the origin with corners at `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. My approach is to take into account how rotations affect the object's effective bounding box. For a square, the effective width/height (`s_eff`) changes with rotation angle `theta` as: `s_eff = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This means I need to calculate the maximum allowable center coordinates (`max_c`) for each rotation to ensure the entire rotated object stays within the surface.
           
           I've determined that the `max_c` calculation simplifies to `0.135 - half_s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`, where `half_s` is simply `s / 2`. Given the symmetry of a square, I can cover the full range of stable rotations by considering angles from 0 to π/4, then extending to π/2 to get a good coverage of effective AABB sizes.
           
           I've selected key angles: `0`, `π/12`, `π/6`, `π/4`, and used symmetry to include `π/3`. Then I've calculated the corresponding `max_c` values for each angle. Now, I will generate a set of positions around each center by using the bounds of `[-max_c, max_c] x [-max_c, max_c]`. For each angle, 10 placements will be created. I'm choosing the following distinct positions: the center, offsets from the center by `max_c` in each cardinal direction, diagonal offsets by `max_c`, and a center point, as listed in the previous section.
           
           This results in a total of 50 distinct, stable placements for the object across different rotations. That satisfies the request.

           First, I need to consider how rotation affects the object's effective AABB.  I'll calculate the effective side (`s_eff`) of the object's bounding box for various rotations (`theta`).  The formula is: `s_eff = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. Then, I'll find half of this effective side, `half_s_eff = s_eff / 2`.
           
           To maintain stability, the object's center `(x, y)` needs to stay within the following bounds, given `S_half = 0.135`:
           
           `- (S_half - half_s_eff) <= x <= (S_half - half_s_eff)`
           `- (S_half - half_s_eff) <= y <= (S_half - half_s_eff)`

           I'll pick a diverse set of angles. For each angle, I calculate `max_c` and then I'll create a set of coordinates within the allowable range for *x* and *y*.

           Okay, so I need to generate 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 8, side length approximately 0.096) on a square surface (surface 0, half-side length 0.135).  Since the surface is centered at the origin, the problem simplifies a bit.
           
           First, I'm defining the key parameters: `s_obj` as the object's side length and `s_surf` as the surface's half-side length. Then, I need to consider the effective AABB of the *rotated* object.  The effective half-width and half-height for a square are calculated as  `(s_obj / 2) * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`, where `theta` is the rotation angle.  My placement algorithm needs to ensure that the center coordinates (x, y) of the object satisfy the following constraints within the surface's boundaries:  `s_surf - half_s_eff >= x >= -s_surf + half_s_eff` and `s_surf - half_s_eff >= y >= -s_surf + half_s_eff`.
           
           I'm thinking of pre-calculating the maximum allowed offset (`max_c = s_surf - half_s_eff`) for a few key rotation angles: 0, pi/4, pi/6, pi/3, and pi/2. This will give me a good understanding of the available placement space for different rotations.
           
           My strategy is to pick 5 rotation angles: 0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and pi/2. For each angle, I'll generate 10 (x, y) coordinates within the allowed range defined by `max_c`. This should give me 50 unique placements.  Specifically, for each angle I will pick the center, the four corners, the midpoints of the boundaries, and the midpoint within the first quadrant (max_c/2, max_c/2).  Since the formula for calculating `max_c` is symetrical, pi/6 is the same as pi/3, and 0 is the same as pi/2.

           My strategy is to pick 5 rotation angles: 0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and pi/2. For each angle, I'll generate 10 (x, y) coordinates within the allowed range defined by `max_c`. This should give me 50 unique placements.  Specifically, for each angle I will pick the center, the four corners, the midpoints of the boundaries, and the midpoint within the first quadrant (max_c/2, max_c/2).  Since the formula for calculating `max_c` is symetrical, pi/6 is the same as pi/3, and 0 is the same as pi/2.

(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for a Square Object**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID: 8, side length `s = 0.0961`) on a square surface with corners at `(-0.135, -0.135)` and `(0.135, 0.135)`.  This is about finding the possible ranges of coordinates for the object's center, while accounting for rotation and surface limits.
           
           First, I've got to consider the rotated object's AABB. The effective side length `s_eff` of that AABB depends on the rotation angle `theta` and is given by `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. The half-dimension, then, is `half_s_eff = s_eff / 2`.  For stability, the object's center must stay within the surface, or `S_half - half_s_eff`, where `S_half` is the surface's half-width/height. Because both the object and the surface are square, and both are centered at (0,0), it simplifies to using the condition, `max_c = S_half - half_s_eff`.
           
           I'll generate the 50 placements by varying `theta` and `(x, y)` coordinates.  I've pre-calculated several `max_c` values corresponding to angles: 0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and pi/2. These give `max_c` values of `0.0869`, `0.0694`, `0.0670`, `0.0694`, and `0.0869`.
           
           For each rotation angle, I'll generate a set of points:
            - Center: (0, 0)
            - Mid-Edges: (mc, 0), (-mc, 0), (0, mc), (0, -mc)
            - Corners: (mc, mc), (mc, -mc), (-mc, mc), (-mc, -mc)
            - Inside: (mc/2, mc/2)
           This produces the 10 placements needed for each value of theta, totalling 50.

(Thoughts: **My Plan for Generating Stable Placements**
           
           Okay, so I need to generate 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 8) on a square surface (surface 0).  The surface is a square AABB of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`, and the object is a square of size `0.09611190572439698`.  The key constraint here is that the object needs to be fully contained within the surface to be considered stable.
           
           First, I'll calculate the crucial parameters. The surface's half-width/height is `0.135`, and the object's half-side is `0.04805595286219849`.  The effective half-width/height (`half_s_eff`) of a *rotated* square object's AABB depends on its rotation angle (`theta`): `half_s_eff = (s_obj / 2) * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This means the maximum center coordinate (`max_c`) for the object's stable placement within the surface is `S_half - half_s_eff`.
           
           I'll choose five distinct rotation angles: `0`, `pi/6`, `pi/4`, `pi/3`, and `pi/2`.  For each angle, I need to compute the corresponding `max_c` and then generate a set of `(x, y)` coordinates for the object's center.
           
           Here's the breakdown of my `max_c` calculations:
           
           *   **`theta = 0` (and `pi/2`)**:  `max_c = 0.135 - (0.04805595286219849 * 1) = 0.08694404713780151`
           *   **`theta = pi/4`**:  `max_c = 0.135 - (0.04805595286219849 * 1.41421356237) = 0.06704903815009076`
           *   **`theta = pi/6` (and `pi/3`)**:  `max_c = 0.135 - (0.04805595286219849 * 1.3660254037844386) = 0.06937454080981576`
           
           For each angle, I'll generate ten placements:
           
           1.  Center at (0, 0)
           2.  Four points at the midpoints of the edges.
           3.  Four points at the corners.
           4.  One point in the center of the available space.
           
           These sets should yield 50 distinct object placements. While some `max_c` values may be the same for different angles, the rotation angle itself will differ, fulfilling the original requirement.

           Okay, so I need to generate 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 8) on a square surface (surface 0).  The surface is a square AABB of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`, and the object is a square of size `0.09611190572439698`.

This means the maximum center coordinate (`max_c`) for the object's stable placement within the surface is `S_half - half_s_eff`.

(Thoughts: **My Approach to Generating Stable Object Placements**
           
           Okay, I've got a new task: place object ID 8, a square with side `s = 0.09611`, onto surface 0, a square with half-width/height `S_half = 0.135`.  I need to provide 50 stable placements, meaning the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) remains within the surface's boundaries after rotation.
           
           My strategy is to generate a diverse set of placements by focusing on different rotation angles and corresponding placement coordinates.  First, I'll calculate `max_c(theta)`, which defines the boundary within which the object's center can lie for a given rotation `theta`.  This boundary is simply `S_half - half_s_eff(theta)`, where `s_eff(theta)` is the effective side length of the rotated object's AABB: `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.
           
           I've determined key `max_c` values:
           *   At `theta = 0` (and `pi/2`, `pi`, `3pi/2`), `max_c = 0.08694`.
           *   At `theta = pi/4` (and `3pi/4`, etc.), `max_c = 0.06705`.
           *   At `theta = pi/6` (and `pi/3`), `max_c = 0.06937`.
           
           I'll use five different angles for diverse placement: `0`, `pi/6`, `pi/4`, `pi/3`, and `pi/2`.  For each, I'll generate ten distinct (x, y) coordinates within the calculated `max_c` boundary.  The chosen coordinates will ensure the coverage of critical points within that boundary.  For instance, they will include the center (0, 0), extremes along axes, corners and intermediate points.
           
           This approach should give me a well-distributed set of 50 stable placements. I will then present the final list of coordinates and corresponding rotation angles as my solution.

           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (side length 0.09611) on a square surface centered at the origin, with sides of length 0.27 (0.135 half-width/height). Stability means the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) when rotated remains entirely within the surface's boundaries.
           
           My approach is to consider a diverse set of rotation angles and calculate the maximum allowable offset from the origin (`max_c`) for the object's center, ensuring the rotated AABB fits within the surface. The effective side length (`s_eff`) of the rotated object is determined by its original side length (`s`) and the absolute values of the cosine and sine of the rotation angle (`theta`): `s_eff = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. The half-dimension of the effective AABB then becomes `half_s_eff = s_eff / 2`. The maximum allowable offset is then calculated as `max_c = S_half - half_s_eff`, where `S_half` is the surface's half-width/height.
           
           I've selected the following angles to consider for rotation and stability: `0`, `pi/12`, `pi/6`, `pi/4`, and `pi/3` radians, giving me a range of potential orientations. For each angle, I calculated the corresponding `max_c` value:

The half-dimension of the effective AABB then becomes `half_s_eff = s_eff / 2`. The maximum allowable offset is then calculated as `max_c = S_half - half_s_eff`, where `S_half` is the surface's half-width/height.

(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements for a Square Object**
           
           Okay, so I've got this square object (ID 8) with side length `s_obj = 0.09611190572439698`, and I need to find 50 stable placements for it on a square surface (surface 0) with half-side length `S_surf = 0.135`. Stability here means the object's rotated AABB must be fully contained within the surface.  This isn't rocket science, but I need to be precise.
           
           I know the effective side length, `s_eff`, of the rotated AABB depends on the rotation angle `theta`: `s_eff(theta) = s_obj * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This means the center of the object, `(x, y)`, must satisfy some constraints:  `-max_c(theta) <= x <= max_c(theta)` and `-max_c(theta) <= y <= max_c(theta)`, where `max_c(theta) = S_surf - half_s_eff(theta)`.
           
           To get variety, I'm going to pick a few rotation angles and generate multiple positions within the allowed ranges. I'll stick to a few key angles: 0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and pi/2.  I've already calculated the corresponding `max_c` values:
           
           *   `theta = 0`: `max_c = 0.08694404713780151`
           *   `theta = pi/6`: `max_c = 0.06937454080981576`
           *   `theta = pi/4`: `max_c = 0.06704903815009076`
           *   `theta = pi/3`: `max_c = 0.06937454080981576` (same as pi/6)
           *   `theta = pi/2`: `max_c = 0.08694404713780151` (same as 0)
           
           For each angle, I'll generate 10 unique placements.  I'm going to keep it simple:  a center placement, placements along each axis at the `max_c` boundary, placements at the corners, and one in a "mid-quadrant" position (halfway towards the corner).  That'll give me a good spread.  This approach leverages the symmetry of the problem and should guarantee a set of stable and diverse placement points. It's a clean and efficient way to satisfy the requirement of 50 placements.  I'm satisfied with this approach.

(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Stable Object Positions**
           
           Okay, I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 8, side 0.0961) on a square surface (0.27 x 0.27, centered at origin). The object's rotations are key here. To ensure stability, I need to consider the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) after rotation.
           
           The effective side length of the AABB depends on the rotation angle.  I know that  `s_eff(theta) = s_obj * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This means at 0 or 90 degrees (or multiples thereof), the effective size is the same as the original side length, which is `half_s_eff = 0.04805`.  At 45 degrees, it increases to roughly 1.414 times that.  At 30 or 60 degrees, it increases by ~1.36.
           
           The object's center must stay within the region where it's fully contained within the surface. The maximum x and y coordinates are `S_surf - half_s_eff(theta)`, which is the important constraint.  I'll call this `max_c`.
           
           To get a diverse set of placements, I'll use 5 different angles: 0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and pi/2. This will ensure I have a reasonable variety of orientations to work with. For each angle I will generate positions.
           
           With a good scheme I have found 10 positions for each orientation by using the mid-point between the corners and the center. The placements will vary between the maximum coordinates.
           My plan: generate 10 placements for each of the 5 angles, resulting in 50 total.
           This ensures diverse positions in the surface while the object remains stable.

(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Square Object on a Square Surface**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements of a square object on a square surface. The surface is defined by bounds `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))` and the object has a side length `s = 0.09611190572439698`.  My strategy involves calculating the effective bounding box (AABB) of the rotated object and then placing its center within the feasible region.
           
           The key to this is understanding how rotation affects the object's footprint.  I'm using the formula `W_eff = H_eff = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))` for the effective width/height of the AABB based on the rotation `theta`.  This means the feasible region for the object's center will be a smaller square.  My aim is to cover a range of these "feasible region" sizes by picking different rotation angles.
           
           To calculate the available space, I start with `max_c = S_half - half_s_eff`, where `S_half = 0.135` is half the surface dimension, and `half_s_eff = s_eff / 2`. The relevant rotation angles I'm using are 0, pi/12, pi/6, pi/4, and pi/3, which will give me a good spread.  I've already calculated `max_c` for each of those angles.
           
           To ensure diversity of placements, I'll generate ten distinct positions for each angle of rotation. I'll include the origin, the axes, all four corners, and a midpoint within the bounded "safe" area for that rotation.
           
           This method gives me a mix of orientations and locations, and fulfills the user's request for 50 placements.

           Alright, I've got a clear plan here. The user needs 50 stable placements for a square object on a square surface. The key is to ensure the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) when rotated is fully contained within the surface. I know the surface bounds, and the object's side length.
           
           First, I need to calculate the effective AABB dimensions for various rotations.  I know the formula: `s_eff = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This allows me to figure out how much space the object will take up depending on the rotation angle. Then, I need to compute `max_c`, which represents the maximum distance the object's center can be from the origin along either axis while still being stable.  `max_c = S_half - half_s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`, where `S_half` is the half-dimension of the surface.
           
           I'm going to pick a set of representative rotation angles to get a good range of bounding box sizes. I've chosen `0`, `pi/6`, `pi/4`, `pi/3`, and `pi/2`.  For each angle, I will determine the corresponding `max_c` value. With the `max_c` I then calculated the placement for 10 positions for each angle: one center, the four corners, four midpoints, and one intermediate point.
           
           For the `theta = 0` and `pi/2` angles, where the object is aligned with the axes, I can maximize the allowed placement area. For `theta = pi/4`, it makes sense to go in between corners with a diagonal. Similarly, `pi/3` and `pi/6` will give us different maximal center placements.
           
           I am generating 10 positions in the x-y plane, that should be all placements, for the requested 50, in a way that should fulfill the requirement of stability!

           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID: 8, side `s = 0.09611`) on a square surface (surface 0) defined by the AABB `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I know a placement is stable if the rotated object's AABB is fully contained within the surface's AABB.
           
           To achieve this, I'll calculate the `max_c` value for different rotation angles (`theta`). This `max_c` defines the maximum allowable offset from the origin for the object's center `(x, y)`. The object's AABB dimensions change with rotation, so `max_c` varies with `theta`.
           
           Given the object's side length `s`, I first calculate `half_s = s / 2`. Then, for a given `theta`, `max_c` is calculated as `0.135 - half_s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. I've already determined `max_c` for several key angles: 0, pi/4, pi/6, and pi/12.
           
           Now, to get 50 placements, I'll use 5 different rotation angles: 0, pi/12, pi/6, pi/4, and pi/3. For each angle I'll generate 10 positions: the origin, 4 positions on each of the axes, 4 positions at the corners, and one in the middle of a quadrant. I will carefully ensure that each position remains within the `max_c` for its corresponding `theta` value. This way, I should generate 50 unique, valid placements.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Square Objects**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object on a square surface. The surface is a 0.27-unit square centered at the origin, and the object is a 0.096-unit square. My primary concern is stability, which means the object's rotated bounding box must stay within the surface's bounds.
           
           To figure this out, I'm leveraging the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) concept. I know that rotating a square affects its effective width and height. For any rotation angle `theta`, the effective side length of the AABB is `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`, where `s` is the original side length.  This means I need to calculate the maximum allowed center position for the object to ensure it stays within the surface, taking into account the rotation.
           
           I've calculated the maximum allowed center offset for several key angles: 0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and pi/2.  I'm aiming for diversity in the placements, so I plan to use these 5 angles.  This gives me 10 placements per angle.
           
           For each angle, I'll generate a set of evenly spaced (x, y) coordinates within the calculated maximum allowed offset. I will begin by generating the following locations for each angle:
           (0,0), (+/- max_c, 0), (0, +/- max_c), (+/- max_c, +/- max_c), (+/- max_c/2, +/- max_c/2).
           
           Since there are no existing object placements yet, I don't need to worry about collision checks this time around.

           I've calculated the maximum allowed center offset for several key angles: 0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and pi/2.  I'm aiming for diversity in the placements, so I plan to use these 5 angles.  This gives me 10 placements per angle.
           
           For each angle, I'll generate a set of evenly spaced (x, y) coordinates within the calculated maximum allowed offset. I will begin by generating the following locations for each angle:
           (0,0), (+/- max_c, 0), (0, +/- max_c), (+/- max_c, +/- max_c), (+/- max_c/2, +/- max_c/2).
           
           Since there are no existing object placements yet, I don't need to worry about collision checks this time around.

(Thoughts: **My Approach to Generating Stable Object Placements**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with finding 50 stable positions for a square object (ID 8, side length `s = 0.0961`) on a larger square surface (surface 0, centered at the origin, with extents `[-0.135, 0.135]`). The key here is "stable," meaning the rotated bounding box of the object must fit entirely within the surface's boundaries.
           
           I know the maximum allowable shift for the object's center depends on its rotation. For a square, I can quickly calculate the effective AABB (also square) dimensions: `s_eff = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This means at 0 or 90 degrees, it takes up the full length. At 45 degrees, the effective side length is `s * sqrt(2)`. The "stable" space is defined by `S_half - half_s_eff`.
           
           My strategy is to leverage several distinct rotation angles and, for each, generate multiple `(x, y)` coordinates within the calculated stable space. After thinking it through, I decide to use the following angles: 0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and pi/2. I'll take advantage of the symmetry of the square to determine `max_c`, for each angle, allowing me to compute my working range.
           
           Let's do the calculations:
           *   **0 & pi/2:** Effective AABB side length is `s`.  Therefore `max_c = 0.0869`.
           *   **pi/4:** Effective AABB side length is `s * sqrt(2)`. Therefore `max_c = 0.067`.
           *   **pi/6 & pi/3:** Effective AABB side length is ~ 0.065`. Therefore `max_c = 0.069`.
           
           For each rotation I'm going to create about 10 placements using a set pattern, this way I'm sure to hit the range, which will be the positions:
           1.  Center (`0, 0`)
           2.  `(+max_c, 0)` and `(-max_c, 0)`
           3.  `(0, +max_c)` and `(0, -max_c)`
           4.  `(+max_c, +max_c)` and `(-max_c, -max_c)` and `(+max_c, -max_c)` and `(-max_c, +max_c)`
           5.  Half way between (`max_c/2`, `max_c/2`)
           
           With this, I have a good plan to create my stable placements.

(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for a Square Object on a Square Surface**
           
           I've been tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 8) on a square surface (surface 0). The object has a side length of `s = 0.09611190572439698`, and the surface is a square of extents `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`, centered at the origin, with a half-dimension of `S_half = 0.135`.
           
           To ensure stability, the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) when rotated by an angle `theta` must fit entirely within the surface bounds.  For a square object, the effective side length of the AABB is `s_eff = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This means the center of the rotated object must lie within a smaller square centered at the origin.
           
           I need to calculate the safe region for the object's center. The formula `half_s_eff = s_eff / 2` is used for determining the half-dimension of the effective AABB.  The permissible range for the center coordinates `(x, y)` simplifies to `-max_c <= x <= max_c` and `-max_c <= y <= max_c`, where `max_c = S_half - half_s_eff`.
           
           I've pre-calculated `half_s = s / 2 = 0.04805595286219849`.  The function `max_c` now becomes:  `max_c(theta) = 0.135 - 0.04805595286219849 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.
           
           My approach is to choose a set of diverse rotation angles. For each angle, I'll generate several `(x, y)` coordinates within the calculated `[-max_c, max_c]` range.  The key angles I'm considering are `0`, `pi/6`, `pi/4`, `pi/3`, and `pi/2` radians. For each of these I've precomputed their relevant `max_c` values.
           
           For each rotation, I will generate placements at center, at the extremes along the axes (four points), at the corners (four points), and a mid-quadrant point (total of ten points). This set of points covers the available area effectively and gives the 50 desired placements. I will then use this information to create a list of placements to cover the needs of the request.

           Alright, the task is to find 50 stable placements for a square object (side `s = 0.0961`) on a larger square surface (`S_half = 0.135`). The object needs to be entirely within the surface's boundaries when placed, regardless of rotation.
           
           My approach is to consider the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) as it rotates.  For a square, the effective side length of this AABB changes with the rotation angle, determined by `s_eff = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This means the maximum allowed offset from the center of the surface (`max_c`) varies based on the angle, calculated as `S_half - s_eff/2`.  I'll generate a diverse set of placements by focusing on a handful of key rotation angles and distributing the object's center within the allowed region for each.
           
           I've selected 5 key angles: `0`, `pi/12`, `pi/6`, `pi/4`, and `pi/3`. For each angle, the maximum allowable offset (`max_c`) from the surface center varies. After calculating the `max_c` for each angle, I will then generate 10 placement positions for each angle for a total of 50.
           
           For each `max_c`, the following positions will be used:  the center (0, 0), the four points at the extremes along the axes (+/-max_c, 0) and (0, +/-max_c), the four corner points (+/-max_c, +/-max_c), and (max_c/2, max_c/2).  This should provide a good spread across the surface.

           The user has requested 50 stable placements for a square object (side `s = 0.096`) on a square surface (`-0.135` to `0.135`).  This is a repeat request, so I'll generate a fresh set of placements.  The fundamental challenge is ensuring the rotated object's AABB fits within the surface.
           
           I've got the geometry nailed down: `s` is the object's side length, and `S_half = 0.135` is half the surface's side. For a square object, `s_eff = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))` defines the effective AABB side length at rotation `theta`, which gives `half_s_eff = s_eff / 2`.  Stability hinges on the object's center `(x, y)` being within the constraint: `-max_c <= x, y <= max_c`, where `max_c = S_half - half_s_eff`.
           
           To provide a diverse set of placements, I'll generate positions for different object orientations (angles). I'm selecting five angles, all evenly spaced over the first 90 degrees: 0, pi/12, pi/6, pi/4, and pi/3. For each angle I'll calculate `max_c`, which I need to get the placement positions.
           
           Now, for each angle, I need a good strategy for distributing object centers.  I'll place ten for each of the five angles, starting with the center point. I will then pick four points along the edges using multiples of max_c, four on the corners also multiples of max_c, and then one additional point to get a variety of positions.

(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Square Object**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 8) on a larger square surface (surface 0).  The object has a side length `s` of roughly 0.096 units, and the surface extends from -0.135 to 0.135 on both axes.  My goal is to determine the feasible *x, y* center coordinates for the object, allowing for rotations.
           
           First, I need to account for rotation.  When the square is rotated, its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) expands. I need to calculate the effective side length, `s_eff`, for each rotation, which is dependent on the angle `theta`. The general formula for `s_eff` is: `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.  Then, I calculate half of this `s_eff` so that I can figure out the `max_c` value, which is the maximum amount that I can offset the center coordinate from the origin. 
           
           Since the surface is centered at the origin, the problem simplifies:  I just need to ensure the object's center doesn't extend beyond the surface boundary, accounting for the rotated object's bounding box.  That leads to: `-max_c <= x <= max_c` and `-max_c <= y <= max_c`.  *max_c* is a function of the angle, and depends on how the object is rotated.
           
           I calculated `max_c` for a few key angles, including 0, π/4, and the like.  I arrived at three *max_c* values to be considered:
           `0.08694`
           `0.06705`
           `0.06937`
           These can be assigned to other angles.
           
           To get the 50 distinct placements, I'll focus on 5 angles: 0, π/8, π/4, 3π/8, and π/2.  I then calculated the corresponding *max_c* values for these, ensuring that opposite rotations gave the same values.
           
           For each angle and corresponding *max_c*, I'm going to generate 10 unique placements. I can space these out evenly and avoid clustering in any region.
           
           For each, I'll generate the center `(0.0, 0.0)`, points along axes (`max_c`, `0.0`, `-max_c`, etc.) and corners and distribute the rest in the interior.  This will give me 10 positions for each angle for a total of 50.

(Thoughts: **My Approach to Generating Stable Object Placements**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 8) on a square surface (surface 0). The object has a side length `s = 0.09611190572439698`, and the surface is an AABB defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  Effectively, the surface's half-width/height is `S_half = 0.135`.
           
           To ensure stability, I need to make sure the rotated object's AABB is fully contained within the surface's boundaries. The dimensions of the rotated object's AABB depend on the rotation angle `theta`. I'll calculate `s_eff`, the effective side length: `s_eff = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. Then, `half_s_eff = s_eff / 2`. The object's center `(x, y)` needs to stay within the bounds: `-max_c <= x <= max_c` and `-max_c <= y <= max_c`, where `max_c = S_half - half_s_eff`.
           
           My strategy will be to use a few representative angles and then generate diverse `(x, y)` coordinates for each. I've pre-calculated `max_c` for a few key angles:
           *   `theta = 0` (and multiples of pi): `max_c_0 = 0.08694404713780151`
           *   `theta = pi/4` (and multiples of pi): `max_c_pi_4 = 0.06704903815009076`
           *   `theta = pi/6` (and multiples of pi): `max_c_pi_6 = 0.06937454080981576`

           I'll use these angles: `0`, `pi/6`, `pi/4`, `pi/3`, and `pi/2`. For each angle, I'll calculate the respective `max_c`. Then, for each, I'll use a set of 10 positions: center, extremes, corners, and midpoint, for diversity: `(0.0, 0.0)` for the center, extremes along each axes, corner points and a midpoint will give me 50 placements.

(Thoughts: **My Placement Strategy for Object ID: 8**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object on a square surface.  The object has a side length `s = 0.0961...`, and the surface is centered at the origin with extents of `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`, effectively a half-size of `S_half = 0.135`. The key is that the object needs to be entirely within the surface's boundaries after rotation.
           
           I'll start by calculating the effective side length of the rotated object's AABB (`s_eff = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`), and consequently, its half-length (`half_s_eff = s_eff / 2`).  A stable placement requires that the object's center `(x, y)` satisfies the condition `x_min_surface + half_s_eff <= x <= x_max_surface - half_s_eff` and the same for y. Since my surface is centered at the origin, this simplifies to `-max_c <= x <= max_c` and `-max_c <= y <= max_c`, where `max_c = S_half - half_s_eff`.
           
           To generate diverse placements, I'll strategically vary the rotation angle (`theta`). I calculated the `max_c` values for several key angles: 0, pi/6 (30 degrees), pi/4 (45 degrees), pi/3 (60 degrees) and pi/2 (90 degrees).
           
           *   **theta = 0:**  `max_c_0 = 0.0869...`
           *   **theta = pi/4:** `max_c_pi_4 = 0.0670...`
           *   **theta = pi/6 & pi/3:** `max_c_pi_6 = max_c_pi_3 = 0.0693...`
           *   **theta = pi/2:** `max_c_pi_2 = 0.0869...`
           
           For each angle, I'll generate 10 unique `(x, y)` coordinates.  The coordinates are: the center (0,0), the extreme values along the axes, the corners and a mid-quadrant coordinate. This should ensure diverse, valid placements within each "stable zone" defined by each `theta`. This process will be repeated five times. This guarantees 50 distinct placements because of the distinct rotation angles. I'll need to remember that all the placements will be on surface 0.
           
           Now, let's look at the half values used to calculate the mid quadrant coordiates.
           `half_max_c0 = 0.0434...`
           `half_max_c_pi_6 = 0.0346...`
           `half_max_c_pi_4 = 0.0335...`
           `half_max_c_pi_3 = 0.0346...`
           `half_max_c_pi_2 = 0.0434...`
           
           This systematic approach guarantees that I'll fulfill the criteria while incorporating variation in rotation and position to make the placements both stable and diverse.

           First, I define the key parameters. The object's side length `s` is about 0.096 units. The surface is a 0.27-unit square centered at the origin.
           
           To ensure stability, the object's center must be within a smaller square determined by the rotation angle `theta`. The effective AABB side length `s_eff` depends on `theta`:  `s_eff = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.  Then, the half side length of the surface minus the AABB half-side length gives me my "max_c".  `max_c = 0.135 - half_s_eff`
           
           I'll generate 50 placements by strategically varying both the rotation angle and the object's center coordinates (x, y) within that allowed square. I'm going to focus on a few key rotation angles: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, and pi/2 radians. These angles are chosen because I can easily calculate `max_c` values, or their results are close to those of other angles.
           
           For example:
           *   At 0 degrees, max_c is approximately 0.087.
           *   At pi/4 (45 degrees), max_c is about 0.067.
           *   At pi/8 (22.5 degrees) and 3pi/8 (67.5 degrees), max_c is approximately 0.072
           
           For each rotation, I'll generate 10 placements. These placements will sample the center, the axes, corners, and a mid-quadrant to get a good spread of placements.  For each `max_c`, I'll place points at (0,0), (+/- `max_c`, 0), (0, +/-`max_c`), (+/-`max_c`, +/-`max_c`), and (+/- `max_c`/2, +/- `max_c`/2).
           
           This will give me 5 sets of 10 placements and a total of 50 placements, ensuring that each placement is stable given its chosen rotation.

The surface is also a square, centered at the origin, extending from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  Given my knowledge of AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) calculations for rotated objects, my primary focus is stability, ensuring the object doesn't extend beyond the surface boundaries.
           
           I've formulated the core requirement: For any stable placement, the object's center `(x, y)` must fall within a specific range, determined by `max_c = S_half - half_s_eff`, where `S_half` is the surface's half-dimension (0.135) and `half_s_eff` is the effective half-width/height of the object's rotated AABB. To cover a good variety of stable orientations, I'm testing several distinct rotation angles.
           
           My approach involves calculating `max_c` for various rotation angles: 0, π/8, π/4, 3π/8, and π/2.  I've already calculated the intermediate values like `half_s` (half the object's side length), `cos(theta)`, and `sin(theta)`. Using these, I've derived `half_s_eff` for each angle, ultimately leading to the `max_c` values.
           
           With `max_c` computed for each rotation, I'll generate ten unique positions for each angle: focusing on the center, corners, and midpoints within the constrained region. This should give a robust set of 50 stable placements, achieving the initial goal.

(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for a Square Object on a Square Surface**
           
           I've been tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 8) on a square surface (surface 0). The object has a side length `s`, and the surface is a 0.27x0.27 square centered at the origin. My expertise in this area immediately suggests a systematic approach involving rotation and bounding box analysis.
           
           First, I need to understand how the object's effective size changes with rotation.  I know that for a square rotated by an angle `theta`, the effective AABB side length `s_eff`  is given by `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This is key to determining the allowable placement area. The half-size of that rotated effective bounding box, `half_s_eff`, is then just `s_eff / 2`. The surface has a half-size of `S_half = 0.135`.
           
           For a stable placement, the object's rotated AABB must be fully contained within the surface's boundaries. This translates to the object's center `(x, y)` needing to be within a smaller square defined by `-max_c <= x <= max_c` and `-max_c <= y <= max_c`, where `max_c = S_half - half_s_eff`.
           
           To generate 50 placements, I'll leverage a good strategy: sample several distinct rotation angles and for each angle, generate multiple (x, y) placements within the allowable area.
           
           I calculated `max_c` for a few key angles, including 0, π/4, π/2.  I then decided to use 5 distinct angles, 0, π/8, π/4, 3π/8, and π/2.  This includes angles that give the smallest bounding box, as well as the largest, giving a good sampling.  Using symmetry, I can reduce some calculations.
           
           For each rotation, I'll generate 10 placements that are well-spaced throughout the allowable region, including the center, the axes' extremities, the corners, and an intermediate point in one quadrant.  This will give good coverage of the stable placement space. I have completed the calculations to generate all 50 placements.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation Strategy**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable positions for a square object (ID 8) on a square surface (surface 0).  The object's a square with a side of approximately 0.096 units, and the surface is centered at the origin, ranging from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.  My goal is to figure out the valid (x,y) coordinates within this surface for various rotations.
           
           First, I've determined that the rotated AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) of the object, with an effective side length *s_eff*, needs to be completely within the surface bounds.  This *s_eff* depends on the rotation angle (theta) and is calculated by `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.  I also need the `half_s_eff`, which is `s_eff/2`.  For a stable placement, the center of the object (x,y) must lie within the range of `-max_c` and `max_c`, where `max_c = S_half - half_s_eff`.
           
           I've calculated `half_s = 0.048`.  With this, the equation for `max_c` is simplified to `max_c(theta) = 0.135 - 0.048 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.
           
           My plan is to choose a diverse set of rotation angles and, for each angle, generate multiple (x, y) coordinates within the acceptable range defined by `max_c`. After considering several angles, it seems like a reasonable and diverse strategy is to use the following set: 0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and pi/2.
           
           For each of these rotation angles I will generate 10 placements. Those positions will be: (0, 0), (max_c, 0), (-max_c, 0), (0, max_c), (0, -max_c), (max_c, max_c), (-max_c, -max_c), (max_c, -max_c), (-max_c, max_c), and (max_c/2, max_c/2). The `max_c` will change depending on the angle. This way, I'll have a total of 50 positions.
