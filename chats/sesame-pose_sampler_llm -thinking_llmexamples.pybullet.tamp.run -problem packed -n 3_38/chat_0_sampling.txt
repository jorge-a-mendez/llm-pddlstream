(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to place an object (ID 5, a square with sides of 0.0847) onto a square surface (surface 0, extending from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y) in 50 different, stable configurations.  Since I'm very familiar with these constraints, I've worked out the most efficient way to approach this.
           
           First, I need to understand how the object's rotation affects its placement. The object is a square, so its effective dimensions (the bounding box after rotation) change in a predictable way. I know the maximum effective dimension will occur at 45 degrees, which is 0.0847 * sqrt(2), or approximately 0.1197.  Because this is less than the surface dimension (0.27), I know the object will *always* fit, no matter the orientation.
           
           To determine valid placement coordinates (x, y) for each orientation (theta), I'm calculating the 'half effective dimension' of the rotated object and subtracting that from the surface boundaries.  This ensures the object's center will always be within the surface.  Specifically, for any angle theta, I know the safe placement zone is from `-0.135 + half_effective_dim` to `0.135 - half_effective_dim` in both x and y.
           
           Since I have 50 placements to generate, I'm using a systematic approach.  I'm choosing a set of representative angles to cover the range of possible rotations.  Since the object is square and symmetric, I only need to consider rotations from 0 to pi/2 (90 degrees).  I am selecting angles (in radians): 0, pi/12, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, 5*pi/12, and pi/2.  I calculate the valid (x,y) range for each of these angles.  Since all coordinates will fall between -0.09265 to 0.09265 for orientation 0 degrees and between -0.07513 and 0.07513 for orientation 45 degrees, I decided I can use a consistent x and y coordinate spacing for all angles.
           
           For each selected angle, I'll generate a few x and y coordinates (using the relevant ranges I calculated), aiming for around 7 placements per angle.  I'll ensure the final list contains *exactly* 50 unique placements across the different angles and positions.  The core of the approach is this:  **calculate safe placement ranges for *each* angle, then sample positions within those ranges.** This guarantees the object will always be fully contained within the surface, regardless of its rotation. I am confident in my method, especially considering my experience with this type of task.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object 4: Ensuring Stability and Collision Avoidance**
           
           My primary objective is to strategically place object ID 4, a square, onto surface 0, ensuring that it remains stable and doesn't collide with the already-placed object ID 5. Both objects are nearly identical in size, with object 5 at (0, 0, 0, 0) being a known successful placement.  The critical constraint here is surface 0's bounds, which run from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           My analysis reveals that the most effective approach is to maintain a zero-degree rotation (theta=0) for object 4. This is because any rotation would effectively increase the object's footprint, making collision avoidance more difficult, and severely limiting the valid area on the surface for object placement.
           
           Object 5's bounding box is quite compact at its current position, spanning only a small section of the surface.  Object 4's bounding box has very little room to not have an overlap with the bounding box of Object 5.
           
           The challenge is to find 50 valid, stable placements for object 4 that avoid collision with the already-placed object 5. My analysis shows that these placement strategies depend heavily on where object 5's AABB allows other objects to fit. It's clear that the solution lies in positioning object 4's center close to the surface's edges and outside of a very small zone centered on object 5.  This means that the *x* and *y* placement values must be restricted to certain bands.  For example, valid *x* values are found when placing in [-0.092904,-0.084447) and in (0.084447, 0.092904], and the same rule applies to the *y* values.  This method ensures the AABB boundaries are not overlapping.
           
           I've formulated a detailed plan to achieve the 50 desired placements:  I will employ a grid-based approach. All the points selected will follow the angle of rotation rule I've specified. This strategy leverages two carefully defined bands. Within each region (left, right), I'll strategically position object 4's center in a way that provides 50 stable non-colliding locations within the given surface constraints.

(Thoughts: **My Thought Process for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable positions for a new square object (ID 6) on surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into the existing objects, ID 5 and ID 4. I'm going to leverage my expertise in this type of packing problem to get this done efficiently.
           
           First things first, I've got the surface size: a square with sides 0.27 centered at (0,0). Object 5 is also a square, right in the middle, and object 4 is a square in the bottom left. I've got their sizes and positions.
           
           Now, for placing the new object, which is also a square, I have these critical constraints:
           
           1.  **Stay on the surface:** The new object can't go outside the bounds of surface 0.
           2.  **Avoid collision with Object 5:** It can't overlap with this square at the center.
           3.  **Avoid collision with Object 4:** The new object cannot overlap with the smaller square in the bottom left.
           
           To make things easier and to maximize the space, I'm going to start with a rotation of 0 degrees for object 6 (or pi/2, pi, 3pi/2). So, I'll calculate the bounds considering that object 6 is not rotated.
           
           So, I need to focus on where object 6 won't be colliding: I need to be *outside* of the collision regions of object 4 and object 5.
           
           This means finding the ranges where `x` and `y` center values are possible without causing a collision. Object 4’s AABB is roughly in the -0.1 to -0.05 region, and I know object 6 must be outside that region. And of course, in the center, there is a region to be avoided from Object 5.
           
           Given those regions, I know that my placement strategy will involve placing the center of object 6 along the edge of Object 5's region of space to be avoided, or across the top and right sides of surface 0, being careful to avoid overlapping the AABB of object 4. I can also fill the bottom-right and top-left corners carefully and densely.
           
           I think I will use edge values for `x` and `y` so that the object does not collide. I'll need some values close to 0 that can be filled as well!
           
           With the `(x, y)` values, I can generate enough placements quickly.
