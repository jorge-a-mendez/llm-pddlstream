           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene involves two rovers, v12 and v14, each with a camera (v10) and a storage (v16). There are multiple objectives (v17, v18, v19) and various rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) of different types (v2, v6). The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom that is true if `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)`, `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `type(?stone, v2)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, `type(?soil, v6)`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` are all true.
           
           From the initial state:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are true.
           - `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true.
           - `type(v1, v2)`, `type(v4, v2)`, `type(v3, v2)` (representing stone) are given.
           - `type(v5, v6)`, `type(v8, v6)`, `type(v7, v6)` (representing soil) are given.
           - We need to achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`.
           - We need to achieve `receivedanalysis(v1)` or `receivedanalysis(v4)` or `receivedanalysis(v3)` for a 'stone' type.
           - We need to achieve `receivedanalysis(v5)` or `receivedanalysis(v8)` or `receivedanalysis(v7)` for a 'soil' type.
           
           Since `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are already true and there are no actions that change the `atconf` predicate other than `move`, and the only allowed move actions are self-moves, we do not need to move the rovers for the `atconf` part of the goal. The `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` predicates are also already true.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage` for objectives v17, v18, v19, the rovers need to:
           1. `calibrate` their camera.
           2. `take_image` of the objective.
           3. `send_image` to the lander.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis` for a rock, the rovers need to:
           1. `sample_rock`.
           2. `send_analysis` to the lander.
           
           Let's break down how to achieve the remaining parts of the goal:
           
           For `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`:
           - Rover v12 can see v17, v18, v19 at configuration #o3 with ray #o4.
           - Rover v14 can also see v17, v18, v19 at configuration #o3 with ray #o4.
           - Both rovers have camera v10 which supports mode v11.
           - Both rovers can connect to lander v9 at configuration #o0 with ray #o1.
           
           We can use rover v12 to take and send images for all three objectives. It is initially at v13. We need to find a configuration for `#o3` and `#o0`. Since the same `#o3` and `#o0` are given for multiple image and communication visibility predicates, we can assume that there exists a single configuration that allows for these operations.
           
           For `receivedanalysis(?stone)`:
           - Rocks v1, v4, v3 are type v2 (stone).
           - Rover v12 is above v1, v4, v3 at configuration #o5.
           - Rover v14 is above v1, v4, v3 at configuration #o5.
           - Both rovers have free storage v16.
           We can use rover v12 to sample a stone rock (e.g., v1) and send its analysis.
           
           For `receivedanalysis(?soil)`:
           - Rocks v5, v8, v7 are type v6 (soil).
           - Rover v12 is above v5, v8, v7 at configuration #o5.
           - Rover v14 is above v5, v8, v7 at configuration #o5.
           - Both rovers have free storage v16.
           We can use rover v12 to sample a soil rock (e.g., v5) and send its analysis.
           
           Since we need multiple configurations, and they are all listed with '#' in the initial state, we'll need to define their continuous values. Let's try to use rover v12 for all the tasks as it is already at configuration v13 and we don't have any `move` actions to other non-hash configurations.
           
           Plan:
           1. Calibrate camera v10 of rover v12 at configuration #o3 for objective v17 using ray #o4.
           2. Take image of objective v17 using rover v12, camera v10, mode v11 at configuration #o3 with ray #o4.
           3. Send image of objective v17 in mode v11 from rover v12 at configuration #o0 using ray #o1 to lander v9.
           4. Calibrate camera v10 of rover v12 at configuration #o3 for objective v18 using ray #o4 (assuming calibrate invalidates previous calibration).
           5. Take image of objective v18 using rover v12, camera v10, mode v11 at configuration #o3 with ray #o4.
           6. Send image of objective v18 in mode v11 from rover v12 at configuration #o0 using ray #o1 to lander v9.
           7. Calibrate camera v10 of rover v12 at configuration #o3 for objective v19 using ray #o4.
           8. Take image of objective v19 using rover v12, camera v10, mode v11 at configuration #o3 with ray #o4.
           9. Send image of objective v19 in mode v11 from rover v12 at configuration #o0 using ray #o1 to lander v9.
           10. Sample rock v1 (stone) by rover v12 at configuration #o5 using storage v16.
           11. Send analysis of rock v1 from rover v12 at configuration #o0 using ray #o1 to lander v9.
           12. Sample rock v5 (soil) by rover v12 at configuration #o5 using storage v16. Note that v12 will now have a full storage from rock v1. Thus we need to drop rock v1.
           Wait, `sample_rock` makes `full` true and `free` false. To sample a second rock, `free` must be true. So we need to `drop_rock` after sampling the first rock.
           
           Revised Plan:
           1. Calibrate camera v10 of rover v12 at #o3 for v17 using #o4.
           2. Take image of v17 using v12, v10, v11 at #o3 with #o4.
           3. Send image of v17 in v11 from v12 at #o0 using #o1 to v9.
           4. Calibrate camera v10 of rover v12 at #o3 for v18 using #o4.
           5. Take image of v18 using v12, v10, v11 at #o3 with #o4.
           6. Send image of v18 in v11 from v12 at #o0 using #o1 to v9.
           7. Calibrate camera v10 of rover v12 at #o3 for v19 using #o4.
           8. Take image of v19 using v12, v10, v11 at #o3 with #o4.
           9. Send image of v19 in v11 from v12 at #o0 using #o1 to v9.
           10. Sample rock v1 (type v2, stone) by rover v12 at #o5 using storage v16.
           11. Send analysis of rock v1 from rover v12 at #o0 using #o1 to lander v9.
           12. Drop rock v1 to free storage.
           13. Sample rock v5 (type v6, soil) by rover v12 at #o5 using storage v16.
           14. Send analysis of rock v5 from rover v12 at #o0 using #o1 to lander v9.
           
           Continuous parameter values:
           - For `#o3` (imagevisible config for v12 to v17, v18, v19): A configuration (x,y) close to v12 (1.0, -1.75) with line of sight to the objectives. Objectives are at (-0.468, 1.827) (v17), (2.151, 1.927) (v18), (0.424, 1.919) (v19). Let's pick a configuration that gives a clear view of these. Given v12 is at (1.0, -1.75), and the targets are around y=1.9, a point with y < -1.75 will be occluded. A point with y > -1.75 will also likely be occluded by objects between the rover and the objectives. The current setup for `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` etc. implies that such a configuration #o3 already exists. I will provide a single configuration value for #o3 that can see all objectives.
           - For `#o0` (comvisible config for v12 to v9): A configuration (x,y) close to v12 (1.0, -1.75) with line of sight to lander v9 ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
           - For `#o5` (above config for v12 to rocks v1, v5): A configuration (x,y) close to the rocks that rover v12 can reach and be above.
             - v1: ((-1.044, -0.851), (-0.941, -0.748))
             - v5: ((-2.12, -0.111), (-1.988, 0.021))
           This is tricky, since #o5 is used to be above multiple rocks. The `above` predicate typically requires the robot to be directly above the object. Being above v1 and v5 simultaneously at a single configuration #o5 would mean a very large rover or very close rocks, which is not the case here. This suggests that #o5 might represent a region rather than a single point, or that there are multiple valid #o5 locations for different rocks. However, the problem statement requires a single continuous value for each distinct '#' object. The initial state already implies such a configuration exists for `above(v12, #o5, v1)` and `above(v12, #o5, v5)`. I will define a single point for #o5 that works for the purpose of the plan.
           
           Given that v12 is at (1.0, -1.75) and v1 is at ((-1.044, -0.851), (-0.941, -0.748)) and v5 is at ((-2.12, -0.111), (-1.988, 0.021)), a single configuration #o5 that is above both of them is physically unlikely unless the #o5 implies "can move to be above". However, the problem states to compute a *continuous value* for the configuration. If the continuous value must be a single point, then this cannot be done for multiple rocks far apart. I'll pick a point close to v1 (stone) and v5 (soil). Since the initial state provides `above(v12, #o5, v1)` and `above(v12, #o5, v5)`, it implies such a configuration exists. I'll select a point for #o5 between v1 and v5 that is also somewhat reachable by v12.
           For `#o3`, let's choose (0.5, 0.5) for rover v12 to observe the objectives v17, v18, v19.
           For `#o0`, let's choose (0.0, -1.75) for rover v12 to communicate with lander v9.
           For `#o5`, let's choose (-1.5, -0.5) for rover v12 to be above v1 and v5.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10) , (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11) , (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11) , (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10) , (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11) , (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11) , (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v19 v10) , (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v19 v10 v11) , (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v19 v11) , (sample_rock v12 #o5 v1 v16) , (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v1) , (sample_rock v12 #o5 v5 v16) , (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v5)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The problem states that I can only use actions from the provided list:
           `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))`
           `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`
           `((drop_rock v12 v16))`
           `((drop_rock v14 v16))`
           
           The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which requires:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` (True in initial state)
           - `atconf(v14, v15)` (True in initial state)
           - `free(v12, v16)` (True in initial state)
           - `free(v14, v16)` (True in initial state)
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           - `type(?stone, v2)` (True in initial state for v1, v3, v4)
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`
           - `type(?soil, v6)` (True in initial state for v5, v7, v8)
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           None of the allowed actions (move, drop_rock) can achieve `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`. These predicates are only achieved by `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, respectively, which are not in the allowed action list.
           
           Therefore, it is impossible to achieve the goal with the given set of allowed actions.
