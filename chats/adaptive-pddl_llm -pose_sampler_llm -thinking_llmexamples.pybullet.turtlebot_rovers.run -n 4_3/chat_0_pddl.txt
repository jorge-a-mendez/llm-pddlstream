User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Okay, let's break this down.** The task is to find three valid (x, y) robot base positions to view a target at (0.0, 0.0), with the robot's orientation automatically facing the target. Crucially, these positions must be within a distance of 2 from the target and fall within the workspace boundaries of [-2.5, 2.5] for both x and y.  Obstacles are present, represented as AABBs, and I need to avoid collisions with them and ensure a clear line of sight to the target.
           
           The target point sits directly *inside* a significant obstacle (AABB 5), a vertical wall from x=-0.05 to x=0.05. This is the main crux of the problem! Typically, a target *inside* an obstacle is not viewable, but the problem description hints that a line of sight *is* possible, implying that the target point is either "on" or "through" the obstacle, or the target is conceptual and it is "viewable" as an object would be in real world, which is possible by keeping the target's coordinates overlapping the vertical AABB. My first instinct is to find positions where the robot isn't physically *in* the wall (AABB 5), meaning I need to stay to the left of x = -0.05 or the right of x = 0.05.
           
           I must assume the target is viewable by placing the robot on either side of AABB 5.  This means the robot's x-coordinate will be either less than -0.05 or greater than 0.05.
           
           Considering the problem details, I generate three base positions: (2.0, 0.0), (-2.0, 0.0), and (1.5, 1.0). Each of these points is within the workspace limits, within a distance of 2 from (0,0), and does not collide with the AABBs.
           
           (2.0, 0.0) provides a clear line of sight to the target and is a great position to start. (-2.0, 0.0) provides another clear line of sight, adding more diverse observations. Then (1.5, 1.0) gives more viewing options.
