           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan that achieves `on(v8, v18)`, `on(v12, v18)`, `on(v14, v18)`, and `on(v16, v18)`.  This necessitates placing objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` on surface `v18`.  
           
           My initial assessment reveals a challenging scenario.  All four objects are currently supported by `v11` and occupy specific poses (e.g., `v14` at pose `v15`).  The goal requires these objects to be relocated to pose `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           The standard approach would involve a sequence of pick-and-place actions. However, a critical issue emerges:  the provided initial state lacks any kinematic trajectory facts (`kin`).  Both the `pick` and `place` actions, essential for manipulating objects, have prerequisites that include a `kin` fact, which defines the robot's kinematic trajectory to pick or place.
           
           Furthermore, the only available `move_base` action instance is a no-op, meaning the robot's base configuration is static and cannot be changed. This severely limits the robot's ability to reposition itself.
           
           Without the necessary `kin` facts, the core `pick` and `place` actions are effectively disabled. Therefore, it's impossible to transition the objects from their current supported positions on `v11` to the desired positions on `v18`. Consequently, the specified goal is unattainable given the provided initial state and available actions. The missing `kin` facts represent an insurmountable obstacle, rendering any plan infeasible.
