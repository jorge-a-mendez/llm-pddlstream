           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Atom pose(v15, v16)
           Atom stackable(v15, v10)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)

           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes several objects, `v8`, `v12`, and `v15` which are graspable and stackable. `v10` and `v18` are surfaces where objects can be stacked. `v17` is a type of surface, likely a sink or stove, given the goal. `v11` and `v14` are also surfaces. The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both currently handempty. The robot's base is at `v3` and its arms are at `v5` and `v7` respectively.
           
           The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to the conjunction of `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. From the initial state, we have `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`. This means that either `v8` or `v12` could be the `?green` object. Also, we have `stackable(v8, v18)` and `stackable(v12, v18)`. Thus, we need to place either `v8` or `v12` on `v18`. Let's choose `v8`. Currently, `v8` is at `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`. So we need to pick up `v8` from `v11` and place it on `v18`.
           
           However, the only allowed action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action doesn't change the state of any objects or achieve the goal. No other pick, place, clean or cook actions are available in the list of valid action instances. Therefore, the goal is unreachable with the given allowed actions.
