           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **A Detour Through Infeasibility**
           
           My task is to formulate a plan to satisfy the axiom `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom boils down to achieving a set of conditions that involve receiving images and analyses of certain objects (stones and soil). I've meticulously dissected the conditions, identifying what needs to be true in the initial state and what needs to be achieved through actions.
           
           I noticed that the starting state already satisfies the initial conditions involving rover locations and storage availability.  This simplifies things. The challenging part involves acquiring images and analyses.  I quickly recognized that I need actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` to achieve these goals.
           
           I've carefully examined the problem's constraints, particularly the permitted action instances.  This is where the plan hits a brick wall. The only allowed actions are rudimentary:  `move` and `drop_rock`.  Neither of these actions provide the capabilities I need to perform the requisite sensing and analysis.
           
           The `move` actions are essentially no-ops in this problem.  The rovers are already in the correct starting configuration. The `drop_rock` action can only be executed when a rover is `full`, but the rovers are already free. Therefore, I can't even use this seemingly simple action.
           
           The crucial actions required to achieve the goal are explicitly *not* on the permitted action list, and the actions on the list cannot achieve the goal directly or indirectly. The goal requires actions I am not allowed to use, so the solution is **unachievable**. The current problem description seems to be a well-defined case of a trivial infeasible plan.
