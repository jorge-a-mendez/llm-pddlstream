(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to provide 50 unique and stable placements for a square object (ID 7, size 0.0986 x 0.0986) on a square surface (Surface 0, from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135)).  Stability means the entire object remains within the surface boundaries, regardless of its rotation.
           
           Since the object is a square, its effective bounding box (AABB) changes with rotation. To guarantee stability across all angles, I'll limit the placement area to ensure the object is *always* inside.  The most restrictive placement range occurs when the object is rotated by 45 degrees (pi/4 radians), where the effective AABB is largest. Thus, all placements will be valid within the restricted area.
           
           Here's my approach:
           
           1.  **Define the Valid Placement Area:**  Based on the object's dimensions and the surface size, I've calculated the boundaries within which the *center* of the object must lie to ensure it stays within the surface, even when rotated. The result is: the object's center must be within the smaller square from (-0.065277, -0.065277) to (0.065277, 0.065277).  
           
           2.  **Generate a Grid of Placements:**  I'll create a 7x7 grid of evenly spaced points within the calculated area. This gives me 49 placements, ensuring a good spread across the surface.
           
           3.  **Vary Orientation and Fill the Grid:**  To add diversity, each point in this grid will be assigned a different rotation angle.  I've chosen 8 distinct angles (0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi, 5pi/4, 3pi/2, 7pi/4) and cycle through them as I populate the grid.
           
           4.  **Add the Final Placement:** To reach the target of 50 placements, I'll put the 50th placement at the center of the grid, (0.0, 0.0) with a unique angle to ensure uniqueness. The angle will be pi/8 to make sure its distinct.
           
           The core principle is to use the most restrictive boundaries to guarantee stability for any orientation. Using a grid within this range ensures coverage of the valid area. Varying angles adds diversity to the solutions.

(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for Object 4, Avoiding Collision with Object 7**
           
           Alright, I've got a new task. I need to find 50 stable placements for Object 4 on Surface 0, making sure it doesn't collide with Object 7, which is now a fixed obstacle. Object 4 is a square with sides of approximately 0.0945 units, and Surface 0 is the same as before: a square region from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           My strategy is as follows:
           
           1.  **Define the Safe Region:** First, I'll calculate the valid region where Object 4 can be placed on Surface 0 without any surface boundary constraints, for *any* rotation. This ensures the placement will work, even if the rotation is adjusted later. I know that the maximum extent of Object 4, regardless of rotation, is S\_4 / 2 times root(2) or about 0.0668 units. Surface is large, though. Therefore, the valid center coordinates for Object 4 are from (-0.0681, -0.0681) to (0.0681, 0.0681).
           
           2.  **Account for Object 7:** Object 7 is located at approximately (-0.065, -0.065), and I know it has dimensions of 0.0986 units. To avoid collision, I need to place Object 4 outside a specific "collision zone" determined by Object 7's AABB for any rotation of Object 4. To ensure safe placements, I will consider the rotated Object 4 by calculating its radius for *any* rotation, and make sure that it does not overlap with Object 7's maximal range.
           
           3.  **Prioritize Top-Right Placement:** Since Object 7 is in the bottom-left corner of the surface, my approach is to generate coordinates more likely to avoid Object 7. My strategy for this is generating a grid of coordinates, with more points in the top-right part of the valid area.
           
           4.  **Angle Check:** I plan to check each placement (x, y, and rotation angle). I will use a simple AABB overlap check for each combination of these, making sure Object 4's AABB (for each specified angle) does not overlap with Object 7's AABB. I will use the *most conservative* maximum radius of 0.0668 to guarantee that even for all angles, the collision is safely avoided.
           
           To get the 50 desired placements, my code will iterate through a grid of possible (x, y) coordinates and then check multiple rotations. Then, the collision check function will ensure that none of the generated values cause collisions.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for Object 5 on Surface 0, making sure it doesn't collide with Objects 7 and 4. Here's my thought process:
           
           First, I need to get a handle on the scene. Surface 0 is a square,  with bounds of  `[-0.135, 0.135]` in both x and y. Object 5 is a new square with side length  `0.0862`.  Object 7 is fixed in the bottom-left  (-0.065, -0.065), and Object 4 is fixed in the top-right (0.068, 0.068), and both are also squares.
           
           Next, the geometry: For a square, the effective radius (R_eff) is `side_length / sqrt(2)`. This means  Object 5's max R_eff will be 0.061. Taking that and surface limits, I can work out  the *valid* region on the surface where Object 5 can *theoretically* fit without overlapping the *edge* of the surface, ignoring the obstacles for now.  That valid surface area is the square  `[-0.074, 0.074]` for both x and y.
           
           But, I can't ignore the obstacles! Object 7's AABB is roughly (-0.115, -0.016) in both x and y, and Object 4's AABB is roughly (0.021, 0.115). So, my placement strategy needs to navigate around these fixed shapes. The best area will probably be in the center, and the least constrained will be the two corners.
           
           My plan is to use a systematic *grid* search. I'll define an even grid within the valid region. Since I need *50* placements, I will use a finer grid. To account for different rotations, I'll test several *angles*:  0, pi/4, pi/2, and so on.
           
           The collision check is straightforward: for each candidate placement, I calculate Object 5's AABB (which varies with rotation) and test it against the AABBs of Objects 7 and 4, and only accept the placements that don't collide.
           
           I'll start searching from a corner ( top-left, `x=-0.07`, `y=0.07`) and work inwards. This way I will have more flexibility to use other regions with less collision constraints. I will use a 7x7 grid to get a refined resolution for x and y:
           `grid_coords = [-0.07, -0.046, -0.023, 0.0, 0.023, 0.046, 0.07]`.
           Angles will be evenly spaced.  I will take the first 50 solutions.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing Object 6 on Surface 0 a total of 50 times without any collisions, specifically avoiding Object 7, Object 4, and Object 5.  Object 6 is a square with a side length,  `S_6`, and it needs to be placed within the bounds of Surface 0, which is a rectangular area defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I understand the size of object 6.  My initial assessment focuses on determining the feasible region where the center of Object 6 can reside, considering its effective radius and the size of Surface 0. I calculated the valid center range, taking into account the object's dimensions to prevent it from going outside the boundaries.
           
           Next, I've got to define the areas occupied by the fixed obstacles, Object 7, Object 4, and Object 5.  They are all squares with known positions, angles, and dimensions: Object 7 is in the bottom-left, Object 4 in the top-right, and Object 5 in the top-left.  To make this collision detection easier, I'll calculate the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for each of these three objects. This simplification allows for faster collision checking using readily available methods.
           
           Now for the core of the strategy. I'm going to generate a grid of potential placement locations for Object 6, using a reasonable step size and including the most important angles of rotation.  I will iterate through these locations and rotations, starting with promising areas like the bottom-right and central regions of Surface 0. Then, for each potential placement, I'll calculate Object 6's effective radius, determine its AABB, and then check it against each of the obstacle AABBs. I'll use simple overlap checks in the x and y directions for each object.  If there's no overlap in either direction, it means the placement is collision-free and, therefore, valid.  I need to ensure no collisions occur before assigning the object's valid position.
