User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment:** My primary objective is to determine three valid base positions for a robot, adhering to specific constraints within a defined workspace. The robot's orientation will automatically adjust to face a designated target point. My main concerns involve avoiding collisions with fixed obstacles and ensuring an unobstructed line of sight to the target. The workspace is a 5x5 area centered at (0,0), with the robot's base coordinates (x, y) confined to the range [-2.5, 2.5] for both x and y. Furthermore, the base must be within a maximum distance of 2 units from the target. The main obstacle is the central vertical wall (x=0) and the rest are smaller, axis aligned boxes.
           
           To achieve this, I need to parse the given obstacle information (AABBs) to understand the scene's geometry. The provided obstacles include the workspace boundaries and several other smaller obstacles distributed throughout the space. Notably, a vertical wall at x=0 divides the space into two halves. This central wall presents a critical consideration because any potential base positions must be on the same side of this wall as the target to maintain a clear line of sight.
           
           **Strategy Development:**
           
           1.  **Target Location Analysis:** I'll begin by analyzing the target's position relative to the central wall (x=0). If the target is located on the left side of the wall, I'll prioritize base positions in the same area to avoid obstruction. The inverse applies if the target is on the right side.
           2.  **Candidate Position Generation:** I'll generate several candidate positions by varying the distance from the target (within the 2-unit maximum range) and exploring a range of angles around the target.
           3.  **Validity Checks:** For each candidate position, I'll conduct several checks:
               *   **Boundary Compliance:** Ensure the base position remains within the permitted workspace boundaries (-2.5 to 2.5 in both x and y).
               *   **Distance Constraint:** Verify the candidate position is within 2 units of the target.
               *   **Obstacle Avoidance (Collision Detection):** Determine if the candidate position intersects with any of the fixed obstacles, specifically the AABBs.
               *   **Line-of-Sight Validation:** Confirm an unobstructed line of sight to the target, meaning no fixed obstacles block the direct path between the base and the target.
           
           **Specific Implementation:** Given that the specific `target_point` is (-1.0, 0.0), which puts the target on the left side of the central wall, I will ensure that any generated base position has bx < -0.05.
           
           **Resulting Positions:**
           
           The three generated positions are:
           
           *   (-2.4, 0.0)
           *   (-1.0, 1.5)
           *   (-2.0606, -1.0606)

(Thoughts: **Revised Positioning Strategies Based on Feedback and Scene Geometry**
           
           My initial analysis was hampered by misleading feedback related to a different target point. It appears that the feedback I received was skewed because the target point used for that feedback was, itself, *inside* a fixed obstacle. This fundamentally invalidated the feedback, which made me reassess the implications. This experience forced me to re-evaluate my understanding of the environment.
           
           Therefore, I'm working under the *assumption* that the current target point, (-1.0, 0.0), is valid, as the prompt implies. Based on the previous feedback, and a careful re-examination of potential positions, I've modified my strategy. It seems the left wall, specifically around `x=-2.5`, requires extra caution. Positions *too* close to this boundary are likely to fail. I need to be more conservative and keep my *x* coordinates *greater* than -2.3, even on the left side.
           
           Based on these considerations, I've generated three new positions for the target point `(-1.0, 0.0)`:
           
           1.  `(-2.0, 0.0)`: This is directly left of the target, offering a clear line of sight.
           
           2.  `(-0.5, 1.5)`: This position is to the upper right of the target.
           
           3.  `(-2.0, -1.0)`: This is to the bottom-left of the target.
           
           These positions are all within the maximum range, are in the left side of the workspace, and avoid known obstacles based on my understanding of the scene. I have been extremely careful to avoid collisions with the "left wall" by keeping the *x* coordinate safely away from -2.4. I believe these positions are now much more likely to be valid solutions.
