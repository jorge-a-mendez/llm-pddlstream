           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes two rovers, v12 and v14, each at a specific configuration (v13 and v15 respectively) and equipped with a camera (v10) and a store (v16). There are several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and objectives (v17, v18). The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires that both rovers are at their initial configurations, their stores are free, images of both objectives (v17 and v18) in mode v11 have been received, and rocks of type v2 (stone) and v6 (soil) have been analyzed and received.
           
           Looking at the initial state and available actions, it seems there's a misunderstanding about the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom is designed to represent a *solved* state, not something directly achievable by the listed actions. The definition of `new-axiom@0()` (and its duplicates) in the problem description is a conjunction of many atoms including `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           However, the provided list of "available action instances" is very limited. It only contains `move` and `drop_rock` actions, and crucially, *none* of the `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` actions are listed as available instances.
           
           Since the goal requires receiving images and analyses, and the necessary actions to achieve these (e.g., `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`) are *not* in the provided list of allowed action instances, it is impossible to achieve the goal from the initial state using only the allowed actions.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable.
