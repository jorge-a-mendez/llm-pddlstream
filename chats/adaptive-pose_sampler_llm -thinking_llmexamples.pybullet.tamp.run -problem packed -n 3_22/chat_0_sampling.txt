(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation for Object ID 4**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 4, a square object with sides of 0.081523 units, on surface 0, defined by the bounding box `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. A placement means figuring out the surface index (0 in this case), the rotation angle `theta`, and the (x, y) coordinates of the object's center.
           
           Since it's a square, its dimensions are constant regardless of rotation; therefore, the AABB is always a square. The key is that the *current* AABB is what determines stability, not some theoretical rotated version, given the way the problem is worded. This simplifies things.
           
           The key to stability: the object's center must be far enough from the edges of the surface to ensure the entire object stays within it. Considering I want the object to be stable for all rotations, I need to account for the *largest* AABB I can get. Since the AABB's dimensions stay constant for a square, even when rotated, I only need to worry about the distance from the edges of the square to the surface, which is `obj_half_x` = `obj_half_y` = 0.04076 units.
           
           So the allowable range for x and y are -0.077353 to 0.077353 for both x and y.
           
           To achieve diversity, I'll generate a grid of positions within these bounds using a 5x10 grid. Using the equation `lower_x + obj_half_x <= x <= upper_x - obj_half_x` and similar for y, I calculated the valid ranges. Since the placement criteria state that AABBs will be described in terms of the object, not taking rotation into account, I set theta to 0 (though I'll vary some theta for demonstration).
           
           I've crafted a Python script to do the work. The coordinates are calculated. The script will generate 50 distinct (surf_idx, theta, x, y) placements, where theta will also be variable. Since no other constraints are explicitly given, I will distribute these placements throughout the valid surface area.
           
           Let's do this!

(Thoughts: **Object Placement and Collision Avoidance: A Deep Dive**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed object 4, and now it's time to work on object 5. The feedback confirms the initial placement of object 4 was collision-free. Excellent.
           
           Now, I'm tasked with placing object 5 (a square of side *S_5*) on the same surface without any collisions between it and object 4. This is where things get interesting. I need to generate 50 stable placements, and I have to be precise.
           
           I know I have a set of valid coordinates for object 5's center `(x, y)`. The surface provides us the boundaries. But I also have to consider the prior placement of object 4.
           
           First, I need to understand the dimensions of object 5. It is a square, which simplifies the calculations, but I have to account for rotation. Then, I need to account for rotation, which determines the maximum extent of the object's AABB.
           
           I have already determined the safe range for the center of object 5 on surface 0 using the given range. However, I have to ensure object 5 does not collide with object 4, so I need to filter these valid locations.
           
           The core of the problem boils down to a classic spatial reasoning challenge: avoiding overlap. I'll carefully analyze the AABB of both objects, including their relative positions and rotations. It's essentially about ensuring that object 5's AABB *never* overlaps with object 4's.
           
           I will construct the AABB of Object 4, using its dimensions and placement, and determine its boundaries on the surface. Now, I have to compute, given the dimensions and the safe surface, where to place Object 5.
           
           This means placing object 5 to the top-right of object 4's AABB, using a conservative approach to guarantee no collisions regardless of object 5's rotation, or at least far enough. The simplified rule is: object 5 must be in a specific portion of the grid.
           
           To be truly conservative, and to ensure my placements are correct for any rotation, I must consider where object 5's center `(x, y)` can be located, with its AABB.
           
           So, I need to generate and then filter `(x, y)` points.
           I will generate those points and then select those outside the danger zone, for 24 * 2 = 50 placements.
           
           Now I am ready to calculate those placements.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, here's the scenario: I need to find 50 stable locations to place Object ID 6 on Surface 0. This has to be done carefully, making sure that it doesn't collide with objects already there, specifically objects ID 4 and ID 5.
           
           **1. Understanding the Physical Constraints**
           
           First, I need to know the playing field: Surface 0 is a square, spanning from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). This establishes my valid area. I know my object is a square object: 0.07406210183670747 by 0.07406210183670747.
           
           **2. Accounting for Rotation**
           
           Since it can be rotated, I have to consider the maximum extent of my object when it's rotated. Given the dimensions, and that it's a square, I know that the effective half-dimension of the bounding box will be `half_S * sqrt(2)`. With `half_S_6 = 0.037031050918353735`, it means the maximum rotated extent is about 0.05236764705882353.
           
           **3. Defining the Valid Placement Region**
           
           Knowing the maximum extent, I can calculate the safe zone within Surface 0. To keep it completely inside the surface at any rotation, the center of the square has to be within the square given the surface bounds. Hence, the safe area is between -0.08263235294117647 to 0.08263235294117647 on both the x and y axes.
           
           **4. Considering Pre-Existing Obstacles: Object 4 and Object 5**
           
           Now for collision detection. I have object 4 centered at (-0.07735294117647059, -0.07735294117647059) with side length = 0.08152329606859188 and object 5, centered at (0.03993804723625491, -0.06511764705882353) and side length = 0.09882701171674574. I'll need to define a *forbidden* region for Object 6 to avoid these. I need to figure the safe distance from each pre-existing box that defines a "forbidden zone" where Object 6 cannot be centered.
           
           **5. Building the Forbidden Regions**
           
           To calculate safe distances, I'll need to account for all possible rotation of Object 6, so using the max extent. The safe distances is defined as the maximum bounding-box half-length plus the object's distance plus the half side of the other. For Object 4 it is 0.09312929509311947, and for Object 5, 0.1017811529171964.
           
           I then calculate the forbidden zones as a rectangular region where I can't place the center of the object.
           
           **6. Filtering Valid Placements and Implementing the Placements**
           
           The goal now is to find valid (x, y) coordinates for Object 6's center, while avoiding the forbidden regions. To do this, I set the parameters: `x_valid_min = -0.08263`, `x_valid_max = 0.08263`, `y_valid_min = -0.08263`, and `y_valid_max = 0.08263` for the valid box.
           
           Then I set the parameters for the forbidden zones:
           Region 4 (x and y): `(x <= 0.01577) AND (y <= 0.01577)`
           Region 5 (x and y): `(x >= -0.06184) AND (y <= 0.03666)`
           
           Then I check the center points of the object, against the valid zones. After a few tries, I got 52 valid centers. Finally, I will loop over the valid points, and pick 50 of them
