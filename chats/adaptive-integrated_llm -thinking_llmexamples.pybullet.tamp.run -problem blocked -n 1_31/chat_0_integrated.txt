User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.317, 0.068, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.082, 0.997).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.357, 0.028), (-4.277, 0.108)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Analysis and Goal Breakdown**
           
           My primary objective is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to ensuring an object is "on" surface v18 and has a certain "type." I've determined that the relevant objects are 'v8' and 'v12', and both meet the 'type' requirement. Thus, the core of the problem is placing either 'v8' or 'v12' on v18.
           
           **Examining Initial State and Feasibility**
           
           Crucially, I have to work with the provided initial state and available actions. Both `v8` and `v12` are supported by surfaces, but not v18 directly. Examining `supported` facts, I see `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. This implies, to me, I need to place either object in a configuration that 'supports' them on v18. The available actions are 'pick', 'place', and one `move_base`. Given the constraint on provided actions, and with `move_base` at a null movement, I understand that I need to pick an object and place it on v18.
           
           **Action Preconditions and Dependencies**
           
           To achieve this, I must fulfill the preconditions of 'pick' and 'place'. 'pick' requires a valid kinematic configuration (kin), the object to be at a specific pose (atpose), a handempty robot arm, a valid base configuration (atbconf), and collision-free approach/trajectory (unsafe approach/traj are false). 'place' shares similar requirements, but checks for collision in the final 'pose' configuration (unsafepose). The provided base configuration is 'v3', and possible grasps are available for the objects. I have two arms at my disposal 'v4' and 'v6'.
           
           **Plan Formulation and Refinement**
           
           Considering reachability constraints, and the position and proximity of the objects, I'm choosing to focus on moving v8 to v18 to satisfy my ultimate goal.
           
           **The Plan:**
           
           1.  **Pick:** Using arm v6, pick object v8 at its current pose v9, using grasp #o1, and base configuration v3. The base does not move, since that action is unusable.
           2.  **Place:** Place object v8 on v18 at pose `#o2` using the same grasp, base configuration, and arm. The `#o2` pose is not in conflict with other objects in the environment.
           
           **Continuous Parameter Determination**
           
           For `#o2`, I need to determine an accurate x, y, and z value to support v8 on v18. After careful calculation, considering v8's dimensions and v18's AABB I set the configuration to (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0), which I confirm is collision-free.
           
           **Final Assessment**
           
           If I can use the pick and place actions, this plan satisfies the conditions for the goal `new-axiom@0()` given the available facts in the problem. The plan will move object `v8`, from its initial configuration to a new one that meets the requirements.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v6 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #pick_traj_v8) , (place v6 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #place_traj_v8)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable with Current Action Set**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a seemingly simple task: to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to making an object of a certain `type` be `on` a specific `surface`. The initial state gives me two potential candidates, `v8` and `v12`, both of the required `type`. The issue, however, boils down to the *only* action I'm permitted to use: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This action, as I understand it, doesn't actually *move* anything; it just shifts the robot's configuration.
           
           My initial thought was to use familiar methods -  `pick` and `place` - but, as the constraints clearly state, these aren't available.  To get either `v8` or `v12` `on v18`, I need to adjust their pose.  Initially, `v8` is `on v11` and `v12` is `on v14`, but both are *potentially* able to be *on* `v18`. By axiom,  achieving `on(?green, v18)` requires that it be *supported* on the surface and *at* a certain pose.
           
           The provided `move_base` action, unfortunately, does nothing to manipulate object poses.  It simply changes the robot's configuration internally, so the object poses remain the same. Since my goal explicitly requires changing the pose of an object to make it `on v18`, and my actions can't do that, the goal is simply unachievable with the current action restrictions. I'm therefore not returning a plan because, as an expert, I know a plan can't exist under these conditions.
