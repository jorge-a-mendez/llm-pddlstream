           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).

           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.357, 0.028), (-4.277, 0.108)).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My objective is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` axiom, which requires an object of a certain `type` to be `on` a specific surface. After examining the initial state, I've identified two objects, `v8` and `v12`, that satisfy the `type` requirement. My initial thought is to place one of these objects, specifically `v8`, onto the target surface `v18`.
           
           I analyze the initial positions and find that `v8` is currently supported by and on `v11`, while `v12` is on `v14`.  I observe `v18`'s location and its relationship to where the objects are, thinking that moving an object from where it currently is to on top of v18 is the logical next step.
           
           I recognize that the available robot arm, denoted as `v4`, is the tool for the job. Its initial configuration, `v3`, is recorded and has associated `kin` parameters. I can use the `pick` and `place` actions of this robot arm to achieve the goal by calculating the proper location for object `v8` to be placed. I am then focusing on placing `v8` on `v18`. From the initial state and using the information provided, it seems that the objects require a move_base action before they are picked.
           
           I then evaluate where to place `v8` on `v18`. After considering the AABB values, I calculate a suitable placement pose `#o2` for `v8` on `v18`, such that `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is true.
           
           Considering the action preconditions and effects, I conclude that picking up `v8` from its initial pose at location `v9` and placing it at the calculated location `#o2` on `v18` is the optimal approach. Because the environment has associated kinematics, I will then analyze and calculate the bconf for the move_base, `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`. This will allow the action to be done.
           
           Therefore, the plan is:
           1.  Move the base, the robot's kinematics, `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`
           2.  `pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           3.  `place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           
           For the location of the object to be placed at pose `#o2`, I specify the coordinates `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)` to ensure that it aligns with the target surface and satisfies the required conditions.
           
           In short, the approach is to pick up an object, move the base, place the object in the target position to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, a type of object being placed on top of a surface.
