           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 7) -- 0.09647444330705002, 0.09647444330704996)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27. The object is also square, with side length approximately 0.096.
           
           To find stable placements, I need to ensure the object is fully contained within the surface. The object can be rotated. Given the square nature of both the surface and the object, rotations by multiples of 90 degrees (or pi/2 radians) will result in the same effective bounding box for containment purposes. For other angles, the effective bounding box of the object will be larger.
           
           Let's denote the object's half-dimensions as `obj_half_x = 0.09647444330705002 / 2` and `obj_half_y = 0.09647444330704996 / 2`.
           The surface has `surf_min_x = -0.135`, `surf_min_y = -0.135`, `surf_max_x = 0.135`, `surf_max_y = 0.135`.
           
           For an object with dimensions `size_x` and `size_y` rotated by `theta`, the effective half-dimensions for its AABB are `effective_half_x = abs(size_x/2 * cos(theta)) + abs(size_y/2 * sin(theta))` and `effective_half_y = abs(size_x/2 * sin(theta)) + abs(size_y/2 * cos(theta))`.
           
           Since the object is square (size_x approx size_y), for `theta = 0` or `theta = pi/2`, `effective_half_x` and `effective_half_y` will be `size_x/2` or `size_y/2`. In this case, `0.09647444330705002 / 2 = 0.048237221653525`.
           
           The surface extends from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           The object's half-size is approximately 0.048.
           The maximum x-coordinate for the object's center is `0.135 - 0.048 = 0.087`.
           The minimum x-coordinate for the object's center is `-0.135 + 0.048 = -0.087`.
           So, the x and y ranges for the center are `[-0.087, 0.087]`.
           
           I will generate placements across the surface, varying the x, y coordinates and the angle. Since the object is square and the surface is square, rotations of 0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2 will have the smallest effective footprint. Other angles will have a larger footprint. I will prioritize 0 and pi/2. I will also generate placements with other angles to ensure diversity.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27.
           I now have information about a previously placed object (ID 7).
           Object 7 (ID: 7) is at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) on surface 0. Its dimensions are 0.09647444330705002 x 0.09647444330704996. With theta=0, its bounding box is approximately `(-0.0482, -0.0482)` to `(0.0482, 0.0482)`.
           
           The new object (ID 5) is also square, with side length approximately 0.09425.
           Its half-dimensions are `obj5_half_x = 0.0942518166644074 / 2 = 0.0471259083322037` and `obj5_half_y = 0.09425181666440746 / 2 = 0.04712590833220373`.
           
           The surface has `surf_min_x = -0.135`, `surf_min_y = -0.135`, `surf_max_x = 0.135`, `surf_max_y = 0.135`.
           
           For object 5 with `theta = 0` or `theta = pi/2`, its effective half-size is approximately 0.047.
           The maximum x-coordinate for the object's center is `0.135 - 0.047 = 0.088`.
           The minimum x-coordinate for the object's center is `-0.135 + 0.047 = -0.088`.
           So, the x and y ranges for the center are `[-0.088, 0.088]`.
           
           I need to find placements for object 5 such that it is on surface 0, and does not collide with object 7.
           Object 7 is centered at (0,0) and its AABB is roughly `[-0.0482, 0.0482]` in x and y.
           
           This means object 5 cannot be placed with its center in this range and overlap significantly.
           If I place object 5 with `theta = 0`, its AABB is `[x_center - 0.0471, x_center + 0.0471]` and `[y_center - 0.0471, y_center + 0.0471]`.
           To avoid collision with object 7, the AABBs must not overlap.
           For example, if `x_center - 0.0471 >= 0.0482` or `x_center + 0.0471 <= -0.0482`.
           `x_center >= 0.0482 + 0.0471 = 0.0953`.
           `x_center <= -0.0482 - 0.0471 = -0.0953`.
           These values are outside the allowed range for the center `[-0.088, 0.088]`. This implies that if both objects are axis-aligned, they cannot be placed side by side on the same surface without overlap if both are within the surface bounds.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the collision condition more carefully.
           Object 7's AABB: `obj7_min_x = -0.048237221653525`, `obj7_max_x = 0.048237221653525`, `obj7_min_y = -0.04823722165352498`, `obj7_max_y = 0.04823722165352498`.
           
           Object 5's AABB (if theta=0): `obj5_min_x = x - 0.0471259083322037`, `obj5_max_x = x + 0.0471259083322037`, etc.
           
           Collision occurs if:
           `obj7_max_x > obj5_min_x` AND `obj7_min_x < obj5_max_x` AND
           `obj7_max_y > obj5_min_y` AND `obj7_min_y < obj5_max_y`
           
           Let's pick an x and y for object 5. For example, `x = 0.08` and `y = 0.08` (with theta=0).
           Obj 5 AABB: `[0.08 - 0.0471, 0.08 + 0.0471]` = `[0.0329, 0.1271]` in x.
           Obj 5 AABB: `[0.08 - 0.0471, 0.08 + 0.0471]` = `[0.0329, 0.1271]` in y.
           
           Collision check with obj 7 AABB `[-0.0482, 0.0482]`:
           X-axis: `obj7_max_x (0.0482)` is `>` `obj5_min_x (0.0329)`. True.
           `obj7_min_x (-0.0482)` is `<` `obj5_max_x (0.1271)`. True.
           Y-axis: `obj7_max_y (0.0482)` is `>` `obj5_min_y (0.0329)`. True.
           `obj7_min_y (-0.0482)` is `<` `obj5_max_y (0.1271)`. True.
           All conditions are true, so these objects *would* collide with this placement.
           
           Since both objects are almost identical in size and the surface is relatively small, it seems very difficult to place object 5 without colliding with object 7 if they are both axis-aligned. The combined width of two objects is `0.0964 + 0.0942 = 0.1906`. The surface width is `0.27`.
           The sum of half-widths is `0.0482 + 0.0471 = 0.0953`.
           The total span required for two objects side by side (touching) is `0.0953 * 2 = 0.1906`.
           If object 7 is at (0,0), its AABB is `[-0.0482, 0.0482]`.
           For object 5 to be placed without collision with object 7 (axis aligned), its minimum x must be `> 0.0482` or its maximum x must be `< -0.0482`.
           If `x - 0.0471 > 0.0482`, then `x > 0.0953`. This `x` is outside `[-0.088, 0.088]`.
           If `x + 0.0471 < -0.0482`, then `x < -0.0953`. This `x` is also outside `[-0.088, 0.088]`.
           This means it is impossible to place object 5 axis-aligned with object 7 on the same surface without collision.
           
           However, the objects can be placed with different orientations. A rotated object's effective AABB can be used. For a general rotation, the diagonal of the object's bounding box will define the maximum extent for its AABB. However, both are nearly square.
           Let's consider that the prompt states "You may reuse previous placements if they are stable, but if a placement fails multiple times, it is likely that there is a collision that you are not aware of, and you should try a different placement." This implies that the 'fixed obstacles' that caused failures are what I should learn from. The success of (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) for object 7 indicates it's stable and fixed. My current task is to avoid collision with *that* fixed object.
           
           My prior reasoning about the collision for axis-aligned objects is correct. It's impossible to place object 5 axis-aligned with object 7 without collision on this surface.
           
           Therefore, to find a stable placement for object 5 *without* colliding with object 7, I need to either:
           1. Place object 5 at an angle such that its effective AABB allows it to squeeze in. However, for square objects, any angle other than multiples of pi/2 will actually *increase* the AABB size, making it harder to fit.
           2. The problem implies that the definition of stable placement means it's fully contained within the surface bounds, and it does not collide with *any* fixed obstacle (which now includes object 7).
           
           Given the sizes, it seems impossible to place the second object without collision.
           Is there an interpretation where objects can overlap without "colliding"? The prompt states "avoid collision between objects i and j".
           This implies that I *must* avoid collision.
           
           If it's truly impossible to place object 5 without collision with object 7 on surface 0, then I should report that. However, the instructions say "You never give up."
           
           Let me re-read the exact phrasing: "avoid collision between objects i and j".
           This means the AABB of object 5 must not intersect the AABB of object 7.
           Given the calculations, they *must* overlap if they are both placed on surface 0, axis-aligned.
           Let's confirm the effective AABB of a rotated square object.
           For a square of side `s`, rotated by `theta`, the effective half-width and half-height for its AABB are `s/2 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.
           If `theta = pi/4` (0.785 rad), then `cos(theta) = sin(theta) = sqrt(2)/2`.
           Effective half-width = `s/2 * (sqrt(2)/2 + sqrt(2)/2) = s/2 * sqrt(2)`.
           For object 5, `s = 0.09425`. `s/2 = 0.047125`.
           Effective half-width at 45 degrees = `0.047125 * sqrt(2) = 0.0666`.
           This is larger than the 0.0471 half-width when axis-aligned. So rotation makes it harder, not easier, to fit.
           
           It's possible my interpretation of "fully contained within the bounds of the surface" implies the center of the object must be within certain bounds *after* considering its size and orientation, which I did.
           
           Perhaps the definition of collision is not AABB vs AABB. But the problem describes objects in terms of AABB. I must assume AABB vs AABB.
           
           If it is truly impossible, what should I do? The prompt implies "You never give up." I must provide 50 placements.
           Could it be that the problem allows for placing objects *partially* off the surface, as long as it's 'stable'? "fully contained within the bounds of the surface" contradicts this.
           
           What if the initial placement for object 7 was considered stable *before* any other objects were added? But now object 7 is a "fixed obstacle".
           So I must avoid collision with it.
           
           Let's assume there is a subtle error in my calculation, or I should try to place it as far as possible, even if it slightly collides. However, I must return *valid* placements.
           
           What if I place it extremely close to the edge of the surface, but still within the bounds?
           Max x for object 5 center (theta=0) = `0.135 - 0.0471259 = 0.0878741`.
           If I place object 5 at `(0, 0.0878, 0.0)` for example (theta=0).
           Its AABB in y would be `[0.0878 - 0.0471, 0.0878 + 0.0471]` = `[0.0407, 0.1349]`.
           Object 7 AABB in y: `[-0.0482, 0.0482]`.
           These still collide on the y-axis (`0.0482 > 0.0407` and `-0.0482 < 0.1349`).
           
           This is a tricky situation because my geometric reasoning suggests that, given the strict AABB collision and surface containment rules, it's not possible to place object 5 without collision.
           
           Let me review the problem statement carefully: "You are not given the full geometry of the scene, but you will be given feedback of whether a placement is stable and whether it collides with any of the fixed obstacles in the scene." "If you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene."
           
           This feedback loop implies that I don't have perfect information, and I *must* propose placements even if I'm unsure. Since I'm explicitly told "You never give up", I should just provide placements that are as "best effort" as possible, even if my geometric reasoning says they will collide. The system will tell me if they collide.
           
           Given my current understanding, I cannot place object 5 without collision with object 7.
           However, I must provide 50 placements. This means I should try to find placements that minimize collision, or perhaps my AABB collision check is too strict.
           
           What if the definition of "collision" is not AABB vs AABB but actual geometry? But I'm only given AABB extents. I have to assume AABB collision.
           
           Since I *must* output placements, I will proceed with placements that are as "far away" from object 7 as possible, while still being within the surface. It's possible that the definition of collision or object geometry is different from my assumption.
           
           I will attempt to place the object near the corners and edges of the surface, as far as possible from the center where object 7 is.
           I will use the full range of possible center coordinates for object 5 based on surface bounds, which are `[-0.0878741, 0.0878741]` for `theta = 0`.
           I will generate placements that are clustered around the corners and edges.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27.
           I now have information about two previously placed objects:
           Object 7 (ID: 7) is at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) on surface 0. Its dimensions are 0.09647444330705002 x 0.09647444330704996. With theta=0, its AABB is approximately `(-0.0482, -0.0482)` to `(0.0482, 0.0482)`.
           
           Object 5 (ID: 5) is at (0, 0.0, 0.087, 0.087) on surface 0. Its dimensions are 0.0942518166644074 x 0.09425181666440746. With theta=0, its half-dimensions are approx 0.0471. Its center is (0.087, 0.087). Its AABB is approximately `(0.087 - 0.0471, 0.087 - 0.0471)` to `(0.087 + 0.0471, 0.087 + 0.0471)`, which is `(0.0399, 0.0399)` to `(0.1341, 0.1341)`.
           
           This is a crucial piece of feedback! My previous geometric reasoning suggested that placing object 5 at (0.087, 0.087) would cause a collision with object 7.
           Let's re-evaluate:
           Object 7 AABB: `[-0.0482, 0.0482]` in x and y.
           Object 5 AABB: `[0.0399, 0.1341]` in x and y.
           
           Collision check for X-axis:
           `obj7_max_x (0.0482)` > `obj5_min_x (0.0399)` - True
           `obj7_min_x (-0.0482)` < `obj5_max_x (0.1341)` - True
           Collision check for Y-axis:
           `obj7_max_y (0.0482)` > `obj5_min_y (0.0399)` - True
           `obj7_min_y (-0.0482)` < `obj5_max_y (0.1341)` - True
           
           All conditions for AABB collision are true. Yet, the placement was successful.
           This means my interpretation of "collision" or "object geometry" in the context of AABB is incorrect. It's possible that the "AABB" describes the *extents* of the object but not its precise geometry, and the actual geometric shapes allow for tighter packing. Or, the collision detection is not a simple AABB overlap check. Since I am only given AABB extents, I cannot derive a more complex collision model.
           
           Given this new information, I must adjust my strategy. My previous strict AABB collision avoidance was not aligned with the system's actual collision detection. The system implies that objects can be placed closer than a strict AABB collision check would suggest.
           
           The new object (ID 4) is also square, with side length approximately 0.09735.
           Its half-dimensions are `obj4_half_x = 0.09735350858495079 / 2 = 0.048676754292475395`.
           
           The surface has `surf_min_x = -0.135`, `surf_min_y = -0.135`, `surf_max_x = 0.135`, `surf_max_y = 0.135`.
           For object 4 with `theta = 0` or `theta = pi/2`, its effective half-size is approximately 0.0487.
           The maximum x-coordinate for the object's center is `0.135 - 0.0487 = 0.0863`.
           The minimum x-coordinate for the object's center is `-0.135 + 0.0487 = -0.0863`.
           So, the x and y ranges for the center are `[-0.0863, 0.0863]`.
           
           Since the previous placement of (0, 0.0, 0.087, 0.087) for object 5 was successful (which collided with object 7 by AABB definition), I should consider positions that are 'near' other objects, as they might not collide either.
           
           My new strategy:
           1. Continue to respect surface bounds based on the object's AABB for `theta=0` or `theta=pi/2`.
           2. Generate placements that are clustered around the available empty space, and even in areas that would seem to "AABB collide" based on my previous understanding, to explore the actual collision mechanics.
           3. Since object 7 is at (0,0) and object 5 is at (0.087, 0.087), I will try placing object 4 in the other "corners" or "edges" relative to object 7. For example, (-0.086, 0.086), (0.086, -0.086), (-0.086, -0.086).
           4. I will also try placing object 4 next to object 5, or next to object 7 in a similar 'overlapping AABB but non-colliding' manner.
           
           Let's use a slightly smaller value for the center coordinates than the maximum allowed, to be safe. For example, 0.085 instead of 0.0863.
           
           Object 7: Center (0,0), Half-dims (0.0482, 0.0482)
           Object 5: Center (0.087, 0.087), Half-dims (0.0471, 0.0471)
           
           I need to find places for Object 4 (Half-dims 0.0487, 0.0487).

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27.
           I now have information about three previously placed objects:
           Object 7 (ID: 7) is at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) on surface 0. Its dimensions are 0.09647444330705002 x 0.09647444330704996. With theta=0, its half-dimensions are approx 0.0482. Its AABB is approximately `(-0.0482, -0.0482)` to `(0.0482, 0.0482)`.
           
           Object 5 (ID: 5) is at (0, 0.0, 0.087, 0.087) on surface 0. Its dimensions are 0.0942518166644074 x 0.09425181666440746. With theta=0, its half-dimensions are approx 0.0471. Its center is (0.087, 0.087). Its AABB is approximately `(0.0399, 0.0399)` to `(0.1341, 0.1341)`.
           
           Object 4 (ID: 4) is at (0, 0.0, -0.085, 0.085) on surface 0. Its dimensions are 0.09735350858495079 x 0.09735350858495084. With theta=0, its half-dimensions are approx 0.0487. Its center is (-0.085, 0.085). Its AABB is approximately `(-0.085 - 0.0487, 0.085 - 0.0487)` to `(-0.085 + 0.0487, 0.085 + 0.0487)`, which is `(-0.1337, 0.0363)` to `(-0.0363, 0.1337)`.
           
           The crucial insight from previous successes is that the system's collision detection is more permissive than a strict AABB overlap check. Objects can be placed such that their AABBs technically overlap, yet they are considered not to collide. This implies that the actual geometry, while described by AABB extents, is not strictly rectangular, or the collision system is more lenient (e.g., only checking the center point, or a specific shape within the AABB). Since all objects so far are nearly square and placed with theta=0, this is a strong indicator that the underlying shape is something like a circle or a rounded square within the AABB.
           
           The new object (ID 6) is also square, with side length approximately 0.09898.
           Its half-dimensions are `obj6_half_x = 0.09897937612320862 / 2 = 0.04948968806160431`.
           
           The surface has `surf_min_x = -0.135`, `surf_min_y = -0.135`, `surf_max_x = 0.135`, `surf_max_y = 0.135`.
           For object 6 with `theta = 0` or `theta = pi/2`, its effective half-size is approximately 0.0495.
           The maximum x-coordinate for the object's center is `0.135 - 0.0495 = 0.0855`.
           The minimum x-coordinate for the object's center is `-0.135 + 0.0495 = -0.0855`.
           So, the x and y ranges for the center are `[-0.0855, 0.0855]`.
           
           I need to find placements for object 6 such that it is on surface 0, and does not collide with objects 7, 5, and 4.
           Given the observed behavior, I can try placing object 6 in the remaining "corners" or along the edges, assuming similar "non-collision" despite AABB overlap.
           
           Known object positions:
           Obj 7: (0,0)
           Obj 5: (0.087, 0.087) (top-right-ish)
           Obj 4: (-0.085, 0.085) (top-left-ish)
           
           Available "slots" around the center, given the previous successes:
           - Bottom-right corner: `(0.085, -0.085)` (for Obj 6)
           - Bottom-left corner: `(-0.085, -0.085)` (for Obj 6)
           - Along the right edge, not at a corner.
           - Along the bottom edge, not at a corner.
           
           I'll generate placements, prioritizing the "empty" corners and edges, and then exploring central positions, following the pattern of the successful placements.
