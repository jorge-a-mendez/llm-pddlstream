           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Reachability of `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which I've now expanded and understand requires satisfying eight conditions: two `atconf` atoms, two `free` atoms, two `receivedimage` atoms, and two `receivedanalysis` atoms.
           
           Initial assessment: the first four conditions are already true in the initial state. The challenge lies in achieving the remaining four: getting two images and two successful analyses.
           
           Now, the crucial part. I've reviewed the available actions, and here's the kicker: I'm *only* allowed to use the specific action instances provided. This is a severe constraint.  I immediately recognize that those instances -- two "do-nothing" `move` actions and two `drop_rock` actions that are actually irrelevant because of the initial state -- are completely inadequate for what I need to do.
           
           I require actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`.  Without those, I'm stuck. It's mathematically impossible to achieve the goal with these severely limited actions.  The `drop_rock` actions are irrelevant because they require `full` as a precondition and the rovers are initially `free`. The `move` actions don't do anything because the starting and ending locations are identical.
           
           Therefore, my conclusion is clear: the goal, as defined, is simply unreachable with the constraints I've been given. It's a matter of logic.  The allowed actions cannot produce the required predicates, and thus, I have a clear and justifiable reason why it is unreachable. My focus now is on clearly articulating this to show the problem's unsolveability given the restricted action set.
