           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching the Unreachable: A Deadlock in the Planning Process**
           
           My primary objective is to develop a plan that leads to `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunction of various conditions, including receiving images and analyses. Upon detailed analysis, a significant hurdle arises: the available action instances severely limit our ability to achieve the required subgoals.
           
           The initial state reveals that achieving `receivedimage` hinges on using `take_image`, and ultimately `send_image`.  However, to `take_image`, the rover must be at a specific configuration specified by `imagevisible` predicates. Given that the provided action instances restrict the rover's movements to self-moves, we cannot reposition the rovers to satisfy the configuration requirements of `take_image`. The continuous parameters used in the `imagevisible` are distinct from the fixed configuration objects (`v13`, `v15`).
           
           Similarly, achieving `receivedanalysis` requires sampling rocks, which in turn demands the rovers to be at configurations where they are *above* relevant objects. Again, given that the rovers are limited in their moves to self moves, the configuration requirements cannot be satisfied.
           
           Because the rovers are unable to reposition themselves, neither `receivedimage` nor `receivedanalysis` can be achieved. And since they are conjunctively needed for the goal, the overall goal is unattainable.
