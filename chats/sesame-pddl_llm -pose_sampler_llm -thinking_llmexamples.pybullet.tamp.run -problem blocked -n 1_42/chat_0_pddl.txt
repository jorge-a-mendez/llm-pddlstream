(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy**
           
           I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for a 0.07 x 0.07 object on a surface defined by the AABB ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  A stable placement means the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) is fully contained within the surface's AABB after accounting for rotation.  I'll generate these placements by creating a list of values for the index of the surface `surf_idx` (which in this case is always 0), the angle of rotation `theta`, and the center coordinates `(x, y)` of the object's rotated AABB.
           
           To handle rotation, I need to understand how the object's AABB changes. The problem specifies dimensions for the *unrotated* AABB which, for a square object, simplifies things. I compute a "rotated" AABB to determine the valid placement area on the surface. Since the object is square, its width and height (0.07) are equal to size_x, size_y.  The maximum expanded rotated width/height occurs at 45 degrees, which is `0.07 * sqrt(2)/2`. For the rotations of (0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, pi/2), it will range from  min 0.035 to max 0.049.
           
           My strategy involves selecting 5 different angles, `theta`, for the rotation: 0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and pi/2.  I then calculate the corresponding world-aligned, half-dimensions, `hw_rotated` and `hh_rotated` of the rotated bounding box for each angle. Using those rotated extents, I then determine the valid (x,y) coordinates on the surface. To get 50 different placements, for each `theta` I'll create a 2x5 grid of placement positions. This will yield 2 positions for x and 5 for y for each theta, which will ensure 50 distinct placements, because 5 thetas * 2 positions for x * 5 positions for y = 50.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Placing Object 10**
           
           Okay, I've got a new request, and it's time to figure out where to place object ID 10 on surface 0 without running into any trouble with the previously placed object ID 5.  I need to ensure stability on surface 0 and that object 10 doesn't collide with the existing object 5 instances.
           
           I've got the object extents: it's basically a little square, roughly 0.0833 units on each side. The important detail here is the rotation; I need to figure out the maximum extent (AABB) of the object when rotated.  For a square, the rotated size depends on the angle (theta).  I've got the formulas for calculating the rotated AABB dimensions for any rotation.
           
           Surface 0 has its dimensions, width is 0.6 and the height also is 0.6.  The previous placements for object 5 are a set of 10 AABBs.
           
           The first step is to compute the AABBs for the object 5 instances, these instances are all placed at a rotation of 0, so their dimensions remain constant. After computing the AABBs for object 5, it is clear that they are grouped into two vertical columns of five stacked squares each, and there is space between the two columns.
           
           I'm aiming for 50 valid placements for object 10, including the same rotation angles as before (0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and pi/2 radians).  This will give me the desired diversity.
           
           For each rotation, I need to find the allowed center positions (x and y) for object 10's AABB on surface 0, making sure I stay within the surface's boundaries. But I *also* need to check against object 5's AABBs.
           
           The critical challenge is preventing collisions.  If I choose an x-position for object 10 that overlaps with *either* column from object 5, I'm almost certainly going to collide.  My best bet is to only place object 10 in the gap between the two columns, and the vertical placement needs to avoid collision, too, but I've calculated that the spacing is too tight for the given object sizes, which is an important insight!
           
           I'll iterate through each of the possible rotations:
           1.  Calculate the rotated AABB size.
           2.  Determine the valid surface center position bounds.
           3.  Calculate the gap (safe x-range).  This is the key.
           4.  Generate y-positions with good spacing that won't collide with object 5, *only* if the gap is wide enough to place the object without x-collision.
           5.  Check for collisions in the x and y dimensions.
           6. Generate 10 valid placements per rotation by using x-positions in the gap.
           
           Okay, let's start calculating the specific x- and y-positions for my 50 placements! Based on the calculations above, I *can* choose placements in the gap as long as object 10's rotation places it entirely in the x-gap and the y-positions are appropriately spaced. I've computed the coordinates, and I'm ready to place them.
