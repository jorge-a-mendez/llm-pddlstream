(Thoughts: **My Strategic Placement Plan**
           
           I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0. This surface is a square, 0.27 units on each side, centered at the origin. The object is nearly square, with dimensions of about 0.09767 units.  A key challenge is that the object's dimensions are almost equal.  This means that the object's effective bounding box changes little with rotation.
           
           To ensure stability, the object's AABB must stay entirely within the surface's AABB.  I've considered that the most restrictive case is at 45 degrees, where the object's rotated bounding box is largest. I calculated the maximum effective dimension, taking rotation into account to be approximately 0.138. The object's maximum rotated size is smaller than the surface, allowing for placements in most rotations.
           
           My plan involves two representative angles: 0 (no rotation) and pi/4 (45 degrees, which yields the largest effective object dimension). I've calculated the range of valid x, y coordinates for both cases, accounting for the object's dimensions at each angle. I'll create a 5x5 grid of placements within the allowed x, y ranges for each angle. This will result in exactly 25 placements at 0 degrees and 25 at pi/4 degrees to fulfill the requirement for 50 placements. This grid approach ensures even coverage of positions for each rotation.
           
           Here are the placements I came up with:

(Thoughts: **My Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. I've got a new request to find 50 stable placements for object ID 4 on surface 0.  I've noted that a previous placement for object ID 5 was successful (at a specific position), but that's not relevant here since we're dealing with a new object.  The key is that I need to ensure object ID 4 doesn't collide with the fixed obstacles defined by surface 0.  Since there are no other placed objects yet, I don't need to worry about inter-object collisions at this stage, which will be important if any later objects are placed.
           
           The object is a square: `size_x = size_y = 0.08668369461229053`. The surface 0 is defined by (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  Given the object's square shape, the approach will involve:
           
           1.  Calculating effective dimensions for different rotations.
           2.  Determining the allowable `(x, y)` center ranges for each rotation.
           3.  Generating a grid of placement candidates.
           
           For the object, the maximum effective dimension occurs at a 45-degree rotation (`theta = pi/4`).  In this case, it's about 0.123, which is well within the surface dimensions. So, I will calculate for `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/4`.
           For  `theta = 0`, the range for both x and y will be [-0.091658, 0.091658].
           For  `theta = pi/4`, the range for both x and y will be [-0.073682, 0.073682].
           Then, I will use a 5x5 grid for each rotation and generate 25 candidate placements at both `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/4`, which gives the 50 total placements.
           The coordinate linspaces are created as:
           - For `theta = 0`, `x_coords = [-0.09165815, -0.04582907, 0.0, 0.04582907, 0.09165815]` and `y_coords = [-0.09165815, -0.04582907, 0.0, 0.04582907, 0.09165815]`.
           - For `theta = pi/4`, `x_coords = [-0.07368282, -0.03684141, 0.0, 0.03684141, 0.07368282]` and `y_coords = [-0.07368282, -0.03684141, 0.0, 0.03684141, 0.07368282]`.
           I'll then output these placements in the appropriate format.

(Thoughts: **Scene Analysis and Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The task is to place 50 new objects (ID 6) on surface 0 without collisions. I've got the dimensions of the surface, object 6, and the AABBs of the already placed objects (IDs 4 and 5).  I've converted the existing object locations to AABBs, which I've approximated for simplicity. It appears all the existing objects are crammed into the bottom left corner of the surface.
           
           To guarantee no overlap, I'll place the new objects to the right, beyond the maximum x-coordinate of the existing objects. This way, I won't have to deal with complex geometry and union calculations to ensure a no-collision placement.
           
           Given the object is roughly square with dimensions 0.08885 x 0.08885, I will place objects at two angles, zero and 45 degrees relative to the surface.
           
           I'm calculating safe placement zones and generating a grid of potential locations, ensuring the new object's minimum x-coordinate is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of the previously placed objects. This should ensure collision-free placements.
