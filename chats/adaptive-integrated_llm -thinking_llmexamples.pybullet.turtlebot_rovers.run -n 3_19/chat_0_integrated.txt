           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: `new-axiom@0`. This is defined as a conjunction of several atomic facts, some of which are initially true (like `atconf` and `free`), while others aren't. My primary objective is to make all those facts true. However, there's a significant constraint: I'm only allowed to use `move` and `drop_rock` actions in my plan.
           
           Initially, I identified the necessary actions to achieve each of the atomic facts. For instance, to get `receivedimage`, I'd need `take_image` and then `send_image`.  Similarly, for `receivedanalysis`, I need `sample_rock` then `send_analysis`. But here's the kicker: none of these required actions (`take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`) are available in the list of valid actions.
           
           This immediately screams "unreachable goal" to me. I've analyzed the initial state and the goal conjunction, confirming that the needed predicates like `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` are false initially, and that I lack the means to make them true.  The provided actions are simply incapable of affecting these states. There is no way to *create* the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates using just `move` and `drop_rock`.
           
           Therefore, based on this thorough analysis and the constraints of the problem, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable. I won't generate any plan because it is not possible to achieve the required state given the available actions and the initial state.
