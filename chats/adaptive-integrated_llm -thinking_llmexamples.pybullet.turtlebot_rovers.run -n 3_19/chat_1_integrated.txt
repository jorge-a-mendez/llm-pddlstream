           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've devised to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`:**
           
           First, let's break down the objective. It boils down to getting images of three objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`) using a specific mode (`v11`) *and* receiving analyses of a stone (`type v2`) and soil (`type v6`). I'm going to leverage rover `v12` to handle everything, as it starts in a good position and has the necessary resources.
           
           My initial state tells me that rover `v12` is *already* in a favorable configuration.  It's at `v13`, and its store, `v16`, is free. My plan focuses on the subgoals for images and for analyses:
           
           **For the Images:**
           
           1.  I'll need to move rover `v12` from its starting point (`v13`) to a suitable position (`#o3`) for imaging these objectives.
           2.  I'll calibrate the camera (`v10`) on rover `v12` for *each* objective.  A key challenge is defining the point `#o3` is at a location that is also reachable with minimal movement.
           3.  I will take images of all three objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`).
           4.  Next, I'll move to a different location, `#o0` because the initial configuration for `comvisible` requires it.
           5.  I will transmit these images to the lander (`v9`).
           
           **For the Analyses:**
           
           1.  I will move to location `#o5`, as this is a location where initial facts tell us `above` relations exist.
           2.  With `v12`, I will then sample rocks, specifically, sample `v1` (stone) and `v5` (soil). Because I can only sample one rock at a time, I will need to use `drop_rock`
           3.  I'll then transmit those analyses to the lander (`v9`).
           4.  Finally, after everything is done, I'll move back to `v13`, though this is redundant as the *initial* state also includes the position of `v14` in the goal definition.
           
           I've considered all the preconditions for each action to build this sequence. The key points are:
           
           *   I'll carefully choose the continuous coordinates for `#o3`, `#o0` and `#o5`.
           *   I'll need to remember to calibrate the camera *before* each image.
           
           No assumptions have been made, so I must consider this a valid plan.

           I've considered all the preconditions for each action to build this sequence. The key points are:
           
           *   I'll carefully choose the continuous coordinates for `#o3`, `#o0` and `#o5`.
           *   I'll need to remember to calibrate the camera *before* each image.
           
           No assumptions have been made, so I must consider this a valid plan.

(Thoughts: **Revised Plan with Collision Avoidance**
           
           Okay, so the initial plan failed due to collisions at configurations `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5` with static obstacles. I need to recalculate these positions to be safe.  First, let's analyze those collisions.
           
           For `#o3 = (0.075, 1.955)`:  This bumped into `v20`, a thin wall centered at x=0.  My point was within range, I'm guessing I wasn't accounting for the robot's width in the collision detection.  Also, it slightly clipped `v21`. A better solution would be to choose `#o3` further out to the left to avoid these problems, maybe `(-0.5, 1.9)`  sounds reasonable, this will also keep it in range of the images that need to be captured.
           
           Next, for `#o0 = (0.0, -2.0)`, colliding with `v20` again.  Simple fix, move the x value a bit further to the side, let's try `(0.5, -2.0)`.
           
           Finally, for `#o5 = (0.0, 0.0)`, again, a collision with `v20`, so pushing this over to `(-0.5, 0.0)` should work.
           
           With these adjusted coordinates, I need to verify that my plan still functions correctly.  I'm basically running through the actions again and the preconditions.  The `move` actions depend on collision-free paths, which now I believe I have.  The `calibrate`, `take_image`, and `send_image` actions depend on visibility and communication, and those relationships are given in the initial state. The `sample_rock`, `drop_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions rely on being above and having the storage to sample which I have, so everything checks out. The plan sequence stays the same, it's just the coordinates that are updated. It looks good now!

(Thoughts: **The Plan**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan for this mission. The previous tries had some bumps, but I've re-evaluated everything. My goal is to use the existing rovers to complete all objectives: imaging, communication, and sampling, within the confines of the world map. I'll stick with a single rover for efficiency. The key is to find good spots for imaging that avoid the obstacles and give clear lines of sight, while being reachable, and then ensure the path for comms and sampling can also be reached.
           
           First up, the imaging. The plan is to get the rover (`v12`) to take pictures of three objects: `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`. The start is `v13 = (1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           *   **Imaging: The Rover is `v12`**: I will need three configurations for imaging, which I'll call `#o3_17`, `#o3_18`, and `#o3_19`. These should be different for the solver to work.
               *   `#o3_17`: I'm placing it at `(-1.0, 1.0)` to get a clear shot of `v17`. It should be approximately 1.1 units away. This spot avoids the obstacles.
               *   `#o3_18`: The optimal position is `(1.0, 1.0)`. It should be 1.08 units away. This also avoids the problem obstacles.
               *   `#o3_19`: The position is again `(-1.0, 1.0)`. It should be 1.19 units away.
           *   **Comms**: Then, I need to communicate with the lander. I'm going to put the rover at `#o0_comm = (-0.5, -1.0)`. This should be approximately 1.7 units away from the lander (`v9`). It also is clear of all the obstacles, and reachable.
           *   **Sampling**: Now for the rocks. I have two rock samples to collect: `v1` (stone) and `v5` (soil). I'll have two sampling locations for this: `#o5_v1` and `#o5_v5`.
               *   `#o5_v1 = (1.17, -0.4)`: for `v1`. This is directly above the rock.
               *   `#o5_v5 = (-1.24, 0.0)`: for `v5`. This is directly above the rock.
           
           To sum it up:
           1.  **Move to `imagevisible` config (Rover to `#o3_17`, then take image)**
           2.  **Move to `imagevisible` config (Rover to `#o3_18`, then take image)**
           3.  **Move to `imagevisible` config (Rover to `#o3_19`, then take image)**
           4.  **Move to `#o0_comm`, and `send_image` for each of the three. Comms**
           5.  **Move to `#o5_v1` for `sample_rock(v1)`, and `drop_rock`. Sampling**
           6.  **Move to `#o5_v5` for `sample_rock(v5)`, and `drop_rock`. Sampling**
           7.  **Send the analyses, and head back to initial rover position.**
           
           Before that, I'll need to double check the preconditions and make sure that the locations are clear. They'll work!

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Plan with Correct Notation**
           
           Okay, so the main hurdle I faced was the mismatch between my strategy of using different coordinates for various tasks and the required notation in the plan's actions. The key is that the actions need to utilize generic parameters like `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`, as provided in the action list, even though the actual continuous values associated with these parameters will vary depending on the specific rover-target pairing, as I previously planned. The system will handle this using the configurations.
           
           So, the new plan structure needs to reflect this constraint. For the image acquisition, I need to move `v12` to `#o3` three times (for `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`), and the coordinate values for each #o3 need to be different in the configuration section. I can achieve the correct movement, by understanding that the *destination* configuration for the previous `move` action becomes the *source* for the next `move` action. The same approach applies to sampling and communication. The plan should work if the coordinates for the different locations are clearly provided in the `Configurations` section, and if the continuous values for the `#oX` parameters are unique for each (rover, target) pair.
           
           Now, I'll need to define precise coordinates for `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5` for imaging, communication, and rock sampling/analysis, respectively, making sure the rover can reach those spots without collisions.
           
           I've determined the following coordinates:
           - `#o3` for `v17`: (-1.0, 1.5)
           - `#o3` for `v18`: (1.0, 1.5)
           - `#o3` for `v19`: (-0.15, 1.5)
           - `#o0` for `v9`: (-0.5, -1.0)
           - `#o5` for `v1`: (1.17, -0.4)
           - `#o5` for `v5`: (-1.24, 0.0)
           
           Using these, the plan structure will be:
           
           1.  `move v12 v13 -> #o3` (for v17)
           2.  `calibrate`, `take_image` (for v17)
           3.  `move v12 #o3 -> #o3` (for v18)
           4.  `calibrate`, `take_image` (for v18)
           5.  `move v12 #o3 -> #o3` (for v19)
           6.  `calibrate`, `take_image` (for v19)
           7.  `move v12 #o3 -> #o0` (for comms)
           8.  `send_image` (for v17, v18, v19)
           9.  `move v12 #o0 -> #o5` (for v1)
           10. `sample_rock` (v1)
           11. `drop_rock`
           12. `move v12 #o5 -> #o5` (for v5)
           13. `sample_rock` (v5)
           14. `move v12 #o5 -> #o0` (for comms)
           15. `send_analysis` (v1, v5)

(Thoughts: **Plan Refinement for Rover Task Execution**
           
           Okay, so I've been wrestling with this plan to get the rover, `v12`, to complete all the objectives: image collection, rock sampling, and data transmission. The primary sticking point has been reachability, especially around the obstacle `v20`, the wall at x=0. Previous attempts to use a two-rover system hit dead ends because of communication restrictions, so I'm committed to finding a solution with just `v12`. I'm going to carefully define each of the configurations, considering the obstacle placement and the known initial mobility of the rover, to create reachable paths.
           
           Here's my approach:
           
           1.  **Imaging Configurations (`#o3`)**: I need a unique `#o3` configuration for each image target (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`).
               *   `v17` (`(-1.8, 2.1)`): I'm trying `#o3_v12_v17 = (-1.0, 1.0)`. This position gets me within range for the image, and it avoids collision with obstacles: it skirts `v20`, stays below `v22`, and clears `v19`. The key is to be sure I'm reachable from the starting point without a conflict!
               *   `v18` (`(0.45, 1.94)`): I'm trying `#o3_v12_v18 = (0.8, 1.0)`. This spot gets me an image of the target and avoids collision with `v20`, it also keeps clear of the new obstacles in the region like `v23` and `v24`.
               *   `v19` (`(-0.3, 1.97)`): I'm trying `#o3_v12_v19 = (-0.9, 1.5)`. Avoiding collisions with obstacles `v20`, `v22`, and the target `v19` itself.
           2.  **Communication Configuration (`#o0`)**: `(-0.5, -1.0)`
           3.  **Sampling Configurations (`#o5`)**: Sample soil near the rocks.
           
           *   `v1` : `(1.17, -0.52)`
           *   `v5` : `(-1.24, -0.07)`
           
           I'm hoping these configurations will be feasible for pathfinding. The key is now ensuring the pathfinding algorithm can actually find a solution using these coordinates without triggering a "not reachable" error! Now that it's all defined, I hope that makes it clearer to the execution system. The plan is now to be a solo rover, who also handles the send_analysis actions and send_image actions.
           
           *   `#o0_v12_v9`: `(-0.5, -1.0)`.
           
           Here's the planned action sequence, built around these configurations:
           
           1.  Start at `v13=(1.0, -1.75)`
           2.  Move to `#o3_v12_v17`: take image
           3.  Move to `#o3_v12_v18`: take image
           4.  Move to `#o3_v12_v19`: take image
           5.  Move to `#o0_v12_v9`: Send all the images to be transmitted.
           6.  Move to `#o5_v12_v1`: sample_rock
           7.  Move to `#o5_v12_v5`: sample_rock
           8.  Move to `#o0_v12_v9`: Send analysis for all the rocks.
           9.  Return to `v13`.
           
           The core assumption is that these `#oX` configurations are now *reachable* based on the problem's constraints. If this doesn't work, I'll have to reevaluate those `motion` predicates.

(Thoughts: **Refining the Plan for a Challenging Environment**
           
           Based on feedback, it's become clear that the initial plan faces significant hurdles. Specifically, the robot's mobility and the environment's layout, particularly the wall at x=0, are crucial constraints. My initial assumption was a more open field of movement for the robots. I now understand that these factors necessitate a completely re-evaluated plan.
           
           The `rover v12` robot, starting at (1.0, -1.75), is likely confined to the positive x side, while the `rover v14`, starting at (-1.0, -1.75), is confined to the negative x side due to the wall (obstacle `v20`) at x=0. The implication is significant: the rovers cannot simply move freely and must now operate within their restricted zones. This makes it impossible for `v12` and `v14` to perform tasks on opposite sides of the wall, and necessitates that each one handles tasks within their restricted space.
           
           This dramatically alters the task allocation. I have to split the goal based on the physical constraints: imaging and sampling tasks must be confined to each robot's side of the wall. Rover `v14` will image `v17` and `v19` on the negative x side, sample `v5` also on the negative x side, and send results. Rover `v12` will image `v18` on the positive x side, sample `v1` on the positive x side, and send the results. The key communication, the vital transfer of information, still has to be accomplished. I'm assuming that line-of-sight communication is still possible across the wall, allowing the robots to relay data to the base. 
           
           To ensure the plan's validity, I will re-examine the collision-free configurations (obstacles `v20`, `v21`, `v22`, `v23`, `v24`) for each rover's movement. Crucially, I must calculate the locations for the continuous configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` for both rovers to guarantee that they are reachable, and stay on their sides of the wall. This will involve choosing new coordinate locations. I will ensure all parameters meet the criteria for motion.
           
           The plan itself, now split and re-evaluated, is a sequence of rover-specific actions designed to satisfy the original goal, with the rover's initial positions, targets, and communication requirements updated. The updated configurations must be verified to be valid and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Navigating Obstacles and Refining the Rover Strategy**
           
           Okay, so the last attempt failed. I'm seeing a pattern where configurations for `v12` were consistently unreachable, and one for `v14` was in collision. The "unreachable" errors suggest my choice of coordinates is the problem. It seems I'm getting too close to potential, unlisted obstacles or that the chosen coordinates are geometrically difficult.  The collision with `v14` at `(-1.5, -1.0)` is a clear indication of `v25`, a new obstacle that I'll need to work around.
           
           I'm going to start from scratch. I'll need to rethink the placement of the rovers to keep them in their respective `x > 0` and `x < 0` zones, away from obstacles. The goal here is to select points that are more central within each accessible area.
           
           **Here's the new plan:**
           
           *   **For `v12` (starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`, operates in `x > 0`):**
               *   **Imaging `v18`:** `(0.8, 1.2)` will be the location, away from the division (`v20`)
               *   **Sampling `v1`:**  I'll place it at `(1.17, -0.5)`.
               *   **Communicating with `v9`:** I'll set it at `(0.7, -1.8)`.
           
           *   **For `v14` (starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`, operates in `x < 0`):**
               *   **Imaging `v17`:** I'll use `(-1.2, 1.8)` to avoid the division.
               *   **Imaging `v19`:** I'll be at `(-0.5, 1.5)`.
               *   **Sampling `v5`:** This will be at `(-1.24, -0.1)`. I'm hoping this resolves the prior "unreachable" problem.
               *   **Communicating with `v9`:** I'll set this at `(-1.8, -1.2)`, to work around the new obstacle.
           
           The overall strategy is to make a sequence of operations that can accomplish the given tasks. First, all `v12` actions (image, sample, communicate) and then all `v14` actions. Both rovers must finish with a final free(rover, store).

User:      Configuration #o3 = (1.5 1.0) for rover v12 at target v18 is not valid because the target is not visible from the rover's camera due to occlusion.
           Configuration #o3 = (-1.5 1.0) for rover v14 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (-1.0 1.5) for rover v14 at target v19 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o5 = (-1.24 -0.2) for rover v14 at target v5 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-1.8 -1.8) for rover v14 at target v9 is in collision with the following fixed obstacles:
           
           ```
           v9: AABB(lower=[-2.4047, -2.3455502384913305, 0.0], upper=[-1.3952999999999998, -1.6544497615086693, 0.40766007847975994])
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating Reachability and Occlusion**
           
           The previous attempt failed due to reachability issues, specifically for configurations involving `v14` and occlusions for `v12`'s imaging. The "not reachable" errors are the most significant problem, pointing to fundamental limitations in the path planning or the robot's perception of obstacles.  I'm sticking with the two-rover strategy, acknowledging the impassable nature of `v20`.
           
           My focus now is a meticulous re-evaluation of configurations, prioritizing reachability and clear lines of sight.  The precise bounding boxes of obstacles and targets are critical for this. I'm choosing configurations that are not only collision-free but also have ample space around them.
           
           **For Rover `v12` (starting at `(1.0, -1.75)`, confined to `x > 0`):**
           
           *   **Imaging `v18`:** The previous `(1.5, 1.0)` was occluded. I need to move further out or higher up. I'm going with `(1.8, 1.5)`. This should provide a clear view over the nearby obstacles.
           *   **Sampling `v1`:** The previous `(1.2, -0.6)` was unreachable. I'll align with its y-coordinate but offset the x-coordinate to give more space from `v20`, trying `(1.5, -0.5)`.
           *   **Communicating with `v9`:**  The previous `(1.0, -2.0)` was unreachable. I'll try `(1.5, -1.5)`.
           
           **For Rover `v14` (starting at `(-1.0, -1.75)`, confined to `x < 0`):**
           
           *   **Imaging `v17`:** Previous `(-1.5, 1.0)` was unreachable. I'm trying `(-2.0, 1.5)`.
           *   **Imaging `v19`:** Previous `(-1.0, 1.5)` was unreachable. I'm trying `(-0.5, 1.0)`.
           *   **Sampling `v5`:** Previous `(-1.24, -0.2)` was unreachable.  Let's try `(-1.5, -0.1)`.
           *   **Communicating with `v9`:**  The previous `(-1.8, -1.8)` collided. Need to find a spot *near* it. I'm going with `(-1.2, -1.9)`.
           
           The plan structure remains unchanged. Both rovers must finish with a free store and return to their original configurations.
           
           **Revised Configurations:**
           
           *   v12: Imaging (1.8, 1.5), Sampling (1.5, -0.5), Communicating (1.5, -1.5)
           *   v14: Imaging (-2.0, 1.5) and (-0.5, 1.0), Sampling (-1.5, -0.1), Communicating (-1.2, -1.9)
