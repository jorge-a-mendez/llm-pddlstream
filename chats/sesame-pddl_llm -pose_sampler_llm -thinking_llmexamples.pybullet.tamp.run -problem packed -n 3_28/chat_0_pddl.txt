(Thoughts: **50 Stable Placements for Object 4 on Surface 0**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to find 50 stable placements for Object ID 4 on Surface 0. Object 4 is almost square with dimensions `w = 0.08290978564384405` and `h = 0.08290978564384399`, and Surface 0 is a square region defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. Stability means the object's rotated bounding box (AABB) must fit entirely within the surface's AABB.
           
           To ensure this, I'll calculate the rotated object's dimensions based on its rotation angle `theta`. The rotated width (`rotated_w`) and height (`rotated_h`) are influenced by `theta` as follows: `rotated_w = w * abs(cos(theta)) + h * abs(sin(theta))` and `rotated_h = w * abs(sin(theta)) + h * abs(cos(theta))`. Since w and h are very close, I can expect the range of rotation to be about 0.0414 - 0.0586 range. The area surface area is 0.27 x 0.27, so it's a generous space for rotation.
           
           Next, I need to determine the valid placement region. The object's center `(x, y)` has to satisfy the following constraints: `surf_min_x + rotated_w / 2 <= x <= surf_max_x - rotated_w / 2` and `surf_min_y + rotated_h / 2 <= y <= surf_max_y - rotated_h / 2`. In this case the surface area is bounded by `(-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135)`.
           
           To create 50 placements, I'll use a systematic approach:
           
           1.  **Angle Sampling:** I'll sample `theta` across the full range (0 to 2*pi). For the current implementation, I am using 10 equally spaced angles (0, pi/5, 2pi/5, ...).
           2.  **Position Generation:** For each angle, I'll identify 5 distinct valid `(x, y)` positions: the center of the valid placement region and the four corners of the valid region's bounding box. For instance, if the rectangle has range 0.108 to -0.108 for X and same for Y at 45 degree angle. It will rotate back. This produces a variety of configurations.
           
           This ensures a good spread of placements across different orientations.  Since this is the first object, I don't need to check for collision with other objects, which simplifies the process. The code will generate a list of 50 placements, each represented as `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`. I will verify by making sure that the final generated bounding boxes do not go beyond the bounds of surface area.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Object Placement Summary**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The task is clear: find 50 stable and collision-free placements for Object 5 on Surface 0, given Object 4's position. Object 4 is now at the origin, and its dimensions are known. The surface area and object's shapes are well-defined.
           
           The core strategy is collision avoidance. Since Object 4 is centered, the logical move is to place Object 5 around the edges or corners of the surface to ensure separation. The size difference between the objects will be critical to this strategy. Specifically, given that object 5 has a side length of 0.072, I calculate its maximum and minimum rotated dimensions, which depend on `theta`. I need to find `theta` for which `hw` can fit between object4 and surface border in all cases.
           
           I know I can't put `hw` greater than 0.046775. So, I will choose various `theta` values in the possible range for all the possible cases that I consider.
           I will pick a total of 12 suitable angles, and for each of them, I know I must find 4 positions, using the strategy described above.
           For example, for `theta=0`, I also consider additional points close to the corners.
           Then, I will get the required number of total 50 positions.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with precisely positioning Object 6 – a near-perfect square with dimensions of roughly 0.087 units – onto Surface 0, ensuring it doesn't collide with the existing Object 4 and Object 5, while simultaneously maintaining stability.  Surface 0 is a rectangular area bounded by (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135).  Object 4 is centered at the origin, and Object 5 is positioned at (-0.088, -0.088). Object 6 must stay completely within Surface 0.
           
           The key is preventing collisions. I've broken it down: first, the surface bounds limit the center point of Object 6, and second, I must account for the collision zones of Objects 4 and 5. With the possibility of rotation, the AABB of Object 6 expands according to theta, becoming an AABB for all rotations. For a given center location, the expansion is the half-width times `|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|`.
           
           If `theta = 0`, then the range is simple. Given Object 4 is centered at 0,0, and Object 5 is located to the bottom left, the only possible center position is near (0.09, 0.09). For different thetas, the range changes.
           
           However, I've noticed a constraint. To avoid collisions, the orientation is pretty restricted. This implies that the only valid orientations are close to 0, pi/2, pi, or 3pi/2. With 10 angular options and 5 placement positions, I can generate 50 valid placements.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single surface `0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. Several objects have already been successfully placed and now act as fixed obstacles. I need to find 50 stable placements for the new object (ID: 6) with dimensions `0.0869372980104412` x `0.08693729801044126`. This object is essentially a square, let `L6 = 0.0869372980104412`.
           
           **Fixed Obstacles and Their AABBs (approximately, for clarity):**
           
           *   **Object 4 (ID: 4):** Centered at `(0, 0)`, `theta=0`. AABB: `(-0.04145, -0.04145)` to `(0.04145, 0.04145)`.
           *   **Object 5 (ID: 5):** Multiple placements, all at `theta=0`.
               *   `O5_1`: `(-0.08823, -0.08823)`. AABB: `(-0.12429, -0.12429)` to `(-0.05216, -0.05216)`.
               *   `O5_2`: `(-0.08823, 0.08823)`. AABB: `(-0.12429, 0.05216)` to `(-0.05216, 0.12429)`.
               *   `O5_3`: `(0.08823, -0.08823)`. AABB: `(0.05216, -0.12429)` to `(0.12429, -0.05216)`.
               *   `O5_4`: `(0.08823, 0.08823)`. AABB: `(0.05216, 0.05216)` to `(0.12429, 0.12429)`.
               *   `O5_5`: `(-0.09894, -0.09894)`. AABB: `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(-0.06281, -0.06281)`.
               *   `O5_6`: `(0.09894, 0.09894)`. AABB: `(0.06281, 0.06281)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           *   **Object 6 (ID: 6) (previous successful placements):** All previous placements were clustered in the top-right quadrant.
               *   Union of these O6 AABBs with O5_4 and O5_6 creates a large obstacle `O_TR`: `(0.04145, 0.04145)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           
           **Strategy for New Placements of Object 6:**
           
           The object (ID: 6) is a square. Its half-dimensions when rotated by `theta` are `hw_rot_x = hw_rot_y = (L6/2) * (|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|)`.
           Let `hw = L6/2 = 0.0434686490052206`.
           The function `C_theta = (|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|)` varies between 1 (at `theta = k * pi/2`) and `sqrt(2) approx 1.414` (at `theta = (k + 0.5) * pi/2`).
           To fit in the very constrained space, `C_theta` must be as close to 1 as possible. This means `theta` must be `0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2` or very close to these values. If `C_theta` increases, the object's effective AABB becomes larger, making it impossible to fit in the narrow corridors.
           
           After detailed collision checks, the viable regions for Object 6 are thin strips centered on the x and y axes, outside of Object 4, and outside the combined corner obstacles.
           
           Specifically, for `theta = 0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2` (where `hw_rot = hw`):
           The new object's AABB `[cx - hw, cx + hw] x [cy - hw, cy + hw]` must be checked against all existing obstacles.
           
           Valid regions for the center `(cx, cy)` avoiding collision with Object 4:
           *   `cx = 0`: `cy` in `[0.04145 + hw, 0.135 - hw]` (Top strip) and `[-0.135 + hw, -0.04145 - hw]` (Bottom strip).
               *   Top strip for `cy`: `[0.08492354, 0.09153135]`
               *   Bottom strip for `cy`: `[-0.09153135, -0.08492354]`
           *   `cy = 0`: `cx` in `[0.04145 + hw, 0.135 - hw]` (Right strip) and `[-0.135 + hw, -0.04145 - hw]` (Left strip).
               *   Right strip for `cx`: `[0.08492354, 0.09153135]`
               *   Left strip for `cx`: `[-0.09153135, -0.08492354]`
           
           These ranges are all very narrow (length `0.00662`). Within these narrow strips, I will pick 3 distinct positions (min, mid, max values for the center coordinate along the strip).
           This gives `4 strips * 3 positions/strip = 12` unique positions.
           
           I will use these 12 positions for `theta = 0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2`. This yields `12 * 4 = 48` placements.
           For the remaining 2 placements to reach 50, I will choose two positions from this set and apply a very small rotation (`+/-0.001` radians) to `theta=0`. This slight rotation keeps the `hw_rot` very close to `hw`, maintaining stability.
           
           Let `pos_val_min = 0.08492354`
           Let `pos_val_mid = 0.088227445`
           Let `pos_val_max = 0.09153135`
           (And their negative counterparts).
