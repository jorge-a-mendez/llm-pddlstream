           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Here's my thought process:**
           
           I need to generate 50 stable placements for an object on a surface. The object is nearly square, with dimensions of about 0.09763 x 0.09763. The surface is a square AABB from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  A stable placement means the rotated object's bounding box is fully contained within the surface.
           
           I'll define a placement as (surf_idx, theta, x, y), where `surf_idx` is the surface index, `theta` is the rotation angle, and (x, y) is the object's center.  The core challenge is figuring out the valid (x, y) ranges for different rotation angles.
           
           The object's effective dimensions change with rotation. I need to calculate `effective_w` and `effective_h` based on `theta`, using the formula `effective_w = w * abs(cos(theta)) + h * abs(sin(theta))` and `effective_h = w * abs(sin(theta)) + h * abs(cos(theta))`, where `w` and `h` are the object's dimensions.
           
           For containment, I need: `surf_lower_x <= x - effective_w / 2`, `x + effective_w / 2 <= surf_upper_x`, `surf_lower_y <= y - effective_h / 2`, and `y + effective_h / 2 <= surf_upper_y`. This gives me the allowed x and y ranges.  Since the object is nearly square, I can use some simplifications, like approximating w and h as the same value.
           
           My strategy is to:
           
           1.  Generate a few representative angles. For a square-like object, angles from 0 to pi/2 should cover all the unique bounding box shapes. I'll pick angles like 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, and pi/2.
           2.  For each angle, calculate the effective bounding box dimensions.
           3.  Calculate the valid x and y ranges using the surface dimensions and effective dimensions.
           4.  Generate (x, y) coordinates within those ranges, aiming for about 10 placements per angle. I'll use a grid-based approach.
           
           I'll create a helper function `calc_effective_dims(theta)` to calculate the effective dimensions.  Then, I'll use another helper function `get_valid_xy_ranges(theta)` to calculate the allowed x and y ranges.
           
           I'll start with a 3x3 grid (9 placements) for each angle, with a total of 7 angles. The total placements is more than 50 (to be trimmed down). Since there is a new collision on request for the same objects, I will discard any prior knowledge and start fresh. I can then use `numpy.linspace` to create evenly spaced x and y values. Finally, I generate the 50 placements in the specified format and will adhere to the provided surface and object dimensions.

(Thoughts: **My primary objective is to generate 50 stable, non-colliding placements for a new object (ID 4) on surface 0, given that object ID 5 is already placed.**  I've received confirmation of object 5's placement, and now I need to strategize for the new object. The core constraint is that object 4 *must not collide* with the pre-existing object 5.
           
           First, I need to understand where object 5 is.  I've defined its position and dimensions: the object is close to a square and situated in the bottom-left corner of the surface.  Since the rotation angle of object 5 is zero, its effective dimensions are its actual dimensions. Using this information, I can calculate object 5's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box), which occupies a rectangular area on the surface.
           
           Now, focusing on object 4, I will use its dimensions and then define its effective dimensions for a given `theta`. My challenge is to find placements for object 4 that *avoid* any overlap with object 5's AABB.  I've derived the collision avoidance condition: the new object's AABB (which is determined by `theta`, or rotation angle) must not overlap with object 5's AABB.
           
           The area is bounded, `[-0.135, 0.135]` for x and y, and object 5 is placed in the bottom-left corner. Thus, I expect most of the available space for object 4 to be in the top-right and along the top and right edges.
           
           I will iterate through rotation angles (0, pi/12, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, 5pi/12, pi/2). For each angle, I will first calculate the effective dimensions of object 4. Then, I need to determine the valid center coordinates for object 4. These coordinates must stay within the surface limits *and* avoid the collision region around object 5.
           
           The collision region with object 5 can be defined by two non-overlapping valid regions:
           1. Object 4 is completely to the right of Object 5 (any Y coordinate)
           2. Object 4 is completely above object 5 (any X coordinate)
           
           To generate valid placements, I will calculate the limits for these two regions for each rotation angle. I will use a simple sampling strategy (e.g. 3 x 3 grid), and calculate the corresponding points for these valid regions. Then, I will gather all these points into a list of possible stable, valid placements.
           
           In summary, I am systematically determining collision-free placements by careful consideration of the object dimensions and the impact of rotation, combined with the constraints imposed by the occupied space from the first object.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for Surface 0 (ID 6)**
           
           My task is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 6) on surface 0, while avoiding collisions with two existing objects (ID 5 and ID 4).  Surface 0 is a square region centered at the origin, with side length 0.27.
           
           I've carefully analyzed the positions and dimensions of the existing objects, determining their bounding box coordinates.  The two existing objects effectively occupy a rectangular region at the bottom of the surface. To avoid collisions, the new object must be placed *above* this occupied region.
           
           The new object is a perfect square.  I'll start with 7 rotation angles: 0, pi/12, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, 5*pi/12, and pi/2. For each angle, I must determine:
           
           1.  **Effective Dimensions:** Calculate the object's effective width and height considering its rotation.
           2.  **Surface Containment:**  Calculate the valid center ranges (x and y) within the surface boundaries.
           3.  **Collision Avoidance:** Calculate the y-minimum to place above the obstacles: this is the obstacle's maximum y coordinate (approximately -0.037) plus half the object's effective height.  This gives the valid range.
           4.  **Placement Generation:**  I will generate a 3x3 grid of placement points for each valid angle.
           
           I will iterate through these angles.
