(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object 5**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5) on a defined surface (surface 0). The object's size and the surface's boundaries are provided. A stable placement means the object is fully contained within the surface's AABB.  Since the object is defined by its AABB extents, and the surface by an AABB, this translates to the requirement that for a given object center (x, y) and orientation (theta), the object's rotated AABB must remain inside the surface's AABB.
           
           To handle potential rotations, I need to consider the effective size of the object.  The object's rotated AABB will change based on the angle. The exact dimensions are critical; I need to use the provided `size_x` and `size_y` as they are. In the most general form, the rotated half-width and half-height for an angle theta:
           `hw_rot = hx * abs(cos(theta)) + hy * abs(sin(theta))` and
           `hh_rot = hx * abs(sin(theta)) + hy * abs(cos(theta))`
           
           where `hx = size_x/2` and `hy = size_y/2`. The surface 0 has a known AABB, including `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y`. To ensure containment, the object's center `(x, y)` needs to stay within a smaller AABB.
           
           For this problem, I'll generate a diverse set of placements to cover many positions and orientations likely to be stable.  To do this, I will use two different values for theta. First, I compute the valid area on the surface based on the object's rotated half-size based on the chosen value of theta.
           
           I'm generating the placements in two groups:
           1.  For `theta = 0.0`, the rotated object is axis-aligned, which minimizes the effective size (either side's half-size for `size_x==size_y` or half of `size_x` and half of `size_y` in general). This uses the full length `hx` along the axis as half-size.  I'll generate 25 positions with an equal spacing (0.1325 units) to obtain a dense filling of the valid area along `x` and `y` axes.
           2.  For `theta = pi/4` radians, the object is rotated 45 degrees, which maximizes its effective half-size at the surface, which is the sum `hx * math.sqrt(2)/2 + hy * math.sqrt(2)/2 = (hx+hy)*math.sqrt(2)/2`. This shrinks the valid area. I'll also generate 25 positions on a equally spaced grid using step 0.125251265.
           
           I will iterate over each x and y in my selected x and y grids and append the results to form a final list of 50 placements.
           The final placements are then formed into a list of tuples like `(surface_index, theta, x_center, y_center)`.

(Thoughts: **Placing Object 10 While Avoiding Collision with Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've received a request to place Object 10 (ID 10) on surface 0, given that Object 5 (ID 5) is already placed. I know Object 5 is located at  `(ID: 5) -- 0, 0.000000000000000, 4.235000000000014, -0.565000000000000`, which means it's on surface 0 at theta=0 and centered at approximately (4.235, -0.565). I also have Object 10's size (`0.08068` x `0.08068`). The surface extends from (4.2,-0.6) to (4.8,0.0).  The crucial rule is to avoid collisions with any previously placed object, in this case, Object 5.
           
           First, I need to define Object 5's properties to calculate its bounding box. I know Object 5's size is 0.07x0.07, and it's at theta=0, its center is at  (4.235, -0.565). Because it's at theta=0, the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) is aligned with the axes. I can calculate the corners of the box easily. It turns out Object 5 occupies the region from 4.2 to 4.27 on the x-axis and -0.6 to -0.53 on the y-axis, located at the bottom-left corner of the surface.
           
           Now, for Object 10, with size 0.08 x 0.08, I need to generate 50 stable placements, but crucially avoid collision with Object 5. I will start by using two rotation angle candidates: theta = 0, and theta = pi/4 (45 degrees).
           
           For theta=0, I calculate the valid x and y ranges for Object 10's center to ensure it stays within the surface. I also calculate half of object 10's size to use it for my calculations, which is around 0.04 for both x and y.
           
           To avoid collision, Object 10's AABB cannot overlap with Object 5's. I formalize the non-collision condition: either Object 10's center is sufficiently far to the right or above Object 5, or to the left or below Object 5. I calculate what distance the centers must be separated to avoid collisions. Using this formula, for theta=0, Object 10's center can't be at the bottom-left corner near Object 5.
           
           I will implement a grid to generate the first 25 points. I can divide the range into a 5x5 grid, and for each candidate position, I'll calculate the bounds of Object 10's AABB and check whether it overlaps Object 5's.
           If it overlaps, I will skip it.
           
           I derive the 25 points, and filtering them using the non-collision formula results in 24 placements that work (the point closest to object 5 collides).
           
           Next, I do the same thing for theta = pi/4. I recalculate valid ranges and do a similar grid-based approach. Again, I compute and filter the points based on the same collision conditions. As with theta=0, the points closest to Object 5 (around 0,0 index in the grid) will be removed, again resulting in 24 placements.
           
           In addition to 24 + 24 points, I need 2 more placements. I use two additional rotations to generate these positions. For theta = pi/2 and theta = 3*pi/4, I calculate the adjusted ranges. Since sizes in x and y are almost equal for Object 10, the range is almost the same as before.  For theta = pi/2, I add 2 more positions that are far away from Object 5.
           I can generate the placement in the top right and the middle of the surface which does not overlap object 5. Similarly, I can generate two placements for theta = 3*pi/4.
           
           Now, I have a total of 24 + 24 + 2 + 2 = 52. I need only 50. I can take the first 50.
           I've checked the geometry and ensured that the collision checks are correct.
