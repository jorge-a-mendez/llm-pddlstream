User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Finding the Optimal Robot Base Positions for Target Viewing**
           
           Alright, let's get down to business. I'm tasked with pinpointing three optimal base locations for our robot, all aimed at a specific `target_point`. Each position must be within a `max_range` of 2 units from the target, and the robot's orientation will automatically face the target. But here's the kicker: I need to ensure these positions are collision-free with all fixed obstacles and that there's a clear line-of-sight to the target, meaning no pesky obstructions getting in the way.
           
           My primary concern is this pesky central vertical wall situated at x = 0. Its presence fundamentally divides the scene into two halves, with the target point already residing on the left. Consequently, my chosen robot positions must also reside on the left side of this wall to maintain the necessary visual clarity. I've also noted other smaller obstacles scattered throughout the environment, including a significant rectangle just right of the bottom wall.
           
           Considering these constraints, I've mentally mapped the scene. The target is located in the lower-left area. To find suitable positions, I'll leverage a strategy prioritizing proximity to the target while ensuring line-of-sight. I’ll ensure positions are close enough to meet the `max_range = 2` requirement. I'll mentally check for any direct obstruction between the proposed robot location and the target.
           
           I've already crunched the numbers and settled on three potential base positions:
           
           1.  **P1:** -1.0183, -0.9723 (directly "above" the target, distance 1.0)
           2.  **P2:** -2.0790, -0.9117 (distance 1.5, slightly top-left of target)
           3.  **P3:** -1.9183, -0.4135 (distance 1.8, top-left of target)
           
           These positions have passed my line-of-sight analysis (including checking the critical central vertical wall) and collision checks. They are on the left side of the room, within range, and avoid potential overlaps with the obstacles. I'm confident that these three spots should provide the clear viewing angles required.
