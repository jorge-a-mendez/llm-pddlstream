User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is enclosed by walls at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5. There's a vertical wall along x=0. Several smaller obstacles are scattered throughout the scene. I will prioritize positions that are away from the known obstacles and walls, and try to maintain a good line-of-sight to the target. I will also try to vary the angle from which I view the target. Given the target point is {target_point}, I will first try to place the robot on the sides of the target.
           Positions:
           (2.321 0.771)
           (0.321 2.771)
           (0.321 -1.229)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     My previous attempts had some issues. (2.321, 0.771) collided with the wall at x=2.5. (0.321, 2.771) was out of bounds, I miscalculated the y coordinate. (0.321, -1.229) had no line of sight, likely due to the central wall at x=0. The target is at (-2.124, 1.875). I need to place the robot closer to the target, within the x and y bounds, and make sure I have line of sight, which means staying on the left side of the x=0 wall. I will try positions around the target, avoiding the walls and the central obstacle at x=0. I will prioritize positions within the target's quadrant (-x, +y).
           Positions:
           (-1.124 1.875)
           (-2.124 0.875)
           (-2.124 2.475)
