           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if `receivedimage` is true for v17, v18, and v19 with mode v11, `receivedanalysis` is true for v1 and v4 (type v2, stone), and `receivedanalysis` is true for v5, v7, and v8 (type v6, soil), and the rovers have free store v16 and are at their initial configurations.
           
           Looking at the initial state, rover v12 is at configuration v13 and rover v14 is at configuration v15. Both have free store v16. We need to achieve the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           
           For `receivedimage`:
           v17, v18, v19 need to be imaged and sent.
           - Both rovers v12 and v14 have `imagevisible` for v17, v18, v19 at configuration #o3 with ray #o4.
           - Both rovers have camera v10 onboard, and v10 supports mode v11.
           
           For `receivedanalysis`:
           v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8 are rocks. The goal specifies analysis for `type(?stone, v2)` and `type(?soil, v6)`.
           - Rocks of type v2: v1, v3, v4.
           - Rocks of type v6: v5, v7, v8.
           - All these rocks are `above` both rovers v12 and v14 at configuration #o5.
           
           For `send_analysis` and `send_image`:
           - Both rovers v12 and v14 have `comvisible` at configuration #o0 with ray #o1 to lander v9.
           
           We only have `move`, `drop_rock` actions available from the `valid_action_instances`. This means that any actions involving `take_image`, `calibrate`, `sample_rock`, `send_image`, `send_analysis` are not directly available to us. However, the goal `new-axiom@0()` requires these predicates to be true. This indicates that these predicates must already be true in the initial state or be derivable through the axioms.
           
           Let's re-examine the goal `new-axiom@0()`. It is an axiom which has the following conditions:
           `atconf(v12, v13)`
           `atconf(v14, v15)`
           `free(v12, v16)`
           `free(v14, v16)`
           `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           `type(?stone, v2)`
           `receivedanalysis(?stone)`
           `type(?soil, v6)`
           `receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           From the initial state:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` is true.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)` is true.
           - `free(v12, v16)` is true.
           - `free(v14, v16)` is true.
           
           The remaining parts of the goal are related to `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`. Since no actions are provided for `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`, the goal predicates `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` must already be true in the initial state, or the `new-axiom@0()` must be a simplified goal that can be true if the initial state contains the necessary elements.
           
           However, the initial state does NOT contain `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(v1)`, `receivedanalysis(v3)`, `receivedanalysis(v4)`, `receivedanalysis(v5)`, `receivedanalysis(v7)`, `receivedanalysis(v8)`.
           
           This is a critical observation. The provided "available action instances" only contain `move` and `drop_rock` actions. The goal explicitly requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates to be true. With only `move` and `drop_rock` actions available, there is no way to achieve `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`. Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the given set of allowed actions.
           
           The prompt specifies: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." and "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is *false*."
           
           Since the initial state does not contain the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates and there are no actions to achieve them, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable.
