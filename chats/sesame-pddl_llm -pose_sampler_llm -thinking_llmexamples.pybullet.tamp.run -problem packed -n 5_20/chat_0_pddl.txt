(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to provide 50 stable placements, represented as (surface_index, rotation_angle, x-coordinate, y-coordinate) tuples, for an object (ID 4) on a specified surface (index 0). The object is almost square (dimensions roughly 0.075 x 0.075), and the surface is a square of size 0.27 ([-0.135, -0.135] to [0.135, 0.135]).
           
           Given the object's geometry and the surface's symmetry, a simple strategy will be most effective. Since the object is nearly a square, varying its rotation angle (`theta`) will provide a diverse set of orientations.  Due to the surface being considerably larger than the object and centered at (0,0), placing the object at the center of the surface (0, 0) for *any* rotation angle is valid. The bounding box of the rotated object is always within the surface bounds.
           
           My approach is as follows:
           1.  **Angle Selection:** I will generate 50 rotation angles, `theta`, equally spaced between 0 and 2*pi (exclusive). Each angle will be `k * pi / 25` for k in 0...49, providing a small, systematic increment to ensure diversity in orientation.
           2.  **Center Placement:** For each selected `theta`, I will place the object at the center of the surface:  x = 0, y = 0.
           
           This strategy guarantees 50 stable placements, because the maximum extent of any rotation of the object is within the surface bounds, and each rotation provides distinct placement. The form of output required is: (surface_index, rotation_angle, x, y), for example, (0, 0, 0.0, 0.0).  The surface index for all placements will be 0.

(Thoughts: **My Solution for Placing Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed Object 4 at (0, 0) on Surface 0 with a rotation of 0. Now, I need to find 50 stable placements for Object 5, which is almost a perfect square, on the same surface, but crucially, *without colliding with Object 4*.
           
           Object 5's dimensions are almost identical, and Surface 0's dimensions are defined. I've already determined that Object 4 occupies a region centered at (0,0) with its extents (AABB). My approach here involves a few critical steps:
           
           1.  **Understanding Constraints:** First, I need to calculate the maximum safe placement area for Object 5 on Surface 0, accounting for its almost-square shape and possible rotation. This involves finding the maximum effective width and height given any possible rotation. Based on the provided dimensions, a rotation isn't an issue.
           2.  **Collision Avoidance (Key part):** The challenge is avoiding collision with Object 4. I've calculated Object 4's AABB extents. I've determined that due to object 5s' characteristics, I can only use a restricted range of angles (rotation) for placing object 5 (0 and pi).
           
           Based on the restrictions and calculations, I am generating 50 positions on the x-axis for placing object 5 to avoid overlap by placing the object outside the bounds of object 4. I can also put it on the other side of object 4 to get my 50 positions.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I need to place 50 instances of Object 6 (a near-square, ID:6) on Surface 0 (a square centered at the origin). My primary concern is avoiding collisions with existing obstacles: Object 4 (centered at the origin) and Object 5 (offset along the x-axis).
           
           **Understanding the Constraints:**
           
           *   **Surface Bounds:** Object 6's center must stay within a square of side 0.27.
           *   **Object Properties:** Object 6 has dimensions around 0.07 x 0.07. Its effective size (for collision detection) depends on its rotation.
           *   **Collision Detection:** I'll use AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) versus AABB collision checks for efficiency.
           
           **Collision Avoidance is Key:**
           
           The key to placement will be minimizing the effective AABB of Object 6.  I quickly realized that rotating Object 6 would *increase* its AABB and almost certainly cause collisions. Therefore, I will assume a rotation of zero degrees (theta = 0) to keep the object's footprint small.
           
           *   **Avoid Object 4:** Object 4 is at the origin and has a size around 0.075 x 0.075.  Object 6, with its rotation set to zero, requires a minimum distance between their centers to avoid collisions. I calculate that if I place object 6 at `y=0` I must put `x6` outside `x in (-0.07274662, 0.07274662)` if not, they will collide, and similarly, if I place object 6 at `x=0` then `abs(y) >= 0.07274662`.
           
           *   **Avoid Object 5:** Object 5 is positioned a bit down the x-axis. This one also needs the same checks as object 4, and, as with `y=0` it effectively cuts out a section on the `x` axis for all the placements that would collide, so I also need to make sure that the points that I pick are at a safe distance.
           
           **Placement Strategy (theta=0 degrees)**
           
           I will design the 50 placements based on the surface bounds and collision avoidance, resulting in 5 regions:
           
           1.  **Left Vertical Strip (12 points):** `x` coordinate fixed at the center of the free space near the left boundary (`-0.08630156`). The y-coordinates will have values within the boundaries of the square in order to not hit the other obstacle at the center of the surface.
           
           2.  **Top Horizontal Strip (12 points):** `y` coordinate set to `0.08630156`, with varied `x` values to ensure placements.
           
           3.  **Bottom Horizontal Strip (12 points):**  `y` coordinate set to `-0.08630156`, with varied `x` values.
           
           4.  **Right Top Strip (7 points):** A small band near the top-right corner.
           
           5.  **Right Bottom Strip (7 points):**  A corresponding small band near the bottom-right corner.
           
           I have performed a precise calculation for the exact placement of coordinates on the surface, and determined the total space of 50 objects in a way that minimizes the AABB. These calculations will be used in the final script. This placement strategy maximizes the number of placements while reliably avoiding collisions. All 50 placements are now planned.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm dealing with. I need to place 50 instances of "Object 7" on "Surface 0," and they can't bump into Objects 4, 5, or 6.  "Surface 0" is a simple rectangle centered at (0,0) with a half-dimension of 0.135 meters. Object 7 itself is almost a perfect square, with x and y dimensions roughly 0.077 meters. I need to ensure the placement is stable (e.g., within the surface boundaries).
           
           **Defining the Constraints**
           
           First, I examined possible rotations for Object 7.  I quickly realized that large rotations (like 45 degrees) would push the object's effective size past Object 4 and likely trigger collisions, so I'll be primarily using rotations of 0 or 90 degrees. This keeps the effective x and y dimensions constant at about 0.038 meters (half the x/y size).
           
           The key now is to map out the "forbidden zones" created by the existing objects.
           
           1.  **Surface Containment:**  "Object 7" must stay within the rectangle, so both its x and y coordinates need to be between -0.096 and 0.096.
           
           2.  **Object 4 Collision:** Object 4 is at the origin. I need to keep Object 7 away from it by at least 0.076 meters in both the x and y directions.
           
           3.  **Object 5 Collision:** Object 5 is positioned at (0.075, 0). I have to avoid a rectangle that effectively extends about 0.076 on either side of Object 5 in x, and also 0.076 above and below.
           
           4.  **Object 6 Collision:** Object 6 has a more complex positioning and must be avoided. The forbidden region I found is within a rectangle, but it has to be kept *outside*.
           
           **Developing a Placement Strategy**
           
           My plan is to create a set of coordinates by working around the borders and keeping them at specific distances, which is the safest approach.
           
           I started by visualizing a grid of potential locations, and I eliminated areas where I can't safely place the object. The "Forbidden" zones are the ones I have to skip. I will use the horizontal and vertical edges on the rectangle and make specific points on this outer layer to ensure there aren't any overlaps or collisions. I had to ensure that within specific coordinates there aren't collisions. I determined that the center part of the rectangle might be too crowded and difficult to put 50 safe locations, so I will start by focusing on the borders. By following the borders, I will be able to make 50 clean coordinates.
