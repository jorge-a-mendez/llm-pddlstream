           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers (v12 and v14), several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8), a lander (v9), a camera (v10), and a store (v16). There are also two objectives (v17, v18) and a mode (v11). Both rovers are initially at their respective configurations (v13 for v12, v15 for v14) and have the camera v10 onboard. The camera supports mode v11. Both rovers are free to sample into store v16. Various rocks are above certain configurations for both rovers. There are also image and communication visibility facts established for different configurations.
           
           The goal is to satisfy the axiom `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`
           3. `free(v12, v16)`
           4. `free(v14, v16)`
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           7. `type(?stone, v2)`
           8. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`
           9. `type(?soil, v6)`
           10. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           Let's check the initial state against these requirements:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: True
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: True
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: True
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: True
           
           The first four conditions are already met. We need to focus on conditions 5, 6, 8, and 10. These involve `receivedimage` for objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11, and `receivedanalysis` for a rock of type `v2` (stone) and a rock of type `v6` (soil).
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`:
           - We need to `take_image` first, which requires `calibrated` camera and `imagevisible`.
           - Then `send_image`, which requires `comvisible` and `haveimage`.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis`:
           - We need to `sample_rock`, which requires `above` and `free` store. This also sets `analyzed`.
           - Then `send_analysis`, which requires `comvisible` and `analyzed`.
           
           Looking at the available actions:
           - `move` actions are present, but the goal configurations are already met. So, moving is not strictly necessary unless a specific action requires a different configuration which can then be moved back to v13/v15. However, since the goal requires `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`, if we move, we would need to move back, but there are no move actions to return to these configurations. Since moving away from these configurations would violate the goal, we must assume that no move actions can be used for the rovers.
           - `drop_rock` actions are available but not directly useful since `free` is already true.
           
           Crucially, the provided action instances list only contains `move` and `drop_rock`. This means that `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` are NOT available as specific instances.
           
           Since the goal requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`, and no action instances are provided for `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`, it is impossible to achieve the parts of the goal that require these actions. The goal `new-axiom@0()` cannot be satisfied because steps 5, 6, 8, and 10 cannot be met without these actions.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
