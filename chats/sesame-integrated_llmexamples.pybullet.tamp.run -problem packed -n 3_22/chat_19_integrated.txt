           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.
           
           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q39', '#t109'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g12', '#q39', '#t103'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q39', '#q34', '#t114'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', 'p3', '#g12', '#q34', '#t98'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q34', '#q38', '#t112'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v12', 'v13', '#g13', '#q38', '#t102'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q38', '#q35', '#t110'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v12', 'p4', '#g13', '#q35', '#t99'))

           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v14', 'p5', '#g14', '#q36', '#t100'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-pose-pose:('v12', 'p4', 'v8', 'p3')->()`
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions. If the failure occurs after placing on any pose that does not start with '#', it may be due to using a combination of invalid poses.As the expert, you may decide to choose additional poses, providing their continuous values using any free pose starting with '#'. 

Model:     The goal is to place all three objects (v8, v12, v14) on the surface v16. Currently, v8 is at v9 (supported by v11), v12 is at v13 (supported by v11), and v14 is at v15 (supported by v11). The robot starts at v3 with hand empty.
           
           The previous plan failed because placing v12 at p4 caused a collision with v8 at p3. This means that p3 and p4 are too close to each other or overlap, given the bounding boxes of v8 and v12. We need to select different target poses on v16 for v8, v12, and v14 to avoid collisions.
           
           Since the goal is to place all three objects on v16, and we have multiple available poses supported by v16 (p3, p4, p9, p10, p12, p13, p15, p16, #o2 for all objects), we need to select three non-colliding poses for v8, v12, and v14.
           
           Let's check the given AABBs to estimate potential collisions for the given poses.
           v8 AABB = ((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035))
           v12 AABB = ((0.015, -0.035), (0.085, 0.035))
           v14 AABB = ((-0.055, -0.595), (0.04, -0.5))
           v16 AABB = ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)) (This seems like a small surface, maybe it's just a placeholder or for a small part of a larger surface. Given the initial state, v16 is used as a surface for placement)
           
           Given the previous failure, p3 and p4 are problematic.
           p3: (0.0, 0.0, 0.782)
           p4: (0.05, 0.0, 0.782)
           Placing v8 at p3 and v12 at p4 puts them close. The bounding box of v8 is centered at p3, so it covers x from -0.035 to 0.035. The bounding box of v12 is (0.015, -0.035) to (0.085, 0.035), so if its reference point (p4) is (0.05, 0.0), then it covers x from (0.05+0.015) = 0.065 to (0.05+0.085) = 0.135. This should not collide based on x coordinates if both objects are oriented the same. However, without knowing the actual shape and how the pose applies to the AABB, it's hard to be certain. Given the failure, they must collide.
           
           Let's try to find poses that are sufficiently separated.
           v16 has poses: p3, p4, p9, p10, p12, p13, p15, p16, and #o2.
           
           Consider using p3, p9, and p15 for v8, v12, and v14 on v16. These are all on v16.
           p3: (0.0, 0.0, 0.782)
           p9: (0.0, 0.0, 0.782) (Same as p3) - This means they must collide.
           p15: (0.0, 0.0, 0.782) (Same as p3 and p9) - This means they all collide.
           
           Okay, the issue is that many of the given poses (p3, p9, p12, p15, p4, p10, p13, p16) have very similar x, y, z coordinates.
           p3: (0.0, 0.0, 0.782)
           p4: (0.05, 0.0, 0.782)
           p5: (-0.05, 0.0, 0.782)
           p9: (0.0, 0.0, 0.782)
           p10: (0.05, 0.05, 0.782)
           p11: (-0.05, 0.05, 0.782)
           p12: (0.0, 0.0, 0.782)
           p13: (0.05, 0.05, 0.782)
           p14: (-0.05, 0.05, 0.782)
           p15: (0.0, 0.0, 0.782)
           p16: (0.05, 0.0, 0.782)
           p17: (-0.05, 0.0, 0.782)
           
           This means that we have to use the continuous pose #o2, and place the objects further apart on the surface v16 if the other given poses are colliding.
           
           Let's use the object v16 as the target surface. Its AABB is ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Let's define three poses on v16 for v8, v12, and v14 such that they don't collide.
           v8 AABB = ((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035)) - total width 0.07, height 0.07
           v12 AABB = ((0.015, -0.035), (0.085, 0.035)) - total width 0.07, height 0.07 (relative to reference point)
           v14 AABB = ((-0.055, -0.595), (0.04, -0.5)) - total width 0.095, height 0.095 (relative to reference point)
           
           Let's try to place them along the x-axis of v16, assuming v16 is centered at (0,0).
           Available range for x on v16: -0.135 to 0.135. Total width 0.27.
           Available range for y on v16: -0.135 to 0.135. Total width 0.27.
           
           Let's place v8 at #o2, v12 at p16, and v14 at p17 on v16.
           v8 at #o2 (new pose)
           v12 at p16: (0.05, 0.0, 0.782)
           v14 at p17: (-0.05, 0.0, 0.782)
           
           If v12 is at p16 (0.05, 0.0), its x-range is roughly (0.05+0.015) to (0.05+0.085) = 0.065 to 0.135.
           If v14 is at p17 (-0.05, 0.0), its x-range is roughly (-0.05-0.055) to (-0.05+0.04) = -0.105 to -0.01.
           These two seem collision-free in x.
           
           For v8 at #o2, let's pick a pose that is in the middle, say (0.0, 0.0, 0.782).
           v8 at (0.0, 0.0, 0.782) - x-range is -0.035 to 0.035.
           This would collide with v14 at p17.
           
           We need to make sure the poses are actually distinct and non-colliding on v16. Let's create specific poses for #o2.
           Let's target:
           v8 at #o2_v8_pose: (0.0, 0.0, 0.782) (this would be centered in v16)
           v12 at p16: (0.05, 0.0, 0.782)
           v14 at p17: (-0.05, 0.0, 0.782)
           As noted, v8 at (0,0) with x-span [-0.035, 0.035] would collide with v14 whose x-span for p17 is [-0.105, -0.01]. Let's try to spread them more in the y-direction or across the x-axis.
           
           Let's try to place them in the following order:
           1. Pick v8 from v9 and place it at p15 on v16. (p15: 0.0, 0.0, 0.782)
           2. Pick v12 from v13 and place it at p16 on v16. (p16: 0.05, 0.0, 0.782)
           3. Pick v14 from v15 and place it at p17 on v16. (p17: -0.05, 0.0, 0.782)
           
           Let's recheck collision:
           v8 at p15 (0.0, 0.0, 0.782). v8_x_span = [-0.035, 0.035]
           v12 at p16 (0.05, 0.0, 0.782). v12_x_span = [0.05+0.015, 0.05+0.085] = [0.065, 0.135]
           v14 at p17 (-0.05, 0.0, 0.782). v14_x_span = [-0.05-0.055, -0.05+0.04] = [-0.105, -0.01]
           
           Based on these rough estimations, the x-spans are non-overlapping:
           v14: [-0.105, -0.01]
           v8: [-0.035, 0.035]
           v12: [0.065, 0.135]
           This seems to work in terms of x-coordinates. All objects are within the v16 AABB x-range [-0.135, 0.135].
           For y-coordinates:
           v8: [-0.035, 0.035] (centered at 0)
           v12: [-0.035, 0.035] (centered at 0)
           v14: [-0.595, -0.5] (relative to ref point, which is at y=0, so its y span would be [-0.595, -0.5]) This is very far from the center y. This needs more careful interpretation.
           
           Given `pose(obj, pose_name)` has position (x,y,z), the AABB is defined *relative to this position*.
           So for v14 at p17 (-0.05, 0.0, 0.782), its absolute AABB min/max would be:
           x: -0.05 - 0.055 = -0.105, -0.05 + 0.04 = -0.01
           y: 0.0 - 0.595 = -0.595, 0.0 - 0.5 = -0.5
           This means v14 would be placed far down on the y-axis, well outside the v16 AABB's y-range ([-0.135, 0.135]). So, p17 is not a suitable pose for v14 on v16.
           
           This indicates that the existing 'p' poses are mostly for a small region around (0,0,0.782).
           We will need to use #o2 for at least two objects and provide specific coordinate values for them to ensure separation on v16.
           Since p15 and p16 are on v16, we can use them for two objects, and #o2 for the third one, giving it specific coordinates to avoid collision.
           
           Let's use the right arm (v4).
           Object v8 is at v9.
           Object v12 is at v13.
           Object v14 is at v15.
           
           Goal: v8 on v16, v12 on v16, v14 on v16.
           Surface v16 AABB: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Let's place:
           - v8 at p15 (on v16). This is (0.0, 0.0, 0.782).
           - v12 at p16 (on v16). This is (0.05, 0.0, 0.782).
           - v14 needs a new pose. Let's use #o2 and define it.
             For v14, we need an x between -0.135 and 0.135.
             AABB of v14: ((-0.055, -0.595), (0.04, -0.5)). The object seems to extend far in the negative y direction.
             If the y-range of v14 is [-0.595, -0.5] relative to its pose, and the y-range of v16 is [-0.135, 0.135], then no matter what pose y we pick, v14's AABB will not be contained within v16's y-range. This suggests a problem in interpretation or that v14 can't be placed on v16 if its AABB is absolute, or the AABB is relative to a different point than the pose.
           
           Assuming the AABB is relative to the object's origin, and the pose is for that origin, then for v14 to be supported by v16, its AABB must fit within v16's AABB.
           For v14 AABB = ((-0.055, -0.595), (0.04, -0.5)), its total dimensions are 0.095 in x and 0.095 in y.
           v16 has dimensions 0.27 in x and 0.27 in y.
           So v14 *can* fit on v16, but the AABB values ((-0.055, -0.595), (0.04, -0.5)) indicate that the origin of the object might not be at the center of the bounding box.
           If the pose coordinates (x_pose, y_pose) define the reference point for the AABB, then the actual space occupied by the object is (x_pose + minx_aabb, x_pose + maxx_aabb) for x, and (y_pose + miny_aabb, y_pose + maxy_aabb) for y.
           For v14, `y_pose + miny_aabb = y_pose - 0.595`. For this to be within [-0.135, 0.135], `y_pose - 0.595 >= -0.135` and `y_pose - 0.5 <= 0.135`.
           `y_pose >= -0.135 + 0.595 = 0.46`.
           `y_pose <= 0.135 + 0.5 = 0.635`.
           So, the y-coordinate of the pose for v14 must be between 0.46 and 0.635 for it to be on v16.
           
           Let's recalculate for v8 and v12 as well.
           v8 AABB = ((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035))
           Dimensions: 0.07 x 0.07.
           For v8 at (x_pose, y_pose, z_pose) on v16:
           x_pose - 0.035 >= -0.135 => x_pose >= -0.1
           x_pose + 0.035 <= 0.135 => x_pose <= 0.1
           y_pose - 0.035 >= -0.135 => y_pose >= -0.1
           y_pose + 0.035 <= 0.135 => y_pose <= 0.1
           So for v8, x_pose and y_pose should be between -0.1 and 0.1.
           p15 (0.0, 0.0, 0.782) is good for v8.
           
           v12 AABB = ((0.015, -0.035), (0.085, 0.035))
           Dimensions: 0.07 x 0.07.
           For v12 at (x_pose, y_pose, z_pose) on v16:
           x_pose + 0.015 >= -0.135 => x_pose >= -0.15
           x_pose + 0.085 <= 0.135 => x_pose <= 0.05
           y_pose - 0.035 >= -0.135 => y_pose >= -0.1
           y_pose + 0.035 <= 0.135 => y_pose <= 0.1
           So for v12, x_pose should be between -0.15 and 0.05, and y_pose between -0.1 and 0.1.
           p16 (0.05, 0.0, 0.782) is exactly on the boundary for x_pose (0.05 <= 0.05). This might cause collision issues.
           
           Let's pick new poses for all three objects using #o2.
           Let the z-coordinate be 0.782 for all.
           For v8 (x,y in [-0.1, 0.1]): Let's pick (-0.08, 0.0, 0.782) for #o2_v8_pose.
             x range: [-0.115, -0.045]. y range: [-0.035, 0.035].
           For v12 (x in [-0.15, 0.05], y in [-0.1, 0.1]): Let's pick (0.04, 0.0, 0.782) for #o2_v12_pose.
             x range: [0.04+0.015, 0.04+0.085] = [0.055, 0.125]. y range: [-0.035, 0.035].
           For v14 (x in [-0.095, 0.095], y in [0.46, 0.635]): Let's pick (0.0, 0.5, 0.782) for #o2_v14_pose.
             x range: [-0.055, 0.04]. y range: [0.0 - 0.595 + 0.5, 0.0 - 0.5 + 0.5] = [-0.095, 0.0]. (This calculation for y_pose is incorrect, the AABB is added to the pose's y coordinate.)
             Let's re-calculate y for v14:
             y_pose + min_y <= max_surf_y => y_pose - 0.595 <= 0.135 => y_pose <= 0.73
             y_pose + max_y >= min_surf_y => y_pose - 0.5 >= -0.135 => y_pose >= 0.365
             So for v14, y_pose should be in [0.365, 0.73].
             Let's choose (0.0, 0.4, 0.782) for #o2_v14_pose. This is within the calculated range.
             x range: [-0.055, 0.04]. y range: [0.4-0.595, 0.4-0.5] = [-0.195, -0.1].
             The y range [-0.195, -0.1] is NOT within [-0.135, 0.135]. So (0.0, 0.4, 0.782) will not work.
           
           The definition of the AABB and its interaction with the pose coordinates needs to be clarified. If the AABB describes the object's extent *relative to its center*, and the pose is the center, then the previous calculation for v14's y-pose was wrong. However, if the AABB coordinates are *relative to the pose itself* (meaning the pose is the (0,0) for the AABB), then the first set of calculations was right. The problem statement says "axis-aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy)))", which implies relative to some origin. Let's assume it's relative to the object's pose.
           
           Given the small AABB for v16 (0.27x0.27), and the AABB for v14 (y-range of 0.095), it seems likely that the 'on' predicate means that the object's AABB (relative to its pose) must be fully contained within the surface's AABB (relative to its origin, which we can assume is (0,0) for v16 based on how poses are defined for other objects).
           
           Let's assume the poses (p3, p4, etc.) are valid if the object's AABB fits inside v16 when its origin is at that pose.
           For v14, if its AABB relative to the origin is ((-0.055, -0.595), (0.04, -0.5)), then the object extends from -0.055 to 0.04 in x and -0.595 to -0.5 in y. For it to be fully contained in v16, for instance, at a pose (x, y, z):
           x + (-0.055) >= -0.135 => x >= -0.08
           x + (0.04) <= 0.135 => x <= 0.095
           y + (-0.595) >= -0.135 => y >= 0.46
           y + (-0.5) <= 0.135 => y <= 0.635
           So, the pose for v14 must have x in [-0.08, 0.095] and y in [0.46, 0.635].
           None of the existing 'p' poses (which have y around 0.0 or 0.05) would work for v14 to be on v16 based on this interpretation. This means that either the AABB interpretation is wrong, or v14 cannot be placed on v16. However, `stackable(v14, v16)` and `supported(v14, p5, v16)` exist, so it must be possible.
           
           The problem implies that 'supported' facts already tell us that certain object-pose-surface combinations are valid.
           `supported(v14, p5, v16)` means p5 is a valid pose for v14 on v16.
           p5 coordinates: (-0.05, 0.0, 0.782).
           This contradicts my manual AABB calculation for v14 on v16, where y had to be in [0.46, 0.635]. This implies that either the AABB given for v14 is not what is used for collision checking, or `v16` is a symbolic name for a larger surface, and the AABB for `v16` provided is not the complete one, or the AABB is centered at the object's pose. If the AABB is centered, then for v14 (width 0.095, height 0.095), its center must be within [-0.135 + 0.095/2, 0.135 - 0.095/2] for both x and y, i.e., roughly [-0.0875, 0.0875].
           
           Given the `supported` facts, let's trust those pre-computed valid poses.
           `supported(v8, p3, v16)`
           `supported(v12, p4, v16)`
           `supported(v14, p5, v16)`
           The previous plan failed because `test-cfree-pose-pose:('v12', 'p4', 'v8', 'p3')->()`.
           So, placing v8 at p3 and v12 at p4 simultaneously causes a collision.
           We need to pick *three* non-colliding poses for v8, v12, v14 from the available poses *supported by v16*.
           
           The available poses *supported by v16* are:
           v8: p3, p9, p12, p15, #o2
           v12: p4, p10, p13, p16, #o2
           v14: p5, p11, p14, p17, #o2
           
           Let's try to arrange them such that they are separated on v16.
           Available specific poses:
           p3: (0.0, 0.0, 0.782)
           p4: (0.05, 0.0, 0.782)
           p5: (-0.05, 0.0, 0.782)
           p9: (0.0, 0.0, 0.782) (Same as p3)
           p10: (0.05, 0.05, 0.782)
           p11: (-0.05, 0.05, 0.782)
           p12: (0.0, 0.0, 0.782) (Same as p3)
           p13: (0.05, 0.05, 0.782) (Same as p10)
           p14: (-0.05, 0.05, 0.782) (Same as p11)
           p15: (0.0, 0.0, 0.782) (Same as p3)
           p16: (0.05, 0.0, 0.782) (Same as p4)
           p17: (-0.05, 0.0, 0.782) (Same as p5)
           
           This means we effectively only have 5 distinct poses:
           P_center = (0.0, 0.0, 0.782) - for v8 (p3, p9, p12, p15)
           P_right_center = (0.05, 0.0, 0.782) - for v12 (p4, p16)
           P_left_center = (-0.05, 0.0, 0.782) - for v14 (p5, p17)
           P_right_top = (0.05, 0.05, 0.782) - for v12 (p10, p13)
           P_left_top = (-0.05, 0.05, 0.782) - for v14 (p11, p14)
           
           The previous plan failed with v8 at P_center (p3) and v12 at P_right_center (p4). This implies these two collide.
           So, we cannot use P_center and P_right_center simultaneously.
           Also, P_center and P_left_center are likely to collide too.
           P_right_center and P_left_center might also collide, or be too close.
           P_right_top and P_left_top are also very close.
           
           We need three distinct and non-colliding spots on v16. Since the predefined poses are problematic due to collisions, we *must* use #o2 for some objects and define new, separated poses.
           
           Let's use #o2 for all three objects. Let's make three widely separated poses on v16.
           v16 AABB = ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           Let's define three poses to be used by #o2 for v8, v12, v14.
           We need to be careful about the object's relative AABBs.
           Assuming the object's AABB describes its extent from its geometric center.
           v8: centered at pose, extends by 0.035 in all directions. So its center (pose) needs to be within [-0.135+0.035, 0.135-0.035] = [-0.1, 0.1].
           v12: not centered. Extends by [0.015, 0.085] in x and [-0.035, 0.035] in y from its pose.
             So its pose's x needs to be within [-0.135-0.015, 0.135-0.085] = [-0.15, 0.05].
             Its pose's y needs to be within [-0.135+0.035, 0.135-0.035] = [-0.1, 0.1].
           v14: not centered. Extends by [-0.055, 0.04] in x and [-0.595, -0.5] in y from its pose.
             So its pose's x needs to be within [-0.135- (-0.055), 0.135 - 0.04] = [-0.08, 0.095].
             Its pose's y needs to be within [-0.135- (-0.595), 0.135 - (-0.5)] = [0.46, 0.635].
           This confirms the y-coordinate for v14 needs to be significantly higher than 0.
           
           This is a critical insight: The existing poses such as p3, p4, p5 (y around 0) will NOT work for v14 on v16.
           So, any plan that places v14 on p5, p11, p14, or p17 (all of which have y-coordinates of 0.0 or 0.05) cannot be executable on v16 because these poses are not valid for v14 on v16 based on the AABB calculation. The fact that `supported(v14, p5, v16)` is provided implies my AABB interpretation is wrong, or the task wants me to ignore the AABB when `supported` is given.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the problem. The `supported` predicates are given. I should trust those.
           `supported(v8, p3, v16)` (valid)
           `supported(v12, p4, v16)` (valid)
           `supported(v14, p5, v16)` (valid)
           
           The previous error `test-cfree-pose-pose:('v12', 'p4', 'v8', 'p3')->()` clearly indicates that placing v12 at p4 and v8 at p3 leads to a collision.
           So we need to change at least one of these two.
           
           Let's try to use these three specific poses that are supported by v16, but assign them to objects in a way that minimizes collision. We only have 5 distinct locations on v16 from the pre-computed poses.
           P_center = (0.0, 0.0, 0.782) - can be used for v8.
           P_right_center = (0.05, 0.0, 0.782) - can be used for v12.
           P_left_center = (-0.05, 0.0, 0.782) - can be used for v14.
           P_right_top = (0.05, 0.05, 0.782) - can be used for v12.
           P_left_top = (-0.05, 0.05, 0.782) - can be used for v14.
           
           The previous failure was: v8 at p3 (P_center) and v12 at p4 (P_right_center).
           Let's try:
           1. v8 at p15 (P_center)
           2. v12 at p10 (P_right_top)
           3. v14 at p11 (P_left_top)
           
           Let's look at the coordinates of these chosen poses:
           v8 at p15: (0.0, 0.0, 0.782)
           v12 at p10: (0.05, 0.05, 0.782)
           v14 at p11: (-0.05, 0.05, 0.782)
           
           These three poses are distinct. They form a small triangle. Let's see if this configuration avoids collision.
           P_center and P_right_top are separated by 0.05 in x and 0.05 in y.
           P_center and P_left_top are separated by 0.05 in x and 0.05 in y.
           P_right_top and P_left_top are separated by 0.1 in x.
           
           This arrangement provides more separation than (P_center, P_right_center).
           Let's try this plan.
           
           Initial state:
           v3 atbconf
           v4 handempty, ataconf v5
           v8 atpose v9
           v12 atpose v13
           v14 atpose v15
           
           Plan:
           1. Move base to a suitable configuration (#o3) for picking v8.
           2. Pick v8 from v9 using #o1 grasp, #o3 bconf, #o4 traj.
           3. Move base to a suitable configuration (#o3) for placing v8 at p15.
           4. Place v8 at p15 using #o1 grasp, #o3 bconf, #o4 traj.
           5. Move base to a suitable configuration (#o3) for picking v12.
           6. Pick v12 from v13 using #o1 grasp, #o3 bconf, #o4 traj.
           7. Move base to a suitable configuration (#o3) for placing v12 at p10.
           8. Place v12 at p10 using #o1 grasp, #o3 bconf, #o4 traj.
           9. Move base to a suitable configuration (#o3) for picking v14.
           10. Pick v14 from v15 using #o1 grasp, #o3 bconf, #o4 traj.
           11. Move base to a suitable configuration (#o3) for placing v14 at p11.
           12. Place v14 at p11 using #o1 grasp, #o3 bconf, #o4 traj.
           
           The base configurations (#o3) and arm trajectories (#o4) are computed internally. The question states that any specific objects like v32, v33, v34, v35, v36, v37, v38, v51, v52, v53 are generic parameters for `kin` predicates. We should stick to the specific object names for the action arguments. The object #o1 is the grasp.
           
           The action instances provided use #o3 for bconf and #o4 for atraj.
           The available `kin` instances use `v4` (arm), `v8`, `v12`, `v14` (objects), various poses, `#o1` (grasp), `#o3` (bconf), `#o4` (atraj).
           This means that for all pick/place actions, the base configuration will be #o3 and the arm trajectory will be #o4.
           This simplifies things, as we don't need to specify different base configurations or trajectories.
           
           --Plan--:
           (move_base v3 #o3 #o0)
           (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v8 p15 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v12 p10 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v14 p11 #o1 #o3 #o4)
