(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation for Object 5**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to generate 50 stable placements for object 5 on surface 0. My goal is to maximize the object's presence on the surface by utilizing different rotations.
           
           I'm starting with a fundamental understanding: the object's geometry is defined by an AABB (0.07 x 0.07). The crucial point here is how this AABB behaves with rotation. Since the problem explicitly mentions the AABB, I'm interpreting "geometry of the object [...] described in terms of [...] AABB" to mean that I must compute the *effective* AABB dimensions when the object is rotated, because "object is fully contained within the bounds of the surface."
           
           Surface 0 is defined as ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  It measures 0.6 units in both width and height.
           
           I'm considering two distinct rotations for the square object: 0 radians (no rotation) and pi/4 radians (45 degrees rotation).  With the object being a square and AABB dimensions provided, rotating further doesn't provide more variation. With the given dimensions and surface size, this approach should cover most situations.
           
           *   **Rotation of 0 radians:** The effective AABB remains 0.07 x 0.07. The valid center coordinates range from (4.235, -0.565) to (4.765, -0.035). That's surface minus half of the object on all sides.
           *   **Rotation of pi/4 radians (45 degrees):** The effective AABB expands to 0.07 * sqrt(2) x 0.07 * sqrt(2) (approximately 0.09899 x 0.09899).  This also assumes full rotation and does not need other rotations.  This results in a smaller valid center range, between (4.24949747, -0.55050253) and (4.75050253, -0.04949747).
           
           I'll generate a grid of 5 x 5 equally spaced points within each valid center range.  Since I have two rotations and each has 25 placements each, I get 50 placements. No collisions need to be avoided.
           
           To summarise: I'm calculating the effective AABB's dimensions for different rotations and then creating a 5x5 grid of valid x and y coordinates centered on surface 0 using two rotations to generate a diverse set of possible and stable placements.
