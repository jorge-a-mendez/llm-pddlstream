User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           v15: object
           v16: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.658, 0.305), (-4.576, 0.387)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.617, 0.346, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.995, -0.097).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Path to New Axiom**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially means I need to get object `v8` onto object `v18`, and `v8` must have a specific type.  I can see that in the initial state, `v8` has the correct type.  Therefore, I'm focusing on the "on" part: getting `v8` physically positioned *on* `v18`.
           
           To do this, I've got to use my arm. Initially, `v8` is at `v9`.  The initial conditions give me the hint that the object `v8` can be placed at pose `#o2` on `v18`. From the given knowledge, the only way to get `v8` onto `#o2` is to pick it up and place it.  So, I will formulate the following plan:
           
           1.  **Pick:** Use arm `v4` to pick up `v8` from its current pose `v9`.
           2.  **Place:** Use arm `v4` to place `v8` onto `v18` at pose `#o2`.
           
           Now, the important part:  the actions are only valid with specific preconditions.  Let's verify them:
           
           *   **Pick Preconditions**:
               *   I need to ensure the robot arm can perform the *kinematics* of picking up the object.  From the knowledge base, I can use the existing `kin` facts. I have an applicable `kin` relationship `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`.
               *   `v8` must be *at* `v9`, which is true.
               *   My hand must be *empty* to begin.  That's true as well.
               *   I'll need the correct base configuration to perform the `pick` move. The only base configuration I have is `v3`, which is valid for my current kinematics.
               *   No *unsafe* conditions, like collisions, are explicitly defined for this pick and I will assume none exist.
           
           *   **Place Preconditions**:
               *   I need an `kin` fact for placing `v8` *at* `#o2`.  I have `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`.
               *   I need to have already picked `v8` up, so the *grasp* fact must be valid. From the `pick` action, I can infer that I'm grasping the object `v8`.
               *   I need to use the base configuration `v3`.
               *   I also need no unsafe pose or collisions.
           
           Once those actions are completed, I know `v8` will be at `#o2` and the goal will be satisfied. Since the base configuration is valid, and no other base configurations are provided, I can infer I don't need to move the base.
           
           For the pose `#o2`, given the dimensions of both objects, I will place the object `v8` at the center of the surface `v18` (which is within its range), and at a suitable height on `v18` with 0 rotation.
           
           I've checked the state, the goal will be achieved and the total cost for my plan is 2 which is minimum.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a goal, `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to needing object `?green` to be *on* `v18` and of type `v17`. Looking at the initial state, I've got `type(v8, v17)` already, so I just need to get `v8` onto `v18`.  Easy, right?
           
           Well, not exactly. My understanding of "on" means `v8` needs to be supported *and* in the correct pose to be on `v18`. Initially, I see `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `pose(v8, #o2)` which seems great! But, a crucial problem has surfaced.  `v8` is *currently* at `v9`, not at `#o2`. I need to change that. I've been thinking about this for a while, and the typical actions I'd reach for are `pick` and `place` to move `v8` to `#o2`.
           
           However, the feedback I got said `pick` and `place` are off-limits; the only action allowed is `move_base`. `move_base` is only about changing the robot's base position. It *can't* manipulate objects directly. So, I'm stuck: I can't directly change the *pose* of `v8` from `v9` to `#o2` with *only* the ability to move the robot's base.
           
           Given these constraints and what I know of planning and manipulation, the conclusion is clear: with only the `move_base` action available, the goal is *unreachable*. I simply can't achieve `on(v8, v18)`.
