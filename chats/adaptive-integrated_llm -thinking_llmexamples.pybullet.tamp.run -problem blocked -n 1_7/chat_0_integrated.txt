User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.658, 0.305), (-4.576, 0.387)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.617, 0.346, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.995, -0.097).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning about Goal Achievement**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: achieving `(new-axiom@0)`, which boils down to having an object of type `v17` be *on* `v18`. From the initial state, I know that `v8` and `v12` have the required type. So, I need either `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           The definition of `on` relies on `supported` and `atpose` predicates. Looking at the initial state, the only way to support something on `v18` is at pose `#o2`. Thus, to achieve `on(v8, v18)`, I need `atpose(v8, #o2)`, and similarly, to get `on(v12, v18)`, I'd require `atpose(v12, #o2)`.
           
           Currently, `v8` is at `v9`, and `v12` is at `v13`.  My plan involves *moving* either of these objects to `#o2`.  This requires a `pick` action to grasp the object and then a `place` action to put it in the desired position.
           
           But here's the catch: the *only* action I'm *allowed* to use is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This does *nothing* to change the `atpose` or `on` predicates. It's a dummy base motion!
           
           The instruction explicitly states that only the provided action instances are permissible. No `pick` or `place` actions are listed.
           
           Therefore, since the only possible way to achieve the goal involves actions I *can't* use, I have to conclude that the goal is *unachievable* within the given constraints. I cannot create a valid plan.
