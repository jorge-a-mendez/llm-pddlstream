           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, both at their initial configurations `v13` and `v15` respectively. Both rovers have a camera `v10` onboard that supports mode `v11`. There are several rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`) and objectives (`v17`, `v18`). There is also a lander `v9`. Both rovers have a free storage `v16`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be expanded to:
           `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)`, `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `type(?stone, v2)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, `type(?soil, v6)`, `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           From the initial state, we already have:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`
           - `free(v12, v16)`
           - `free(v14, v16)`
           
           So, the remaining subgoals are:
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for some rock of type `v2`
           - `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for some rock of type `v6`
           
           From the initial state, we have rocks of type `v2` (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`) and type `v6` (`v5`, `v7`, `v8`).
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           1. Calibrate a camera (`v10`) for either rover (`v12` or `v14`) at a visible configuration with respect to the objective (`v17` or `v18`).
           2. Take an image of the objective (`v17` or `v18`) using the calibrated camera and supported mode (`v11`).
           3. Send the image to the lander (`v9`).
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`:
           1. Sample a rock of type `v2` and a rock of type `v6`.
           2. Send the analysis of these sampled rocks to the lander (`v9`).
           
           Let's break it down further based on available actions. Only `move` and `drop_rock` actions are explicitly given as valid. This significantly limits the actions we can perform. Since we cannot perform `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`, and these are essential to achieve the remaining goals, it seems the goal `new-axiom@0()` is *not* achievable with the given set of allowed actions, unless the goal is already satisfied by the initial state and axioms which is not the case here since `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` are not true.
           
           Let's re-evaluate. The goal `new-axiom@0()` implies that `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for some rock of type `v2`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for some rock of type `v6` must be true. None of these are true in the initial state. The available actions are only `move` and `drop_rock`. None of these actions can achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
