           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning on Achieving `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, so the task at hand is to figure out a plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()` in this `pr2-tamp` domain.  I can break this down.  `new-axiom@0()` boils down to two subgoals: `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. Straightforward. I know from examining the initial state that objects `v8` and `v12` satisfy the `type` predicate.  So, either one could be my `?green`.
           
           Now, the `on` predicate requires `supported(?green, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(?green, ?p)`. Let's look at the initial state: Both `v8` and `v12` are supported somewhere, but not on `v18`.  `v8` is `supported` by `v11` and also supported by `#o2`. If only it was at `#o2` instead of `v9`. Similarly, `v12` is supported by `v14` and also supported by `#o2`.  If only it was at `#o2` instead of `v13`.
           
           The core of the problem then is manipulating the poses of these objects, `v8` and `v12`, to satisfy the supporting and atpose predicates required for `on(?green, v18)`. That means I need to "move" one of them to `#o2`.
           
           However, the action instance I'm given is a `move_base` action. This doesn't involve object manipulation, it only moves the robot's base. It's useless for changing object poses!  I'm missing the crucial `pick` and `place` actions that I know are required to manipulate objects in this sort of domain.
           
           I checked what `on` conditions are already true in the initial state and can see that `v8` is on `v11` and `v12` is on `v14`. This highlights the discrepancy, and therefore the need to manipulate objects.
           
           Given this limited action set, I have to conclude that reaching `on(?green, v18)` is *impossible*. Neither `v8` nor `v12` is *currently* `on v18`, and there's no way to *make* them so, with the only action available. I cannot change the world state with the provided operator. The goal is unreachable given the current world state and constraints.
