           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Goal Reachability**
           
           Okay, here's what I've figured out. My goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object, let's call it *green*, that's both *on* something (`v18`) and has a certain *type* (`v17`). It's fairly straightforward to see that *v8* fits the bill for *green* in terms of type. So the real challenge is getting *v8* *on v18*.
           
           To be *on* something means it's supported and in the right pose. I see that *v8* is *supported* by `#o2` and `v18`. From the initial conditions, it follows that to satisfy *on(v8, v18)*, I just need to get *v8* *at pose* `#o2`.
           
           Now, here's where things get tricky. *v8* is currently *at pose* `v9`. I need to move it from `v9` to `#o2`. To do that, I'd need to *pick* it up and *place* it. But the only action I have at my disposal is *move_base v3 v3 #o0*.  It literally moves the robot's base... to the *same* location. Useless!
           
           The problem is the lack of *pick* and *place* actions, or, crucially, any `kin` facts that would make these actions possible. `kin` is the key to executing pick-and-place; it describes the robot's ability to actually grasp and move objects. I've got none of that.
           
           Without the necessary object manipulation capabilities (and I can't even "move a brick"), I can't change the pose of *v8* from its current location to the desired pose `#o2`. Because I can't move the *green* object into the correct configuration, I can't satisfy the *on* predicate and, thus, I can't achieve the overall goal of `new-axiom@0()`. The goal is therefore unreachable given the currently available actions. I need the ability to *pick* and *place* objects, or at least a way to establish these actions are feasible.
