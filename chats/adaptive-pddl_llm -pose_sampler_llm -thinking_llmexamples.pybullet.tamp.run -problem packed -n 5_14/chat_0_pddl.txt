(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to create 50 stable placements of a square object on a square surface.  I've broken this down into these key steps, leveraging my understanding of geometry and bounding boxes.
           
           First, I need to ensure that the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) remains *fully contained* within the surface's AABB after rotation. This containment is the definition of a "stable" placement.  Since the object is a square, its effective size for containment varies with the rotation angle (theta).  The initial, axis-aligned dimensions `size_x` and `size_y` don't directly tell me this.  I need to calculate the *world-aligned* AABB dimensions.
           
           For a square of side *S*, the half-dimensions are *S/2*. When rotated by *theta*, the half-width and half-height of the new AABB are both (S/2) * (|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|).  This means the "effective" bounding box size is largest at 45-degree angles (where the new AABB's diagonal is used) and smallest when aligned with the axes. I need to calculate this `half_bbox_dim`.
           
           I know the surface's dimensions, so I can figure out the maximum x and y coordinates, given the rotated object's dimensions and `half_bbox_dim`.
           
           Now I need to generate placements. To ensure a diverse spread of placements, I'll use several rotation angles and calculate the range of possible center point coordinates for each angle.  The key is to select angles strategically; I will take a 0 to 2*pi range and calculate `half_bbox_dim`, calculate the max x/y center coordinates for this angle.
           
           I'm calculating `x_coords` and `y_coords` as evenly spaced points within that max range, ensuring I'm generating a comprehensive placement spread.  I'll start with five key angles (0, pi/4, pi/2, 3*pi/4, pi) for diversity.
           For 50 placements, I will select five key angles.
           
           For the angles where the object aligns with the axes I'll take a 5x5 grid. For the angle pi/4 I'll take a 3x3 grid, for a more central spread and 1 placement at the origin.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement for Object ID 4, Avoiding Collision with Object ID 5**
           
           Alright, I've got a successful placement for Object 5, located at `(-0.0956, -0.0956)`, and now I need to place Object 4 without any collisions. Object 4 is essentially a square, roughly 0.097 units on each side.  Object 5 is smaller, about 0.079 units.  Surface 0 is defined by the corners `(-0.135, -0.135)` and `(0.135, 0.135)`. I've already determined the AABB of Object 5, which extends from `-0.135` to `-0.0563` in both x and y, and I've also calculated the half-dimensions and AABB sizes.
           
           The core of the problem is collision detection.  I need to ensure no overlap between Object 4's AABB and Object 5's AABB.  I'm going to generate a list of 50 possible placements for Object 4. To begin, I need to consider various possible rotations (theta) and center positions (x,y) to ensure diverse placements.
           
           Since I have confirmed the placement of Object 5 is on the surface and centered in the bottom-left corner of the surface with coordinates `(-0.0956, -0.0956)` and at `theta=0`.  With the established surface and placement for Object 5 I have decided that to avoid collisions I must have Object 4 be centered to the right or above Object 5, within the allowable surface space.
           
           So, I'm setting a grid and a threshold. Based on the size of the objects and the surface, valid placements are when the AABB lower bound is greater or equal to `-0.0078`, to ensure Object 4 does not collide with Object 5.
           
           I've crafted a plan. I will calculate possible placements, in the bounds of the surface, with rotations of 0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2, and pi/4, and using the calculated AABB. Then I will calculate the points to ensure each AABB is valid for each combination. And finally, I've organized the valid placements.
           
           The first strategy generates an x and y coordinate grid for the coordinates using angles of `0`, and then, since 21 placements were calculated for the angles of `0`, I have adjusted the placements to have only 8 placements to ensure a total of 50 placements when combined with the results for angles of `pi/2`, `pi`, and `3pi/2`. Finally, I was able to generate valid placements for the 50 possible positions!

(Thoughts: **Scene Analysis and Potential Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a square surface (0.135 x 0.135) and two existing, stable objects already placed: Object 5 and Object 4.  My task is to determine feasible positions for a new square object (Object 7) of a specific size (0.098855 x 0.098855), ensuring it doesn't collide with the existing ones.
           
           I've calculated the bounding box extents for the new object based on possible rotations (0, pi/4, pi/2, etc.).  The bounding box size changes with rotation.  For rotations of multiples of pi/2, the bounding box half-width (h_bbox) equals half the object's side length (0.049). However, for rotations of pi/4 plus multiples, the bounding box's h_bbox is a bit larger because of the diagonal (about 0.07).  This also dictates the maximum allowed center coordinate of the new object on each axis (x and y).
           
           My strategy is to generate a grid of potential (x, y) coordinates for Object 7, for each possible rotation. The grid resolution needs to be fine enough to ensure all possible valid placements are accounted for. I will also make sure all generated AABB placements remain within the valid surface range. This range is determined by the size and rotation of the new object (Object 7) relative to the surface boundaries.
           
           I've considered that the most collision prone area is where the already placed objects (Object 4 and Object 5) are, so the best placements are far from that region.
           
           I now have a refined approach for checking collisions. I'll use a collision detection function to make sure that the object does not overlap with existing objects. If no collision, then this placement is added to the list. I have also refined the grid of generated positions to avoid known problem zones. If the object's bounding box is fully contained within the surface, and if it's not colliding, I'll record that placement. I'll pick the first 50 valid placements.
