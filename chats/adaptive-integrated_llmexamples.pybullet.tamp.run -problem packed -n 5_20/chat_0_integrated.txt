           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v20)
               Atom on(v12, v20)
               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is to place objects v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18 on object v20. Looking at the initial state, all of these objects are currently supported by object v11. Object v20 is a surface that has a bounding box, meaning it is a valid place for these objects.
           
           The initial state also shows that there are no pick or place action instances provided for any of the objects, only a move_base action instance that effectively moves the base from v3 to v3 (meaning no actual movement happens). This indicates that the robot is either not in a position to pick or place objects or that the `kin`, `atraj`, or `cfreeposepose`, `cfreeapproachpose`, `cfreetrajpose` and `cfreetrajgrasppose` predicates are not satisfied, or that the system could not find valid continuous parameters for them. Given that no pick or place actions are available, it is impossible to move any object. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
