(Thoughts: **Analysis and Proposed Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, here's the situation. I'm tasked with finding three suitable base positions for a robot to "view" a target point. The catch? The given target point, `-0.02677, 1.09689`, appears to be *inside* the central vertical wall, represented by obstacle 5, `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`. In a standard scenario, this would mean the target is essentially occluded by the wall. However, the instructions are clear: *never* give up, and I must provide positions. Therefore, I must make an informed assumption about how "view" and line-of-sight are interpreted in this specific context.
           
           My assumption is this: the system will somehow account for a target point being *within* an obstacle. Perhaps the "target" is a point *on* the surface of the wall, or that there's a different LOS handling within that wall.  If this assumption is false, there is *no* solution, and these positions will be invalid.
           
           Based on this, I've devised the following strategy: place the robot base *outside* obstacle 5 (and other obstacles), within the `max_range` of 2 units from the target, and aiming for diverse perspectives. I will not put the robot in the *same* fixed obstacle.
           
           Here are my proposed base positions:
           
           1.  **Left of the wall:** `(-0.5, 1.5)`. This position is outside the wall, above the target, offering a view from the left.
           2.  **Right of the wall:** `(0.5, 1.5)`. This is another position outside the wall, also slightly above the target, offering a view from the right.
           3.  **Below the target (left side of the wall):** `(-0.1, 0.5)`. This is on the lower side of the target.
           All these positions are within the permissible space (`[-2.5, 2.5]`, `[-2.5, 2.5]`), are not inside any AABB obstacle, and are within the radius of 2 from the target. The robot's orientation `theta` to the target is set by the system itself.
           
           Let me emphasize: it's critical to acknowledge that the target point falling *inside* a fixed obstacle is a significant, unusual constraint. This is the only valid solution under the given instructions and data, assuming a special handling is in place for line of sight in this scenario.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Analyzing Target and Obstacle Geometry for Robot Positioning**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new target point, `(0.00762, 0.44917)`, and the first thing that jumps out is that it's *inside* the central vertical obstacle (obstacle 5), which spans `x \in [-0.05, 0.05]`. This is unusual. I need to keep in mind the problem statement's instruction to handle each target request independently, and to interpret previous failures cautiously. The prior failure related to a very different target at (1.833, 2.183), with the failure caused by the central vertical obstacle.
           
           Given the target's location, line-of-sight is almost certainly blocked from outside the obstacle. My immediate thought is to consider a position *immediately* adjacent to the obstacle, on either side. Since the robot itself must not collide with fixed obstacles, I cannot propose a position within obstacle 5's boundaries. It makes the most sense to propose positions *outside* of obstacle 5's borders, and therefore immediately adjacent.
           
           The target distance must be `<= 2`.
           
           I'll propose a few positions to increase the probability that at least one works:
           
           *   **Position 1:**  `(-0.06, 0.449)`. This is just to the left of the obstacle. The distance to the target is only about 0.0676. I have also verified that this position doesn't collide with any other obstacles.
           *   **Position 2:**  `(0.06, 0.449)`. The idea here is to go just to the right of the obstacle. The distance to the target is approximately 0.0524. Again, it does not collide with the others.
           *   **Position 3:**  `(-0.06, 0.6)`. Just to the left, but I have increased the y coordinate, to provide diversity. This yields a target distance of approximately 0.165. No other obstacles collide.
           
           These positions are all within the bounds, at a distance of `<=2` and no other fixed obstacle collisions. Since the target is inside a fixed obstacle, this is my preferred approach to providing visibility.

(Thoughts: **Navigating the Central Wall Conundrum**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. We're given a target point, *again*, inside that pesky central wall. My goal is to find valid positions for our robot.
           
           First, I re-evaluated the target, which is the same as the initial target: `(-0.02677, 1.09689)`. This confirmed it's inside the central vertical wall (obstacle 5). So the problem remains the same.
           
           Now, let's sift through the feedback, remembering the confusing history. The collision feedback is, well, confusing. It claims that obstacle 0 is the central wall, which contradicts the original setup. This is a critical inconsistency! I'm assuming, for now, that the feedback is *correct* about *which geometry* it's flagging as the collision point, even if the index (0 vs 5) is wrong. This suggests a safety margin (e.g., a robot radius) around the robot, since positions like `(-0.06, ...) ` and `(0.06, ...)` were reported as colliding with what it (the feedback system) is defining as obstacle 0 (which I believe is obstacle 5, the central wall). This safety margin implies the robot's coordinates must be some distance away from the actual AABB wall boundaries to avoid collisions.
           
           The feedback about "no line of sight" from previous requests is a separate issue with targets outside of this wall, so it's irrelevant to this problem of getting around *inside* the central wall.
           
           Given the target inside the wall, I'm adapting my approach. To avoid collisions, and keeping the robot base far enough away, I propose these three positions: `(-0.1, 1.09689)`, `(0.1, 1.09689)`, and `(-0.1, 1.2)`. These locations should place the robot sufficiently outside the safety margin around the central wall. Plus, they should maintain a good line of sight given that these proposed points are very close to the wall's coordinates.
           
           Let's hope these positions work this time!
