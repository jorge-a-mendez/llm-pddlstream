           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to satisfy this new axiom `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to getting images of two objectives and then analyzing all the rocks, both soil and stone. My first step is to break down the axiom and see what needs to be true in the final state.  I've got the initial state, which gives me a jump-start on a few conditions, but the key ones I need to achieve are those `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           
           Now, I analyze the objects, rocks, and the rovers' initial configurations. I’ve noticed the presence of `#o` which are placeholders for continuous parameters.  The crucial part is the constraint about continuous values: I need to assign these `#o` placeholders with specific values to make the imagevisible/comvisible relationships true. The problem says that the #o values for the *same* predicates in the *initial state* should be treated as unique parameters -  meaning that even though initial state contains something like `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, I must assume that the #o3 and #o4 values are unique for *each* (rover, target) pair.
           
           Given my analysis, I figured that `v14` (the rover at `v15`) will handle all image-related tasks, as it is closer to the lander and can communicate better with it. Rover `v12` is closer to the rocks, so it will handle the rock sampling.  
           
           Now, I was ready to create the plan: `v14` taking images of objectives, `v12` analyzing rocks, and then both rovers sending data to the lander. I thought I had a solid plan to achieve the goal.
           
           However, here's where things get tricky. The problem statement includes a critical caveat: a very limited *list of valid action instances*.  I am only allowed to use `move` actions which do nothing in the current config (rovers stay in the starting positions) and `drop_rock`. No `take_image`, no `send_image`, no `sample_rock`, no `send_analysis`.  This means the images and rock analysis predicates will never be true. This led me to the conclusion that with the extremely restricted list of actions, the goal is simply **unreachable**.
