           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v20)
               Atom on(v12, v20)
               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve a state where objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` are all *on* object `v20`.  The definition of 'on' hinges on two conditions:  an object must be *supported* by another object at a specific *pose*, and it must actually *be* at that pose (i.e., *atpose*).
           
           My initial inspection reveals that these goal objects currently reside *on* `v11`, supported at poses like `v9`, `v13`, etc.  The problem provides *supported* facts showing that each goal object *could* be on `v20` (specifically at the hypothetical pose `#o2`).  The snag is that none of the objects are currently *atpose(#o2)*.
           
           To get the objects *on* `v20`, I'd need to use `place` actions, which are dependent on *pick* actions to function.  I need to pick each object from its initial pose, and then place it on `#o2`.
           
           However, the action instance I'm given is only *move_base*, from `v3` to `v3`. This is effectively a no-op! It means the robot can't move its base, which would be necessary to maneuver to the positions required to pick, and then place. I can't even get the robot to a place where it can make use of `pick` or `place` if they were available.
           
           The constraint explicitly states that any action not included in the provided list is forbidden.  Since *pick* and *place* are required for manipulation of the objects and *move_base* is useless, the goal is unachievable given the available actions. I am constrained to the given moves and cannot use the needed actions. The facts do exist to support `on(v8,v20)` and similar but lack of pick and place actions means that I cannot make use of those facts.
