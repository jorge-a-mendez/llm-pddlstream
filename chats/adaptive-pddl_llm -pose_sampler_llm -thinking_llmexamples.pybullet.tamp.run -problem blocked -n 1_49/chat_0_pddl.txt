           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 10) -- 0.09053506844846027, 0.09053506844846027)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object 10 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for this square object (object 10) on surface 0. The object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) dimensions are  `size_x = size_y = 0.09053506844846027`. The surface 0 is defined by the points `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.
           
           First, I need to interpret `size_x` and `size_y`. Based on the wording, I'm assuming that these are *always* the dimensions of the object's AABB, no matter its rotation. This is the simplest interpretation and aligns with the phrase "axis-aligned". If this leads to problems later, I can revisit this assumption, but for now, the rotation angle `theta` only changes the visual aspect, not the collision geometry.
           
           With this assumption, the valid region for the object's center `(x, y)` on the surface is calculated based on the surface bounds and the object's size. I will then ensure that the object's AABB is fully contained within the surface boundaries.
           
           I've determined the valid ranges for `x` and `y` and will sample these uniformly to generate 50 unique placements. I will generate a 10x5 grid of `x` and `y` coordinates for the object's center, evenly spaced within the surface's valid area. I will also vary the rotation angle `theta` for each placement by incrementing `theta` from `0` to `2 * pi` in 50 equal steps. This should give me diverse placements. Since it is a first placement, I assume there are no other obstacles to account for.
           
           The result is a list of 50 tuples, each containing `(0, theta, x, y)`, representing the surface index, rotation angle, and the center coordinates of object 10.
