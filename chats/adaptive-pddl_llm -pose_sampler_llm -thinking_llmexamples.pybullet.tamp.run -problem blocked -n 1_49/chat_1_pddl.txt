           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to achieving both `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.  I quickly realize that `?green` needs to be bound to `v12` since `type(v12, v17)` is already true, making the real challenge `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           To achieve `on(v12, v18)`, I need to find a pose `?p` where both `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)` are true.  From the initial state, I see that `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` is true. So, if I can get `atpose(v12, #o2)` to be true, I've got it. Currently, `atpose(v12, v13)` is true.  This means I need to move object `v12` from pose `v13` to pose `#o2`.
           
           My usual tool for moving objects is to `pick` it up from one place and `place` it down somewhere else. I check for available actions and the `pick` action seems appropriate. Looking at the preconditions for `pick`, I see that the robot's kinematics are correctly set up via the `kin` fact, and `handempty` is also satisfied. However, there's a problem: the `pick` action requires `atbconf(#o3)` to be true. Now I see that the robot is currently at `atbconf(v3)`, and the `move_base` action available keeps the robot at `v3`.
           
           Here's the sticking point:  All the `kin` facts related to `pick` and `place` seem to *require* the robot to be at base configuration `#o3`.  But there's no way to *get* to base configuration `#o3`! The only `move_base` action simply leaves the robot at base configuration `v3`. I need `atbconf(#o3)` but only have `atbconf(v3)` and `move_base v3 v3`.
           
           I could try assuming that `#o3` and `v3` are the same, but PDDL usually uses distinct symbols for distinct objects. I'll stick with that convention for now. The robot needs to be at `#o3`, according to all the `kin` predicates, but it *starts* and remains at `v3`.  This is a critical mismatch.
           
           Since I can't get the robot to the required base configuration `#o3` (which is needed for any action that manipulates objects), I can't perform the `pick` action.  Without `pick`, I can't move object `v12` to `#o2`. Without `atpose(v12, #o2)`, I can't achieve `on(v12, v18)`. Therefore, the overall goal `new-axiom@0()` is *unachievable* from the given initial state.  I can't devise a plan because no plan exists.
