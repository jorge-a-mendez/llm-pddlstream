           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning Through the Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object, let's call it `?green`, "on" `v18` and of "type" `v17`. Looking at the initial state, I see two objects that satisfy the type requirement: `v8` and `v12`. Either could work, but I'll focus on `v12` for now.
           
           To get `v12` "on" `v18`, I need to find a pose, `?p`, where `v12` is supported by `v18` (`supported(v12, ?p, v18)`) and `v12` is actually at that pose (`atpose(v12, ?p)`).  Luckily, the initial state has a continuous parameter, `#o2`, which, combined with `v18`, satisfies the supported relation for both `v8` and `v12`. So, if I get `v12` to `#o2`, I'm golden.
           
           Currently, `v12` is at `v13`. So the plan boils down to moving `v12` from `v13` to `#o2`. This screams "pick and place." The initial state gives me a robot arm, `v4`, that's currently "handempty" and at a certain configuration.
           
           Now, I need to check if a pick action can be applied to `v12`. I see a suitable action: `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4`. The main hurdle is the `atbconf(#o3)` precondition on the `pick` action.  Currently, the base robot's configuration is at `v3` (`atbconf(v3)`), but I'm given the action `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` which seems to get me where I need to be.
           
           I'll execute this action and keep in mind that the state variable `canmove()` controls base motion. The `move_base` action will set `atbconf(#o3)` to True, but will also make `canmove()` false. The `pick` action, if it can execute, has `canmove()` as an effect. The pick will not have `canmove()` as a precondition because that would block the plan from executing. However, the action has an implicit canmove as an action. This is the correct behaviour.
           
           So, here's the plan: First, I use `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` to move the base. Then, I use the `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4` action. Now, `v12` is in the robot's gripper.
           
           Next, I look for the `place` action. I see `place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`. It looks good, and with the `pick` executed previously, all preconditions are satisfied. I execute the action, and `v12` ends up at the correct position `#o2`.
           
           With `v12` now on `v18` and the `type` constraint met, the `new-axiom@0()` goal is finally satisfied. This completes the plan.
