           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning:**
           
           I'm faced with a planning problem using PDDL. My goal is to get several objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`) onto a specific surface (`v18`). The initial state shows these objects are currently on `v11`.  To achieve the goal, I need to manipulate these objects, likely using `pick` and `place` actions. The problem defines "valid action instances" I can use in a plan.
           
           I carefully analyzed the initial state, the goal state, and the PDDL actions. I noted the continuous parameters denoted by `#o0`, `#o1`, and `#o2`. These represent poses, grasps, and trajectories that need to be instantiated for any `pick` or `place` to work.
           
           However, the crucial point is the limited list of *valid* action instances. The only action instance provided is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This action moves the base, but since the starting and ending configurations are identical, it either has a dubious effect on the `atbconf` predicate (potentially setting and negating it at the same time, leading to contradiction), or has no real effect, other than consuming `canmove()`.
           
           The instructions state, "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." This means I am constrained to only using that one `move_base` action. Given that `pick` and `place` actions are required to move objects from `v11` to `v18`, and no `pick` or `place` instances are available, the goal is *unreachable*.
           
           It's tempting to think this is a simplification or I'm missing an instruction, but the problem's phrasing and the explicit list of allowed action instances are clear. I must conclude that the robot cannot manipulate the objects because it only has access to a non-functional base motion action.
