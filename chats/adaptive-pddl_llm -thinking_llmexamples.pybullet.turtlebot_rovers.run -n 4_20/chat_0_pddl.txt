           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of Achieving `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with the goal `new-axiom@0()`, and I need a plan to achieve it given my current initial state. First things first, I break down the goal definition. It's a conjunction of several atomic facts: `atconf`, `free`, `receivedimage`, and `receivedanalysis`, along with some type relationships.
           
           Straight away, I check my current situation against the `atconf` and `free` conditions.  The initial state already satisfies those, so no problem there. That leaves `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` as the crucial ones to achieve. I need four instances of `receivedimage` and at least one object each of type 'stone' and 'soil' to have `receivedanalysis`.
           
           Now, I look at my available actions: `move` and `drop_rock`.  I go through the `move` actions – `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`.  But honestly, these moves don't actually *do* anything useful!  They simply move the rovers to the *same* location they are already at. They clearly don't help with the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           
           Then I examine `drop_rock`.  However, in my initial state, both `v12` and `v14` are free, not full. So, the precondition for `drop_rock`, `full`, is not met. It's not applicable.
           
           Here's the problem: The only actions I'm allowed to use are those two moves and the drop_rock action. But those actions are completely insufficient! To get `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` I would need image and analysis actions that aren't in my action list. It's impossible to make any progress towards those goals with the constraints I've been given.
           
           Therefore, given the strict rule that I can't use *any* action not on the allowed list, and the fact that the allowed actions don't get me anywhere close to the goal, I have to conclude that **this goal is unreachable with the actions provided.**
