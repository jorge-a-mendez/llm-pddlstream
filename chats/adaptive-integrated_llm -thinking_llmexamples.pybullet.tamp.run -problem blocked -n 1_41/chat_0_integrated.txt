User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.341, 0.301), (-4.251, 0.39)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.296, 0.346, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.576, 0.818).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom graspable(v15)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom type(v12, v17)
           Atom stackable(v15, v10)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v14)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom pose(v15, v16)
           Atom stackable(v12, v18)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom type(v8, v17)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom stackable(v8, v18)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Analysis and Unreachability**
           
           Okay, here's the situation. I need a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which boils down to ensuring `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. The initial state tells me `v12` and `v8` are of the right type.  So, I need either `on(v12, v18)` or `on(v8, v18)`.
           
           To achieve `on(?o, ?r)`, I need both `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`.  I see `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` in the initial state.  That means I need `atpose(v12, #o2)` OR `atpose(v8, #o2)`.
           
           However, my available actions are extremely limited. The *only* action I can use is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This implies I *cannot* use actions like `pick` or `place`.  And that's the problem.
           
           To get `atpose(v12, #o2)` or `atpose(v8, #o2)`, I *must* manipulate objects, effectively 'picking' and 'placing' them. Since these actions are not available, it's impossible to satisfy the `on(?green, v18)` condition.  Therefore, I cannot achieve the goal. No plan exists to solve this problem with the actions provided.
