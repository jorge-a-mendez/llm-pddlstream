User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object

           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object

           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.341, 0.301), (-4.251, 0.39)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.296, 0.346, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.576, 0.818).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My objective is to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which requires establishing `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.  I've analyzed the initial state and identified that `?green` can be either `v8` or `v12`, both of which have the required `type`.  Since `on(?green, v18)` can be broken down into `supported(?green, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(?green, ?p)`, and given that both `v8` and `v12` are supported on a specific pose `#o2` on `v18`, I need to move one of these objects to that pose.
           
           I chose to focus on `v8` since it seems closer to the robot's default base position and, importantly, there are appropriate kinematic facts to describe the pick-and-place operation from the same starting base configuration. The plan involves the following steps:
           
           1.  **`pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`:**  This action will pick up `v8` from its initial pose `v9`. The preconditions include valid kinematics (which I assume the problem has provided via the `kin` facts and will be satisfied for the base config `v3`), `atpose(v8, v9)`, and the robot's gripper being empty.  Assuming the robot arm (v4) will be able to reach from the base `v3`, the plan is feasible.  The `kin` facts indicate that the gripper's base config is `v3` and the objects are movable from this default configuration, as the `move_base` action available moves the base from and to itself, indicating there are no base position changes.
           2.  **`place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`:**  The second step places `v8` at pose `#o2` on surface `v18`.  The same assumptions about kinematics and the appropriate base configuration apply.  The key is to verify that `#o2` is a valid pose for placing `v8`.  The problem states, "pose(obj, #<name>)" is in the initial state for some `obj`, then a continuous value for the pose such that, given the geometry of the scene, the pose is a collision-free stable placement for the object on a surface for which `supported(obj, #<name>, surf)` is in the initial state. The placement must be stable. Since `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is in the initial state, I'll provide an `#o2` that satisfies the above. I will also make assumptions about the surface and provide appropriate Z.
           
           For the continuous parameter `#o2`, I decided on (4.5, -0.3, 0.8), which places the object at the center of the surface `v18`. I confirmed that the object's dimensions fit within the surface's bounding box to ensure a stable placement. The object's z-coordinate is the surface z value + its object height or, more specifically, a value for the z that the object will rest on a surface.
           
           By executing these two actions, `v8` will be at the correct pose on surface `v18`, and `on(v8, v18)` will hold. Combined with the initial state fact `type(v8, v17)`, this will satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`. Given the constraints, the costs are minimal as `move_base` actions will have no effect on `atbconf`, so they are not necessary.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Unachievable Goal Due to Action Restrictions**
           
           Okay, so the user pointed out a critical flaw in the previous plan: I was using `pick` and `place` actions, which are *not* permitted.  The only allowed action is the rather useless `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This boils down to a no-op, basically just consuming a "canmove" predicate.
           
           The goal is to achieve `on(?green, v18)`. This means either `on(v12, v18)` or `on(v8, v18)` must be true.  To make this true, the following conditions must be met:
           
           *   For `v12`: `atpose(v12, ?p)` AND `supported(v12, ?p, v18)`
           *   For `v8`: `atpose(v8, ?p)` AND `supported(v8, ?p, v18)`
           
           Looking at the initial state, I can see that `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` are already true.  This means if `v12` were *at* pose `#o2`, or if `v8` were *at* pose `#o2`, then the goal would be satisfied.  But, neither `v12` nor `v8` are initially at `#o2`:
           
           *   `v12` is at `v13`
           *   `v8` is at `v9`
           
           The key constraint here is the *lack* of `pick` and `place` actions.  Since I can't move these objects, the `atpose` predicates remain fixed as they are in the initial state.  The allowed `move_base` action doesn't affect `atpose` predicates; it's a null operation.
           
           Therefore, because I can't manipulate the objects, and given the initial configurations, the goal `on(?green, v18)` is *unachievable* within the constraints.  The existing `on` predicates based on the initial state cannot be rearranged with the given action. The robot is stuck.
