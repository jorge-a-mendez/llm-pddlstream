(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation for a Square Object**
           
           Okay, so I need to generate 50 stable placements for a square object (size 0.07 x 0.07) on a defined surface (Surface 0, defined by points (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0)).  A stable placement means the object must be entirely within the surface's boundaries.  The object's position is defined by `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`, where `surf_idx` is the surface index, `theta` is the rotation angle, and `(x, y)` are the object's center coordinates.  Since the object is square, the rotation `theta` doesn't change the object's effective bounding box dimensions. Therefore, I can consistently use `theta = 0` (or `pi/2`) for simplicity.
           
           My calculations focus on determining the valid range for `x` and `y` coordinates to ensure the object is fully contained within the surface.  The object's half-extents are `hx = hy = 0.035`. For Surface 0, the constraints are: `4.235 <= x <= 4.765` and `-0.565 <= y <= -0.035`.
           
           To generate a diverse set of 50 placements, I'll create a grid within these `x` and `y` ranges.  I'll use 8 evenly spaced `x` values and 7 evenly spaced `y` values. This gives me 56 placements (8 * 7). This will give me `(0, 0, x_0, y_0)` up to `(0, 0, x_6, y_6)` (49 placements), and then `(0, 0, x_7, y_0)`.
           
           To find the steps for `x` and `y`, I'll divide the range by the number of points.
           `x_step = 0.53 / 7` and `y_step = 0.53 / 6`. I'll calculate these steps and generate the exact coordinates. I will generate these coordinates to avoid any rounding errors, using the above ranges and steps.
           
           My plan is to generate all `x` and `y` combinations within the valid ranges and select the first 50. Since `theta = 0` won't influence the placement, I'll use it for all.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Placing Object 10 and Avoiding Collisions**
           
           Alright, the feedback confirms the successful placement of object 5 at (4.235, -0.565). My next task is to position object 10 on the same surface, Surface 0. Object 10 is slightly larger than object 5, measuring approximately 0.0712 x 0.0712, making its half-extents around 0.0356.
           
           Surface 0 has the bounds: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  Therefore, the valid center coordinates for object 10 on Surface 0 have been calculated.  I need to stay within the allowable x and y ranges.
           
           Crucially, I need to prevent object 10 from colliding with the already-placed object 5. Object 5 occupies an area from [4.2, 4.27] x [-0.6, -0.53]. Using AABB collision detection, I'll need to make sure that object 10 stays outside this area.  Since both objects are squares, theta = 0 is optimal to keep my calculations simple.
           
           The valid ranges for object 10's center are now constrained by its need to avoid object 5. The x-range that avoids object 5 starts at 4.3056... and the y-range to avoid object 5 starts at -0.4943...
           
           To ensure stability and diversity, I’m planning to generate 50 potential placements for object 10. To achieve this, I will implement a grid strategy, essentially creating 7 horizontal and 8 vertical points within the available space.  I have precise calculations using the object’s extents and the surface bounds.  The x-range is now [4.3056... , 4.7643...] and y-range is [-0.5643... , -0.0356...].  The detailed ranges have also been re-confirmed.  I'm ready to populate the final list of potential placements based on these calculations.
