(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation Strategy for Square Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to generate 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5, dimensions 0.0987 x 0.0987) on a square surface (0.27 x 0.27) centered at (0,0). For a placement to be stable, the object's bounding box must be fully contained within the surface's bounding box. Given that this is a first-time placement request, I only need to consider self-collisions within the surface.
           
           Knowing the square shape, I recognize that rotating the object by multiples of 90 degrees results in the same effective bounding box. However, rotations by 45 degrees result in a larger, and thus more restrictive, bounding box. To maximize placement opportunities, I will focus primarily on rotations of 0 and 90 degrees, which share the same limits of movement for the object's center point.
           
           **Here's my plan:**
           
           1.  **Define Limits:** First, I'll calculate the valid range for the object's center coordinates (x, y) when rotated by 0 degrees. With the object's half-size as `half_s = 0.049361`, this range is approximately [-0.0856, 0.0856] for both x and y.
           
           2.  **Generate Grid:** I will create a 5x5 grid of (x, y) coordinates within this range, ensuring a good coverage of the available surface area.
               *   `x_coords = [-0.0856, -0.0428, 0.0, 0.0428, 0.0856]`
               *   `y_coords = [-0.0856, -0.0428, 0.0, 0.0428, 0.0856]`
               
           3.  **Placement Creation:** Using this grid, I will create placements as:
               *   For the first 25 placements, I'll use the coordinates generated (x, y) with a rotation angle of 0. Resulting in placements such as (0, 0, x, y).
               *   For the next 25 placements, I will use the same coordinates, but this time with a rotation angle of pi/2 (90 degrees). Resulting in placements such as (0, pi/2, x, y)
               
           This grid-based method ensures the required quantity of 50 stable placements while maximizing the area coverage within the surface. Using two common rotations helps ensure the placements are relatively uniformly distributed.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Object Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've successfully placed Object 5, and now I need to place Object 4 on the same surface, avoiding any collisions with Object 5. Since I'm working in a 2D environment, I'll use the bounding box calculations extensively to ensure stability.
           
           First, I've got the surface boundaries: (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). Object 4 is almost square with dimensions 0.07922021376001548 x 0.07922021376001553, so I'll approximate its side length as 0.07922021376001553 (s).  The AABB is key for stable placement.
           
           My initial approach is to define a "valid" region for Object 4's center, where it's stable within the surface bounds.  For Object 4 with its center at (x, y), this means a range of [-0.095, 0.095] for both x and y.  Then, I need to account for Object 5, currently placed in the bottom-left corner and occupying an area (-0.135, -0.135) to (-0.03627780503218826, -0.03627780503218826). The collision check between the two objects must be performed with bounding box comparisons.
           
           To avoid collision, the center point must NOT be:
           1.  to the left of the bounding box of Object 5 (impossible in valid range)
           2.  to the right of the bounding box of Object 5, meaning `x >=  0.00333...`
           3.  below the bounding box of Object 5 (impossible in valid range)
           4.  above the bounding box of Object 5, meaning `y >= 0.00333...`
           
           Effectively, I've defined a forbidden bottom-left region. Any stable position would need to be outside this region.
           
           I'll generate a grid of potential center points to satisfy the constraints, testing both with Object 4 in its initial orientation (theta = 0) as well as its rotated state (theta = pi/2).
           
           Here's how I'll do this to be certain that all checks are performed correctly:
           *   Define a grid of points within the valid center region and perform the bounding box collision test.
           *   In the case of Object 4 rotated by 0° , any center points (x,y) where x >= 0.00333... OR y >= 0.00333... are valid. This excludes the bottom-left.
           *   In the case of Object 4 rotated by 90° , the same calculation with the sides swapped.
           *   Finally, filter the grid of valid center points for collisions, and then take the first 50 stable placements. I will start testing on the unrotated, but I should add the pi/2 points in to make 50 unique placements total.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm dealing with. I need to place a new square object (ID 6) on a surface (Surface 0) and find 50 stable, non-colliding locations. The catch? Two other objects (IDs 4 and 5) are already on the surface and I *must* avoid any overlap with them. I'm provided with the exact dimensions and positions of the existing objects, as well as the dimensions of the new object. My intuition is to:
           
           1.  **Define the Surface Boundaries:** First, I'll figure out the usable space on the surface. Simple, it's a rectangle with the size given.
           
           2.  **Calculate Safe Zones:** Given the object is square and I can rotate it, its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box, which is the smallest rectangle that completely encloses it) stays the same for rotations of 0, pi/2, pi, and 3pi/2. It's safe to start with those rotations. I'll need to account for the object's dimensions to determine where its center can safely be located without going outside the surface.
           
           3.  **Generate Candidate Placements:** I'll set up a grid of potential (x, y) center positions within this safe zone. A reasonable grid density is needed. I'm going with a 7x7 grid to start.
           
           4.  **Collision Detection:** For each grid point, I'll calculate the exact AABB for the new object and compare it with the AABBs of the existing objects. A simple AABB-AABB collision check will be used.
           
           5.  **Filtering & Optimization:** If there are no collisions, I'll keep the placement (surface index, rotation angle, x-coordinate, y-coordinate) and repeat. Once I have 50 non-colliding placements, I can stop.
           
           **Collision Detection Logic**
           
           For collision detection, I'll use the AABB intersection test. Two rectangles don't overlap if one's maximum x is less than the other's minimum x, or if one's maximum y is less than the other's minimum y. I will return `True` when boxes *do* collide.
           
           **The Strategy Implementation**
           
           I'm structuring the code in a way that is easy to understand and debug. I'll test each of the four cardinal rotations.
           The collision logic is checked via nested loops for all valid coordinate points using a 7x7 grid. The script should quickly find the safe zones on the surface for object 6!
