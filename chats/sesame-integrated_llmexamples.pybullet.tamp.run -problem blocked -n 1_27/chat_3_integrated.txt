           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).

           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.554, 0.238, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.037, 0.999).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).

           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.
           
           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q0', '#t1'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q0', '#q1', '#t3'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', '#p0', '#g0', '#q1', '#t2'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-traj-pose:('#t0', 'v15', 'v16')->()`, which impeded executing the action pick('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0').
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions. If the failure occurs after placing on any pose that does not start with '#', it may be due to using a combination of invalid poses.As the expert, you may decide to choose additional poses, providing their continuous values using any free pose starting with '#'. 

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` is satisfied if there is an object on v18 and that object has type v17.
           Currently, `v8` is at `v9` and `v15` is at `v16`, both supported by `v11`. `v12` is at `v13` supported by `v14`. All these objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v15`) are of type `v17`. The surface `v18` is available and has bounding box `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. `v8` and `v15` are on `v11` which is a wider surface compared to `v18`. Since `v18` has a miny of -0.6 and maxy of 0.0, it is the bottom half of `v11`. This suggests that `v8` or `v15` are blocking `v18`. The previous attempt failed because the pick action on `v8` at `v9` collided with `v15` at `v16`. Since `v8` and `v15` are close to each other, picking `v8` might cause a collision.
           
           To achieve the goal, we need to pick an object of type `v17` and place it on `v18`. `v12` is on `v14` (on the left side of the robot) and `v8`, `v15` are on `v11` (on the right side of the robot). `v18` is on the right side. It is best to choose an object on the right side of the robot.
           Let's try to pick `v15` from `v16` and place it on `v18`. Since `v15` is smaller (`((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335))`) and `v18` is `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`, `v15` can be placed on `v18`.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Fact is not satisfied: Atom new-axiom@0()`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` is satisfied if there is an object of type `v17` on surface `v18`.
           In the initial state, `v8`, `v12`, and `v15` are all of type `v17`. `v8` is at `v9` on `v11`, `v12` is at `v13` on `v14`, and `v15` is at `v16` on `v11`. `v18` is a surface on which we can place an object.
           
           The previous plan failed because the goal `new-axiom@0()` was not satisfied. This means that after placing `v15` on `#o2` (which is on `v18`), the system still did not detect `on(v15, v18)`. This implies that the pose `#o2` was not correctly linked to the `supported` predicate or the `on` axiom wasn't satisfied.
           Let's analyze the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom has two definitions in the domain:
           1. `new-axiom@0(?o: object)`: `NegatedAtom =(?culprit, ?o)` and `Atom graspable(?culprit)`. This axiom implies that there exists at least one graspable object. This is true from the initial state, as `v8`, `v12`, `v15` are all graspable. This cannot be the goal.
           2. `new-axiom@0()`: `Atom on(?green, v18)` and `Atom type(?green, v17)`. This is the correct goal to satisfy. So, we need to place an object of type `v17` on `v18`.
           
           My previous placement of `v15` on `#o2` (supported by `v18`) should have satisfied `on(v15, v18)` and `type(v15, v17)`. The error message indicated `Fact is not satisfied: Atom new-axiom@0()`. This is confusing, as it doesn't specify *which* `new-axiom@0()` (the one with an argument or the one without). Assuming it's the latter, the `on` predicate was not satisfied.
           
           Let's re-examine the `supported` facts:
           `supported(v8, v9, v11)`
           `supported(v12, v13, v14)`
           `supported(v15, v16, v11)`
           `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`
           `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`
           `supported(v15, #o2, v10)` (This is a problem: `v10` is not a surface in the scene description, so placing `v15` at `#o2` supported by `v10` will not result in it being on `v18`.)
           `supported(v12, #o2, v10)` (Same problem)
           `supported(v8, #o2, v10)` (Same problem)
           
           The only `supported` facts that link `#o2` to `v18` are `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. This means we *must* place `v8` or `v12` on `#o2` for the `on(?object, v18)` predicate to be true.
           
           Let's pick `v8` and place it on `#o2`, ensuring `#o2` is supported by `v18`.
           `v8` is at `v9` on `v11`. `v15` is at `v16` on `v11`. They are close to each other.
           The prior plan failed with `test-cfree-traj-pose:('#t0', 'v15', 'v16')->()`, indicating that picking `v8` from `v9` (with trajectory `#t0`) collided with `v15` at `v16`.
           
           This means that `v15` is blocking the approach for `v8`. The problem is that both `v8` and `v15` are on `v11`, and `v9` and `v16` are close.
           Let's choose `v12` instead. `v12` is at `v13` on `v14`. This is on the other side of the table from `v11`, so it won't have collision issues with `v8` or `v15`.
           We need to use `kin(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)` to pick, and `kin(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` to place.
           The base configurations `v3` and `#o3` and trajectory `#o0` are given.
           
           Plan:
           1. Pick `v12` from `v13` using arm `v4`, grasp `#o1`, base conf `#o3`, and trajectory `#o4`.
           2. Place `v12` on `#o2` supported by `v18` using arm `v4`, grasp `#o1`, base conf `#o3`, and trajectory `#o4`.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', #o3) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which means placing an object of `type v17` on `v18`.
           From the initial state, `atbconf(v3)` is true. The `pick` action requires `atbconf(#o3)`. We need to move the base from `v3` to `#o3` before picking.
           
           The available `move_base` actions are:
           `((move_base #o3 #o3 #o0))`
           `((move_base #o3 v3 #o0))`
           `((move_base v3 #o3 #o0))`
           `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`
           
           So we need to execute `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)` first. Then we can proceed with picking and placing `v12`.
