           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains several objects, some of which are graspable and stackable. There are two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both starting handempty. The robot's base is at configuration `v3`. The goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom representing `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. Looking at the initial state, we have `type(v12, v17)`, so `v12` is likely the object referred to as `?green` in the axiom. Currently, `v12` is at `pose(v12, v13)` and is supported by `v14`. To satisfy `on(v12, v18)`, `v12` needs to be placed on `v18`.
           
           However, the only action instance available is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not change the state of `v12` or `v18` in a way that would achieve the `on` predicate. It only moves the base from `v3` to `v3` via trajectory `#o0`. There are no pick or place actions available that would allow the robot to move `v12`. Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the provided actions.
