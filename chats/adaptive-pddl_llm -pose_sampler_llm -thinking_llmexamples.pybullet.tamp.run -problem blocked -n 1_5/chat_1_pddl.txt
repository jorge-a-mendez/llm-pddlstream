           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning through the Unreachable Goal**
           
           My primary objective is to devise a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a particular type ("green", specifically `v12` or `v8`) *on* `v18`. I first identify the relevant initial conditions and constraints.  `v12` and `v8` are candidates because they are the correct type.
           
           I then consider how the `on` predicate works, requiring objects to be *supported* at a specific *pose*.  I carefully examine the current state of the environment, noting the locations and supports for `v12` and `v8`. I then analyze the initial state,  understanding that I need to somehow move either `v12` or `v8` onto `v18`.
           
           My instinct is to use the standard *pick* and *place* actions to manipulate the objects.  I try to define the necessary parameters for these actions, considering arm configurations, poses, and other preconditions (like being *handempty*).  I see potential issues with the continuous parameters, but I believe I can resolve these using standard TAMP techniques. I then attempt to construct the `pick` and `place` action instances.
           
           However, I discover a critical constraint:  I'm limited to a *predefined list of valid action instances*.  I double-check the constraints and initial state again. The only allowed action is `move_base`. Therefore, I must conclude that the goal is *unreachable*.  I methodically explain why, highlighting the need for object manipulation, the lack of `pick` and `place` actions in the valid list, and therefore the impossibility of achieving the desired `on` state, which requires physical object movement.
