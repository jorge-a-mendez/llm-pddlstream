           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation Strategy**
           
           I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for an object (ID 10) on a given surface (surf_0). The object has dimensions of approximately 0.097 x 0.097, making it a nearly square object. The surface is an AABB (axis-aligned bounding box), and the object's dimensions suggest that rotations other than 0 or pi/2 won't optimize space utilization. Consequently, I'm going to start by focusing on placements with a rotation of 0 radians (no rotation).
           
           My approach will be to define a valid region on the surface where the object can be stably placed. This valid region's extent is determined by the object's dimensions and the surface boundaries. The center of the object must be placed within this region. I'll calculate the valid ranges for the object's center coordinates (x and y) by offsetting the surface boundaries by half the object's width and height, respectively. This gives me a "placement rectangle."
           
           Since the object is almost square, and the available surface has a similar aspect ratio, I will then partition this rectangle into a grid. This gives us 50 unique positions. I will use a simple, predictable and space efficient method of grid packing.
           
           The surface is defined by `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.  The object's dimensions are `size_x = 0.0972328646131011` and `size_y = 0.09723286461310188`.
           I will create a grid of 10 x 5 within the valid range. I will use the x and y ranges to calculate the step sizes.
           
           The generated list will be a direct output, without any extra formatting.
