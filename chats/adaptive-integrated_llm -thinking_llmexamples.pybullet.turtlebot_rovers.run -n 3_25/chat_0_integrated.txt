           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Action Instance Restrictions**
           
           Based on the problem setup and my analysis, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently *unreachable*. This conclusion stems from the strict constraint that only the provided action instances are valid.  The goal, in essence, requires obtaining images and analyses, which, given the problem's axioms, are only achievable through `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions. However, neither of these action instances are present in the *allowed* list. Further, the given `move` and `drop_rock` actions don't contribute to achieving the necessary preconditions for imaging, analyzing, or sampling.
           
           The given initial state restricts rover movement to self-loops, meaning they cannot reach locations suitable for the required imaging, communications, or sampling activities.  The initial configuration of `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` necessitates that rovers use actions that utilize these configurations, yet the existing *imagevisible* and *comvisible* predicates do not support these configurations.  Given these restrictions, the fundamental goal cannot be reached.
