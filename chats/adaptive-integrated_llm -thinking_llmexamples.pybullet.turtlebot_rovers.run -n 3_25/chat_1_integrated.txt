           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **A Detailed Plan for Axiom Completion**
           
           My primary goal is to achieve the state defined by `new-axiom@0()`. This involves several key steps that I need to meticulously execute. The situation I'm faced with requires me to first ensure that a series of preconditions are met, starting with imaging three distinct objectives: `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`. This demands the proper utilization of a rover to capture and transmit image data to a lander. This requires the rover to be properly positioned to image all three targets and then positioned in range of the lander for effective data transmission. Simultaneously, I must also ensure that analyses are received for each rock, categorized by their type - soil and stone. This involves sampling the rocks using the rover and then relaying the collected data to the lander.
           
           My plan breaks down the problem into these two critical facets: acquiring images and sending them, then sampling rocks and sending their analysis. To achieve this, I've divided the tasks between two rovers: `v12` and `v14`.
           
           Here’s the plan, step-by-step:
           
           **Rover `v12` will handle the image capture and transmission tasks.**
           
           *   **Move & Calibrate:** Rover `v12` will first move to a specific position (defined by `#o3`) to get a clear view of target `v17`. It will then calibrate its camera and capture the image. It will repeat this process for `v18` and `v19`, moving to appropriate positions for each imaging target.
           *   **Transmit Images:** After capturing the images, `v12` will move to a specific communication configuration near the lander (defined by `#o0`), where it'll send the images of `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` to the lander.
           
           **Simultaneously, `v14` will focus on rock analysis.**
           
           *   **Sampling:** Rover `v14` will move to a rock-sampling location (defined by `#o5`), and start the analysis process for all the available rocks.
           *   **Transmit Analyses:** After completing the process, it'll move to the communication configuration (#o0) and transmit the analyses to the lander.
           
           To execute this plan I need to determine these continuous parameters:
           
           *   The continuous values for each `#o3`. These represent specific poses required for a line-of-sight to the imaging targets. This involves rover coordinates for each pair `(v12, v17)`, `(v12, v18)`, and `(v12, v19)`.
           *   The continuous values for `#o0`, defining communication configuration for the lander, and the positions from which the rovers can send data. Rover `v12` (for lander `v9`) and rover `v14` (for lander `v9`) need to communicate with the lander.
           
           **Continuous Values:**
           
           I will generate (x, y) values for the continuous configurations:
           
           *   `(#o3 v12 #o4 v17)`: (1.8, 1.0)
           *   `(#o3 v12 #o4 v18)`: (0.8, 1.0)
           *   `(#o3 v12 #o4 v19)`: (-1.5, 1.5)
           *   `(#o0 v12 #o1 v9)`: (-0.5, -1.5)
           *   `(#o0 v14 #o1 v9)`: (-1.0, -1.5)
           
           By implementing this, I'll be able to acquire, transmit, and analyze all the required data to fulfill the objectives laid out and complete the `new-axiom@0()`.

It will then calibrate its camera and capture the image. It will repeat this process for `v18` and `v19`, moving to appropriate positions for each imaging target.
           *   **Transmit Images:** After capturing the images, `v12` will move to a specific communication configuration near the lander (defined by `#o0`), where it'll send the images of `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` to the lander.
           
           **Simultaneously, `v14` will focus on rock analysis.**
           
           *   **Sampling:** Rover `v14` will move to a rock-sampling location (defined by `#o5`), and start the analysis process for all the available rocks.
           *   **Transmit Analyses:** After completing the process, it'll move to the communication configuration (#o0) and transmit the analyses to the lander.
           
           To execute this plan I need to determine these continuous parameters:
           
           *   The continuous values for each `#o3`. These represent specific poses required for a line-of-sight to the imaging targets. This involves rover coordinates for each pair `(v12, v17)`, `(v12, v18)`, and `(v12, v19)`.
           *   The continuous values for `#o0`, defining communication configuration for the lander, and the positions from which the rovers can send data. Rover `v12` (for lander `v9`) and rover `v14` (for lander `v9`) need to communicate with the lander.
           
           **Continuous Values:**
           
           I will generate (x, y) values for the continuous configurations:
           
           *   `(#o3 v12 #o4 v17)`: (1.8, 1.0)
           *   `(#o3 v12 #o4 v18)`: (0.8, 1.0)
           *   `(#o3 v12 #o4 v19)`: (-1.5, 1.5)
           *   `(#o0 v12 #o1 v9)`: (-0.5, -1.5)
           *   `(#o0 v14 #o1 v9)`: (-1.0, -1.5)
           
           By implementing this, I'll be able to acquire, transmit, and analyze all the required data to fulfill the objectives laid out and complete the `new-axiom@0()`.
           

User:      Configuration #o3 = (0.5 0.5) for rover v12 at target v18 is not valid because the target is not visible from the rover's camera due to occlusion.

(Thoughts: **Refining the Plan: Overcoming Obstacles and Ensuring Reachability**
           
           Okay, so the initial plan has some snags. I need to get rover *v12* to snap some pics and rover *v14* to do some sampling, but the previous setup had issues: *v12* couldn't see target *v18* from its original position, couldn't reach *v19*, and was on a collision course.
           
           First, let's fix the visibility issue with *v18*. My analysis of the AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) and target locations suggests a move to `(0.6, 0.7)` for *v12* instead of the initial problematic position. This puts *v12* in range and avoids occlusion.
           
           Next up: reaching *v19*.  The original plan's *v12* position was unreachable. I'm suggesting a move to `(-1.0, 1.0)` for *v12* for imaging *v19*. It's within range and *should* be reachable, assuming a clear path.
           
           Finally, the collision concern. The initial plan had *v12* bumping into *v20*. To solve this, I'm repositioning *v12* for communication at `(0.0, -1.8)`. It's within range for communication with *v9* and clear of *v20*.
           
           For rover *v14*, I'm sticking with its home position of `(-1.0, -1.75)` for communication with *v9*. No issues. This position avoids conflicts with the obstacle *v20*.
           
           **Configuration Summary:**
           
           *   **v12 (imaging):**
               *   *v18*: `(0.6, 0.7)`
               *   *v19*: `(-1.0, 1.0)`
               *   *v9* (communication): `(0.0, -1.8)`
           *   **v14 (communication):** `(-1.0, -1.75)` (home)
           
           The overall plan structure will remain similar:
           
           1.  *v12* will take pictures, send those, then sample and send rock analyses.
           2.  *v14* samples and sends soil analyses.
           
           The proposed modifications to the plan address all the stated concerns, with each objective visible and all actions reachable. The plan will start with the rovers' respective initial states. The final planned operations should provide the appropriate visibility, and will make sure the specified conditions for the goal are met.

(Thoughts: **Detailed Configuration Analysis and Plan Refinement for Rover Tasks**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with re-evaluating the configurations for rover `v12` and ensuring they're valid based on user feedback. The core issue is that previous configurations for imaging and communication were deemed unreachable or occluded.  Specifically, there were problems with `v12`'s configurations for imaging targets `v17`, `v18`, `v19` and communicating with the lander `v9`.
           
           I began by closely examining the problematic configurations, noting that the rover's starting location is `(1.0, -1.75)` and the defined motion predicates only allow direct transitions between a few symbolic locations. I need to ensure that the chosen configurations are *both* reachable from the initial state *and* satisfy visibility constraints.  Reachability is tricky because it depends on the motion model which isn't explicitly defined.  My interpretation here is that "reachable" implies a short path or an existing direct motion.
           
           For *imaging* `v17`, which has a maximum imaging range of 2 meters, the original configuration `(1.5, 0.5)` for `v12` was too far. I found that if `v12` moves to a configuration of  `(1.5, 0.0)` it is both reachable from it's start pose, and within the imaging range of `v17`.  
           
           Similarly, for imaging `v18`, I determined that the configuration `(1.0, 0.0)` would be effective, as it's reachable and the geometry seems to avoid occlusion.
           
           Now for `v19`, which is the most challenging.  Initially, it seemed impossible for `v12` to handle due to the distance. However, I decided to switch up the task. Since the domain *allows* `v12` to perform imagevisible, I re-assigned `v19` to `v14`, and I will now define the configuration for the image to be taken with `v19` as the rover's initial position.
           
           My final configuration adjustments are as follows:
           
           For `v12`, now starting at position `(1.0, -1.75)`:
           *   Image `v17`:  Use `#o3 = (1.5, 0.0)`.
           *   Image `v18`:  Use `#o3 = (1.0, 0.0)`.
           *   Communicate with `v9`:  Use `#o0 = (0.5, -2.0)`.
           
           For `v14`, starting at position `(-1.0, -1.75)`:
           *   Image `v19`:  Use `#o3 = (-1.0, 1.0)`.
           *   Communicate with `v9`:  Use `#o0 = (-1.0, -1.75)` which is its initial configuration.
           
           Based on these new configurations, I will now re-write the execution plan. The overall strategy is still to have `v12` image targets and communicate, and then to have `v14` image and then communicate.  I've ensured that each configuration is both within reach and visible for the corresponding task. I need to make sure to interleave actions properly. I am assuming actions of type `move #o3 #o2 #o3` allow for the traversal of different instances of `#o3`.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Rover Task and Goal Unreachability**
           
           Okay, here's the situation as I understand it. I'm tasked with devising a plan for two rovers, v12 and v14, to achieve a specific goal. This goal involves imaging and analyzing specific objectives (v17, v18, v19) and rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8), with the analysis and images ultimately being received by a lander, v9, which means communicating with it. My initial focus was on the geometry of the scene and the reachable positions and path planning given the start conditions.
           
           The initial conditions show v12 starting at position v13 (1.0, -1.75) and v14 starting at v15 (-1.0, -1.75). The key problem here is the "not reachable" feedback I've been getting on previous attempts. Basically, it seems like v12 can't move much from its starting point. It's almost as if some unseen constraint is severely limiting its movement.
           
           I initially thought I could position v12 to image v17 and v18, which is on the far right and closer to v12 than v14. But this feedback saying the locations aren't reachable, even seemingly close locations, indicates some significant restrictions. I checked the distance to image targets from both rovers, and both are blocked by a thin wall on the y-axis, named v21.
           
           This wall is key, it is preventing communication for v12. So, v12 can't communicate with the lander v9 (which is on the far left), and can't image its objectives either. On top of that, v14 can't image v17 or v18, both are to far and the v21 blocking the line of sight.
           
           In summary, the specific placement of v21 makes it impossible for the rovers to satisfy the communication and imaging requirements. I've been thorough in my analysis of geometric and reachable area. Given that I have confirmed v12 cannot image any goals or send information, and v14 cannot image the necessary goals to complete the mission, I must conclude that the overall goal *new-axiom@0()* is currently *unachievable* within the constraints given. I'm sorry to say this mission is currently impossible.
