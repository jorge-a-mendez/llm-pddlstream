(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to provide 50 stable placements for a 0.07x0.07 object on a surface defined by the AABB `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.  Placement stability hinges on the object remaining fully within the surface's bounds, ignoring the z-coordinate.  I know the surface index will always be 0.
           
           Firstly, I calculate the valid *x* and *y* ranges for the object's center.  Since the object is a square, its rotation (`theta`) *doesn't* change its effective AABB size *when considering its bounding box to be aligned with the axes after rotation*. However, since the *object itself* is square and rotating the object by `theta` *does* change the effective AABB size, I must take this into account. The effective dimensions when rotated are `0.07 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))` and `0.07 * (abs(sin(theta)) + abs(cos(theta)))`, and with the given object dimensions, this is simplified to `0.07 * (sqrt(2) / 2 + sqrt(2) / 2) = 0.07 * sqrt(2)` for both. I then calculate the *new* valid area using this value.
           
           To generate diverse placements, I aim for a combination of rotation angles. I'll use `theta = 0` for 40 placements, which allows for the largest valid placement area, and `theta = pi/4` for the remaining 10.  For `theta = 0`, the center must be in `[4.235, 4.765]` for *x* and `[-0.565, -0.035]` for *y*.  For `theta = pi/4`, due to the increased dimensions, the bounds become `[4.249, 4.751]` for *x* and `[-0.551, -0.050]` for *y*. I then make 2 grids, one for the 0 placements and one for the pi/4.
           
           I generate x and y coordinates by creating a grid across the valid area (x_coords, y_coords). For the `theta=0` area, I used an 8x5 grid. For the `theta=pi/4` area, I used a 5x2 grid. Using those coordinates and my defined `surf_idx`, `theta`, and rounded *x* and *y* values, I create the full list of placements and check that my resulting list is exactly the requested 50. I've ensured no overlaps.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a new placement request. I need to figure out where to place object ID 10 on surface 0, making sure it doesn't collide with object ID 5, which is already placed. I have the coordinates of object 5 and the dimensions and shape of object 10, so let's get down to business.
           
           First, I need to understand the constraints and potential angles. The key here is avoiding collisions. I am going to calculate the valid placement zones for object 10 on surface 0 considering its square-like shape. Then I will need to consider the already placed object ID 5 and ensure I am not placing the new object where they will collide.
           
           I'll start by looking at the possible orientations. Since object 10 is essentially a square, rotating it will change the AABB dimensions. Let's start with `theta = 0` (no rotation). I have the starting object dimensions, which I can use to define a bounding box for object 10. Once I have the half dimensions, I will compare with the forbidden region where a collision with object 5 would occur. I need to calculate the *actual* collision region and determine where I can safely place object 10. Then repeat this for `theta = pi/4` to make sure I am fully aware of the area for collision avoidance.
           
           I have found the formula to calculate AABB and now it is time to use it. I will generate a number of points which avoids the overlapping region and fits within the bounds of the surface.
           
           I'll need to do the heavy calculations here, making sure to avoid floating-point errors. I will double-check my work before committing to final placement coordinates.
