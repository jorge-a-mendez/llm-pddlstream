           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.523, -0.109, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.378, 0.926).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.572, -0.159), (-4.473, -0.06)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be achieved if `on(green, v18)` and `type(green, v17)` are true.
           From the initial state, we know `type(v12, v17)` and `type(v8, v17)`. Thus, `green` could be either `v12` or `v8`.
           Let's consider `v8` as `green`. So we need to achieve `on(v8, v18)`.
           `on(v8, v18)` is true if there exists a pose `p` such that `supported(v8, p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, p)` are true.
           From the initial state, we have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `pose(v8, #o2)`. So, we need to achieve `atpose(v8, #o2)`.
           Currently, `atpose(v8, v9)` is true. So we need to pick `v8` from `v9` and place it at `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           The robot has arm `v4` and is at base configuration `v3`. The hand is empty.
           
           1. **Pick v8**:
              - `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`: This implies there is a pick trajectory `o4` to pick `v8` from pose `v9` using grasp `#o1` while at base config `#o3`.
              - `atpose(v8, v9)`: True in initial state.
              - `handempty(v4)`: True in initial state.
              - `atbconf(v3)`: True in initial state. For `kin` to be valid, `#o3` must be `v3`.
              - We need to check `unsafeapproach(v8, v9, #o1)` and `unsafeatraj(#o4)`. Since these are not given as true, we assume they are false.
           
           2. **Place v8**:
              - `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`: This implies a place trajectory `o4` to place `v8` at pose `#o2` using grasp `#o1` while at base config `#o3`.
              - `atgrasp(v4, v8, #o1)`: Will be true after picking.
              - `atbconf(v3)`: For `kin` to be valid, `#o3` must be `v3`.
              - We need to check `unsafepose(v8, #o2)` and `unsafeapproach(v8, #o2, #o1)` and `unsafeatraj(#o4)`. Since these are not given as true, we assume they are false.
           
           The action `move_base` is available but not strictly necessary if the `kin` actions are valid from the current base configuration `v3`. The `kin` predicates indicate that picking `v8` from `v9` and placing it at `#o2` can happen with the base at `#o3`. If `#o3` is `v3`, we don't need to move the base.
           
           Let's assume `#o3` is `v3` and that the robot can reach `v8` from `v3`.
           The current plan involves a pick and a place, which has a cost of 2.
           
           --Plan--:
           (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4)
           (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)
           
           --Poses--:
           (#o2 v8 v18): (4.5 0.25 0.8 0.0)

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The goal is `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which requires `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.
           Based on the initial state, `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`.
           Let's assume `green` is `v8`. Then we need to achieve `on(v8, v18)`.
           `on(v8, v18)` requires `supported(v8, p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, p)`.
           From the initial state, `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is true. So we need to achieve `atpose(v8, #o2)`.
           
           However, the only allowed action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.
           This action only changes the base configuration from `v3` to `v3` and unsets `canmove()`. It does not affect any object poses, nor does it allow for picking, placing, cleaning, or cooking actions.
           
           Since the goal requires changing the pose of an object (`v8`) from `v9` to `#o2` on `v18`, and there are no `pick` or `place` actions available, the goal is unreachable with the given allowed actions.
