           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to get these five objects – v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18 – all *on* object v20.  Based on the axioms, "on" means supported and at a particular pose. So, I need to figure out how to arrange the objects such that they are supported by v20.
           
           Initially, all these objects are sitting on v11, and importantly, there is a path supported for each from a #o2 pose on v20.  Therefore, my strategy is clear: I need to pick up each object from its current location on v11 and place it on v20.  However, this necessitates the base pose being able to achieve #o3.
           
           Now, I look at the available tools. I have arms v4 and v6. Only v4 seems to be relevant. The "kin" facts for v4 define how the arm and gripper interact with the objects.  Crucially, every single "pick" and "place" action requires the base configuration to be at #o3 according to the kinemation facts.  But here's the problem: The initial base configuration is at v3, and the only "move_base" action available merely shifts the base from v3 to v3 (an identity transformation).  
           
           This is a fundamental issue: I cannot move the robot base to the necessary configuration, #o3. The preconditions for picking and placing are, therefore, never met. Without the robot base being able to reach the correct configuration, my plan is doomed. I can't pick up or put down any of these objects.  I've checked the state, the facts and rules, I have a clear understanding, and the goal is simply not achievable with the given constraints and initial conditions.
