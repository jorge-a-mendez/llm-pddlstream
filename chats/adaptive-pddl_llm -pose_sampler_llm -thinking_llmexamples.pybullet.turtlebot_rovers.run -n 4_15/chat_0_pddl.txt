           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment: Goal Inachievable with Provided Actions**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of the problem and why I've concluded the goal state, `new-axiom@0()`, is unattainable given the provided information and constraints.
           
           The objective, `new-axiom@0()`, essentially demands I demonstrate knowledge of at least four images being successfully received, alongside the analysis of both a stone and soil type. This knowledge is derived from observing the `receivedimage()` and `receivedanalysis()` predicates, which are crucial.
           
           My analysis started by dissecting the axiom definition, quickly identifying the necessary components: receiving images of objectives `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`, alongside receiving the analyses of a rock and soil. The initial state analysis reveals that the initial state satisfies the other parts, such as the initial locations and stores.
           
           My reasoning then focused on understanding the actions needed to achieve these predicates, which naturally led to analyzing the `send_image`, `take_image`, and `calibrate` actions. However, a deeper examination of the initial state data and the allowed action instances revealed a critical problem.
           
           The provided action instances include only `move` and `drop_rock`. While the `move` actions satisfy the initial state predicates, their action has no effect on image transmission or analysis. `drop_rock` on the other hand, is blocked in its application due to the constraint that the initial state has `free(v12,v16)` and `free(v14,v16)`, which negates the required precondition `full(v, s)`. This severely limits my options.
           
           Since the allowed actions are severely restricted, and none directly influence the goal's requirements (`receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`), I'm forced to conclude that reaching the target state is impossible. The lack of actions related to imaging and analysis makes the goal inaccessible. There is no other conclusion given the constraints.
