           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if several conditions are met:
           1. Two rovers (v12 and v14) are at their respective configurations (v13 and v15). This is already true in the initial state.
           2. The storage `v16` is free for both rovers (v12 and v14). This is also true in the initial state.
           3. Images of objectives `v17` and `v18` are received in mode `v11`.
           4. Rocks `v2` and `v6` (represented by their types) are analyzed and the analysis is received. `v2` is the type for rocks `v3`, `v4`, `v1`, and `v6` is the type for rocks `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           
           Let's break down how to achieve the subgoals:
           
           For `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           - We need to `take_image` of `v17` and `v18` by a rover, then `send_image`.
           - Both rovers `v12` and `v14` have cameras (`v10`) onboard, which support mode `v11`.
           - `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates are given for both rovers and both objectives.
           - The camera needs to be calibrated before taking an image.
           - After taking the image, it needs to be sent to the lander `v9`.
           
           For `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (where `?stone` refers to type `v2` and `?soil` refers to type `v6`):
           - We need to `sample_rock` of type `v2` and `v6`, then `send_analysis`.
           - Rocks of type `v2` are `v1`, `v3`, `v4`. Rocks of type `v6` are `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           - Roamer `v12` is above rocks `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           - Roamer `v14` is above rocks `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           - We need to make sure the store `v16` is free before sampling. This is true initially for both rovers.
           - We will need to sample one rock of type `v2` and one of type `v6`.
           
           The provided valid actions are only `move` and `drop_rock`. This means that the goal is likely unachievable with the given constraints, as there are no `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` actions available, which are necessary to fulfill the subgoals of receiving images and analyses. The `new-axiom@0` goal explicitly requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`, which are effects of actions not available to be executed.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the provided allowed actions.
           
           The goal is not achievable with the provided list of allowed actions. The necessary actions for taking images, sending images, sampling rocks, and sending analysis are not present in the allowed actions.
