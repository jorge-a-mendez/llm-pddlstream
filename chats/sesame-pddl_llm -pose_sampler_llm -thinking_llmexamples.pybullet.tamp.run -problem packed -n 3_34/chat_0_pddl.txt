           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Here's my thought process for generating 50 stable placements for the object:**
           
           I've been given a square object (ID 5) with dimensions 0.09376053632175119 x 0.09376053632175119, and a square surface defined by the AABB from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135) (Surface 0).  The core requirement is that all placements must be stable, meaning the object is entirely contained within the surface boundaries.
           
           Because the object is square, the effective half-extents of its AABB doesn't depend on whether it's rotated or not. So rotating by 90-degree increments, at most, matters. I know that rotating the square object doesn't fundamentally change the AABB boundaries relative to its center.
           
           To ensure stability, I need to account for the object's size and how it changes when rotated. The object's half-dimension is `half_s = 0.046880268160875595`. To be fully contained, the object's center must be within a smaller square area inside the original surface. This inner square's dimensions depend on the largest effective half-extent of the object's AABB for all possible angles (theta).
           
           The maximum effective half-extent occurs when the object is rotated by 45 degrees (`theta = pi/4`), which is  `max_effective_half_s = half_s * sqrt(2) = 0.066304855139`. Conversely, the minimum half extent is `half_s = 0.046880268160875595` and this occurs at 0 and multiples of 90 degrees.
           
           I decided to take a conservative approach, so I'll create a grid using the maximum effective half-extent boundaries. This means that my safe placement region is centered and smaller than the surface: x and y values will range from approximately -0.0687 to 0.0687.
           
           I'll generate 25 placements at 0 degrees and another 25 at pi/4, covering a total of 50. For `theta = 0`, I'll make a 5x5 grid of x and y values that are in the range `[-0.07, 0.07]`.
           For `theta = pi/4`, I'll use a 5x5 grid with `x` and `y` values in the range `[-0.05, 0.05]`.
           I think that a grid with these x, y coordinates is sufficient for 50 diverse placements.
           
           **Here are the resulting placements:**
           
           *   **Theta = 0:**
               *   (0, 0.0, -0.07, -0.07)
               *   (0, 0.0, -0.07, -0.035)
               *   (0, 0.0, -0.07, 0.0)
               *   (0, 0.0, -0.07, 0.035)
               *   (0, 0.0, -0.07, 0.07)
               *   (0, 0.0, -0.035, -0.07)
               *   (0, 0.0, -0.035, -0.035)
               *   (0, 0.0, -0.035, 0.0)
               *   (0, 0.0, -0.035, 0.035)
               *   (0, 0.0, -0.035, 0.07)
               *   (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.07)
               *   (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.035)
               *   (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
               *   (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.035)
               *   (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07)

(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Placing Object 4**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to place object 4, a square, on surface 0 without colliding with the existing object 5.  I've been given some specific parameters to work with: the size of object 4, the surface boundaries, and the known location of object 5.  My plan is this:  I need to generate a set of diverse placement options, ensuring I meet a diversity requirement, and then systematically filter out any placements that would cause object 4 to overlap with object 5.
           
           First, I had to account for the angle, considering both `theta=0` and `theta=pi/4`. I calculated that for `theta=0`, the effective half-extent of object 4 is equal to half its side length (`eff_s_4 = 0.04638`), while for `theta=pi/4`, it's multiplied by the square root of 2 (`eff_s_pi4 = 0.06560`).  I'll need to keep this in mind during the filtering process.
           
           My first approach was to generate a grid of potential placements and check each one. I started with a smaller grid and found that it was too restrictive.  Object 5 is quite close to the corner, so I had to be careful with the ranges I considered. Object 5 is located within `x in [-0.11688, -0.02312]` and `y in [-0.11688, -0.02312]`. To avoid collisions, my strategy is simple: I generate the AABB of object 5's possible locations, then I calculate each object 4's AABB for a given `x,y` position and filter out any points that result in AABB overlap.
           
           I then expanded this grid, generated 25 placements for `theta = 0` and 25 for `theta=pi/4`, which is the correct number of placements for an acceptable level of diversity. To make sure that I generate the right number of points for each rotation, I'll repeat the same grid and then run each position's AABB through the filter. By testing the points, I can determine the final set of non-colliding locations.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 6**
           
           The user has tasked me with finding 50 stable placements for Object 6 (a square) on Surface 0, avoiding collisions with Object 5 and Object 4.  My primary challenge is to work within the constraints of the surface boundaries and the known positions of the obstacles.
           
           **Key Parameters & Strategy**
           
           *   **Object 6:**  Side length `s_len_6 = 0.074904...`.  The effective half-side length, *crucial for AABB calculations*, changes depending on the object's orientation (`theta`).
           *   **Surface 0:** Defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. This sets my *working area*.
           *   **Obstacles:** Object 5 and Object 4, which are essentially immovable "no-go zones". Their positions and sizes are well-defined. I need to calculate their Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for efficient collision detection.
           
           **The Approach**
           
           1.  **Effective Half-Side Length:**  I calculated how `theta` impacts the 'effective' half side length of Object 6 using  `effective_s_6(theta) = s_obj_6 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This value determines how much space Object 6 takes up in a given orientation, therefore impacting the space around it.
           2.  **Placement Constraints:**  Valid placements must fit inside Surface 0 and *not overlap* with Object 5 or Object 4 (using their precomputed AABBs).
           3.  **Rotation Strategy:**  To cover all placement possibilities and fit more objects in, I decided to focus on two orientations: `theta = 0` (aligned with the axes) and `theta = pi/4` (rotated 45 degrees). This gives me the least and the most space needed.
           4.  **Grid Generation:**  For each orientation, I create a grid of potential center points (`cx`, `cy`) within the valid range of Surface 0, carefully adjusting the bounds based on the effective half-side length at each orientation.  I set up grids for both the straight and rotated placements.
           5.  **Collision Checks:**  For each potential placement, I test for containment on the surface and against the AABBs of Object 4 and Object 5. If a collision is detected, the placement is rejected.
           6.  **Iteration and Collection:** I iterate through the grids, checking each `(cx, cy)` position, storing valid placements in a list. I'm aiming for 50 valid placements.
           
           **Code Logic & Refinements**
           
           *   A dedicated collision check function ( `check_collision()`) is crucial. This uses the pre-calculated AABBs and quickly determines if two boxes overlap.
           *   I carefully calculate the valid ranges for `cx` and `cy` based on the surface size and effective half-side length.
           
           I run the script. It generated two lists of possible points. The script should efficiently check potential placements, filtering out those that result in collisions. I can be sure to have 50 placements. It is very likely since I created grids on a larger surface than required, and the rotation gives the flexibility to fill the valid surface area.
