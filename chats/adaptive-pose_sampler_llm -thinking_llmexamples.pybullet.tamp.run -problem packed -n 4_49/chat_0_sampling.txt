(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation for Object ID 4**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 4 on a given surface. This object is essentially a small square, with dimensions of roughly 0.0989 x 0.0989. The surface itself is a square centered at (0,0) and extends from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           First, I need to ensure the object is fully contained within the surface for *every* possible rotation. Since the object is nearly a perfect square, I can calculate a worst-case scenario. When rotated, the object's AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) will be largest at 45 degrees. I calculate the maximum half-dimension of this rotated AABB, which comes out to approximately 0.07.
           
           To ensure stability, I'll use a slightly smaller range for the object's center coordinates (x and y).  The safe range for the center of the object must be within `[-0.065, 0.065]` for both x and y.
           
           To achieve 50 placements, I'll create a grid of x and y coordinates within this safe range, along with two rotation angles: 0 degrees and 45 degrees (pi/4 radians). This approach will efficiently create diverse placements. The specific coordinates will be `x = [-0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06]` and `y = [-0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06]`. With 5 points in each dimension and two angles, this will produce the 50 placements needed. The surface index `surf_idx` will always be 0.

(Thoughts: **Scene Setup and Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed object 4, and now I need to figure out where to put object 5 without them bumping into each other. I've been given some feedback confirming that one of my previous placements (ID 4) worked, so that's good.
           
           First things first, I need to get the dimensions of object 4. I already know that it's sitting at (surf_idx=0, theta=0.0, x=-0.06, y=-0.06), and from that information, I've calculated its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box). The dimensions, (size_x, size_y) = (0.0989, 0.0989), are pretty close to a square shape and it means the AABB coordinates are: `x: [-0.1094, -0.0105], y: [-0.1094, -0.0105]`.
           
           Now, object 5 has the dimensions (size_x, size_y) = (0.0926, 0.0926). It's also a near-square shape, and slightly smaller than object 4. I am dealing with rotations, and this shape is going to have to be rotated.
           I'm also dealing with a surface. the surface 0 has a range: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I need to ensure that the objects are within this range.
           
           The surface bounds are `x: [-0.135, 0.135]`, and the same for `y`.
           
           To avoid any overlap, I will consider placements where the objects are not touching.
           
           The strategy I'll use is to calculate the bounding boxes for different orientations (theta = 0, pi/4) and check for collision between object 4's AABB and object 5's possible positions. I have decided to use the same "grid" approach as before but make it more robust.
           
           I've got the following placements for x and y: `[-0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06]`.
           
           I need to make a note to not place these too close, or I may have collisions.
           
           I've considered that the maximum AABB extent for object 5 is `0.131`.
           
           To avoid collision, I need to make sure the AABB of object 5 doesn't overlap with the AABB of object 4.
           
           The formula for the new placement (x,y) rotation is based on the AABB calculation of object 4, with dimensions `half_x = 0.0494`, `half_y = 0.0494` and object 5, `half_x = 0.0463`, `half_y = 0.0463`.
           Object 5 can be placed at `theta = 0` or `theta = pi/4`, as in this case there are two major AABB orientations. I can simply avoid the region `(-0.06, -0.06)` because this has a likelihood of collisions.
           
           Based on the known dimensions, when `theta = 0`, I can place it at `(0.06, 0.06)`, I calculate the AABB and can see that there will be no collisions as the x, y values are not in the existing AABB of the original object.
           
           The calculations for collision are:
           
           Object 4 has a bounding box of `x: [-0.10946, -0.01053]`, `y: [-0.10946, -0.01053]`
           
           And based on this, I iterate over the coordinates, and I will filter the AABB results to prevent collisions.
           
           The coordinates for object 5 are:
           
           `theta=0`:
           x: [-0.106313, -0.013687], y: [-0.106313, -0.013687] -> collide
           x: [-0.076313, -0.013687], y: [-0.106313, -0.013687] -> collide
           x: [-0.046313, 0.046313], y: [-0.106313, -0.013

(Thoughts: **Collision-Free Object Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, so I've got this new object, ID 7, that needs 50 stable placements on surface 0.  The catch? I need to avoid crashing into objects 4 and 5, which are already fixed on the surface.  First, I'll figure out the surface size, which is a square centered at (0,0) with a side length of 0.27.
           
           Now, the important bit: the AABBs for the existing objects.  Object 4 is centered at (-0.06, -0.06), with dimensions approximately 0.0989 x 0.0989, and has its AABB range in x from -0.10946 to -0.01054, and in y from -0.10946 to -0.01054. Object 5 is at (0.05, -0.065), with a size of roughly 0.0926 x 0.0926, giving it an AABB x range of 0.00369 to 0.09631 and a y range of -0.11131 to -0.01869.  I've got the object 7's dimensions, roughly 0.0728 x 0.0728.
           
           Since this new object is basically a square, the most difficult situation is at 45 degree rotation, so the max safe size range for object 7 on surface 0 is [-0.08352, 0.08352].
           
           My plan is to try a grid search and check for collisions. I'll use a grid of points with x and y coordinates from -0.08 to 0.08 (inclusive), incrementing by 0.02, giving me 9 x 9 positions and then will rotate the object 4 ways (0, pi/4, pi/2, and 3*pi/4). I will get rotated aabbs using known formulas. For each position and each rotation, I'll calculate object 7's AABB.
           
           To determine if there's a collision, I'll check if the AABBs of object 7 and the obstacles have any overlap.  If there's *no* overlap in either the x or y directions, then there is no collision.
           
           I started iterating and calculating by hand, but this is a bit too tedious. I will automate this using code. I will use the code that does collision checking. The code generated the list of placement locations that avoid collisions. I will filter and remove the invalid positions and ensure I have 50.

(Thoughts: **I've got a task: find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 6) on surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into any of the three existing objects (ID 4, 5, and 7).** I need to be precise about this and will be relying on my knowledge. The surface is a simple rectangle, and I've already calculated the object's dimensions: its half-extent is about 0.044, and when rotated at pi/4, the maximum rotated extent is about 0.062. This defines my safe range for the center of the new object on the surface.
           
           I've got the precise positions and sizes of the three existing objects (Object 4: [-0.109, -0.010] x [-0.109, -0.010], Object 5: [0.003, 0.096] x [-0.111, -0.018], and Object 7: [-0.116, -0.043] x [0.003, 0.076]).  These are all AABB.
           
           **To strategize,** I'll generate potential centers for the new object and test them with several rotations. I'll test it for collisions against my surface constraints and the obstacles' AABB. I'll try the common rotations: 0, pi/4, pi/2, and 3*pi/4, but I also know that in general rotation won't matter that much because the new object is a square. So the strategy is to generate candidate positions and test rotations. I know that if the generated AABB for the current position and rotation does not overlap in x and y coordinates with the AABB of the obstacles, then it is a valid placement. If the overlap test passes, it is collision.
           
           **Now, let's execute:** I'm going to systematically generate candidate (x, y) coordinates from the valid range, iterate the 4 rotations for each point, and check for collisions. With the AABB for each obstacle calculated, it is very simple to check if my generated AABB overlaps any of those. I'll focus on the area around the other objects to find the placements.
           I'll begin checking the points. I'm focusing on the outer edge points first, and then work inwards.
           Using some of my domain knowledge and simple reasoning, I can filter to get valid positions.
           The top-right quadrant should be clear.

Model:     **I've got a task: find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 6) on surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into any of the three existing objects (ID 4, 5, and 7).** I need to be precise about this and will be relying on my knowledge. The surface is a simple rectangle, and I've already calculated the object's dimensions: its half-extent is about 0.044, and when rotated at pi/4, the maximum rotated extent is about 0.062. This defines my safe range for the center of the new object on the surface.
           
           I've got the precise positions and sizes of the three existing objects (Object 4: [-0.109, -0.010] x [-0.109, -0.010], Object 5: [0.003, 0.096] x [-0.111, -0.018], and Object 7: [-0.116, -0.043] x [0.003, 0.076]).  These are all AABB.
           
           **To strategize,** I'll generate potential centers for the new object and test them with several rotations. I'll test it for collisions against my surface constraints and the obstacles' AABB. I'll try the common rotations: 0, pi/4, pi/2, and 3*pi/4, but I also know that in general rotation won't matter that much because the new object is a square. So the strategy is to generate candidate positions and test rotations. I know that if the generated AABB for the current position and rotation does not overlap in x and y coordinates with the AABB of the obstacles, then it is a valid placement. If the overlap test passes, it is collision.
           
           **Now, let's execute:** I'm going to systematically generate candidate (x, y) coordinates from the valid range, iterate the 4 rotations for each point, and check for collisions. With the AABB for each obstacle calculated, it is very simple to check if my generated AABB overlaps any of those. I'll focus on the area around the other objects to find the placements.
           I'll begin checking the points. I'm focusing on the outer edge points first, and then work inwards.
           Using some of my domain knowledge and simple reasoning, I can filter to get valid positions.
           The top-right quadrant should be clear.
