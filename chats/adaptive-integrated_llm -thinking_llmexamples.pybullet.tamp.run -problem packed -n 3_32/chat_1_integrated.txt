User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.288, 0.396), (-0.217, 0.467)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.276, -0.465), (-0.178, -0.367)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.095, 0.303), (-0.003, 0.395)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.252, 0.432, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.702, 0.712).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.227, -0.416, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.33, 0.944).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.049, 0.349, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.834, 0.552).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Plan and Reasoning**
           
           As an expert in planning, I've thoroughly analyzed the problem and its constraints. My objective is to create a plan to move objects v8, v12, and v14 onto surface v16, starting from their initial positions on surface v11.  I've considered that to satisfy the goal, each object must be placed on v16, which requires support by and an appropriate pose at v16.
           
           I examined the available actions – `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`. Since the goal involves moving objects, `clean` and `cook` are irrelevant.  The system initially possesses the ability to move (`canmove()`).  A key point is the given action instance: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. However, the availability of only this instance presents a major challenge because this is the *only* action that can be used.
           
           I investigated the `kin` predicates, which specify the robot's ability to manipulate objects.  These predicates require specific poses, grasps, and base configurations. A critical observation is that the placement poses are uniformly specified by `#o2`. I needed to understand what this implied for assigning unique continuous values to the poses for each object.
           
           I realized I must define three separate placement poses within the confines of v16.  Based on the problem's AABB information, I assumed the objects were small enough to fit. After that, I decided on the following:
           *   v14: x=-0.08, y=0.0, z=0.781, theta=0.0
           *   v8: x=0.0, y=0.0, z=0.781, theta=0.0
           *   v12: x=0.08, y=0.0, z=0.781, theta=0.0
           
           However, I've uncovered a crucial impediment. The only allowed action instance is the static `move_base`. Without access to *any* `pick` or `place` action instances, I'm fundamentally incapable of constructing a plan that moves the objects. Therefore, based on the provided constraints, achieving the goal is impossible.
           
           In the end, even though I went through the motions of planning, I have to state that the problem is unsolvable with the provided tools.
