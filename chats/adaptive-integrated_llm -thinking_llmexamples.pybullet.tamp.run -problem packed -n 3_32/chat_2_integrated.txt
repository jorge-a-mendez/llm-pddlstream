           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.288, 0.396), (-0.217, 0.467)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.276, -0.465), (-0.178, -0.367)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.095, 0.303), (-0.003, 0.395)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.252, 0.432, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.702, 0.712).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.227, -0.416, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.33, 0.944).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.049, 0.349, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.834, 0.552).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning to Arrange Objects on a Target Surface**
           
           Okay, so the goal is clear: I need to get three objects—`v8`, `v12`, and `v14`—onto `v16`. They're currently on `v11`, and the robot needs to do some picking and placing. The initial state and available predicates provide the geometric information (AABB data, support surface etc.) for the robot to operate in.
           
           My strategy involves a straightforward pick-and-place sequence for each object. First, pick each object from its initial pose on `v11`, using the robot's arm (`v4`). Then, place the picked object onto `v16` at a specific pose. Since all objects must end up on `v16`, I'll need to work out distinct placement poses on `v16` for each one of them.
           
           Now, let's look at the action details. For the pick action, I use `(pick v4 v* v* #o1 #o3 #o4)` where `*` stands for the object name. To achieve the goal for placing, I use the `(place v4 v* #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)` action. The continuous parameter named `#o1`, `#o3`, and `#o4` will remain fixed for all pick and place actions, for all three objects.
           
           The `kin` predicates confirm the valid arm trajectory, grasp type, and base configuration. The actions are valid for all three objects.
           
           Now, let's plan the action steps.
           1.  **Move the robot base:** The robot is initially at `v3`, but the picking/placing actions depend on `bconf(#o3)`. Therefore, a move_base is needed.
           2.  **Pick:** For each object, a pick action is executed.
           3.  **Place:** For each object, after picking, a place action is executed.
           
           To actually place objects, I must assign proper continuous values and locations. 
           The main challenge will be choosing valid, collision-free placements on `v16`. Since I'm an expert in this, I'll go through this carefully.
           
           Now, let's consider the initial object poses and their associated bounding boxes.
           
           *   `v8`: Currently at pose `v9`, with AABB ((-0.288, 0.396), (-0.217, 0.467))
           *   `v12`: Currently at pose `v13`, with AABB ((-0.095, 0.303), (-0.003, 0.395))
           *   `v14`: Currently at pose `v15`, with AABB ((-0.276, -0.465), (-0.178, -0.367))
           
           Then, I will consider `v16`, which seems to be my target surface. It has AABB ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           I need three distinct poses on `v16` to place the objects. Let's make sure the objects aren't touching or overlapping. Since v16 is quite small, I'll choose some well-defined locations, to ensure there won't be any collision.
           
           Let's select placement poses using offsets from the center of `v16`:
           
           For `v14` : (-0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0) with `#o2` named `#o2_v14`.
           For `v12`: (0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0) with `#o2` named `#o2_v12`.
           For `v8`: (-0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0) with `#o2` named `#o2_v8`.
           
           For the base configuration, `#o3`, I'll use (-0.5, 0.0, 0.0) to make sure there's enough room for both picking from `v11` and placing on `v16`.
           
           Now for the full plan:
           
           1.  `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)` (Using continuous value for bconf, #o3, at (-0.5 0.0 0.0))
           2.  `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           3
)
