User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.095, 0.303), (-0.003, 0.395)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.252, 0.432, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.702, 0.712).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.288, 0.396), (-0.217, 0.467)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.049, 0.349, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.834, 0.552).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.227, -0.416, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.33, 0.944).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.276, -0.465), (-0.178, -0.367)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Goal and Available Actions**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with devising a plan to achieve the goal of placing objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto surface `v16`. Currently, these objects are at different poses: `v8` at `v9`, `v12` at `v13`, and `v14` at `v15`, all supported by `v11`.  The robot has two arms, both empty, and its base is at `v3`. The only action I'm allowed to use is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This feels extremely restrictive.
           
           Initially, I had a glimmer of hope because the initial state defines `grasp(v8, #o1)`, `grasp(v12, #o1)`, and `grasp(v14, #o1)`. This suggests a generic grasp for these objects.  And also `pose(v8, #o2)`, `pose(v14, #o2)`, and `pose(v12, #o2)` with `supported(obj, #o2, v16)`.  This `#o2` is a generic target pose.
           
           However, the crucial constraint is the list of available actions. The instructions explicitly state that *only* the actions in that list can be used.  And the only action is `move_base`. So I can't use `pick` or `place` or anything else. The `move_base` action is essentially a no-op movement, albeit one that consumes `canmove()` and adds to the cost.
           
           **Problem of Limited Actions**
           
           The heart of the problem lies in the absence of `pick` and `place` actions.  To satisfy the goal `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`, I need to ensure that `atpose(v8, #o2)`, `atpose(v12, #o2)`, and `atpose(v14, #o2)` are true, respectively (since `supported(v8, #o2, v16)`, `supported(v12, #o2, v16)`, and `supported(v14, #o2, v16)` are initially true).
           
           Currently, these atoms are all false, as the objects are at different poses (`v9`, `v13`, and `v15`). The only way to change an `atpose` predicate is through `pick` and `place` actions.  A `pick` negates the current `atpose` fact, and a `place` asserts it at the new pose.  Since these actions are absent from my available action list, I have no means to manipulate the positions of the objects.
           
           **Conclusion: Unreachable Goal**
           
           The `move_base` action is simply not sufficient to change the positions of the objects. Therefore, I conclude that the goal is unreachable.  I am confident in this answer given the strict constraint on allowed actions.  Any plan needs to change the state by using allowed actions, which means this goal cannot be completed.
