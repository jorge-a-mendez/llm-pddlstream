           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning to Place Objects on a Surface**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. The goal is to get all of these objects - v8, v12, v14, and v16 - onto surface v18.  Right now, they're sitting on surface v11.  The tools I have are a robot arm (v4) and some basic motion primitives.
           
           Here's the problem: I've got a robot arm, and I need to move these objects from their current locations to v18. The available actions are `pick` and `place`, and it looks like a `move_base` action will be needed as well. Since the robot is initially at configuration `v3`, but the `pick` and `place` actions depend on being in configuration `#o3`, I'll start with that `move_base` action.
           
           The crucial constraint is that each `place` action targets a generic pose, denoted by `#o2`. The trick is that I can't put the objects in the *same* location.  I need to find *four* unique poses, all on `v18`. I'm going to leverage the fact that I can define the coordinates to achieve this.
           
           Here's the plan, step-by-step:
           
           1.  **Move to the right base configuration:** I need to perform a `move_base` to get from `v3` to configuration `#o3`.
           2.  **Pick and Place Cycle for each object:**  Then, I'll repeat the following for each object:
               *   **Pick:**  Use the `pick` action to grasp the object from its current location.
               *   **Place:** Use the `place` action to put the object on `v18` at the appropriate location.
           
           To ensure each object is placed uniquely, I'll define four unique poses for `#o2` on `v18`. Considering the dimensions of v18, I will choose four points within v18's AABB for the objects to be. Since the z-coordinate seems constant at 0.781 for the existing poses, I'll keep that. I choose four corner coordinates within v18.
           
           Here's a detailed example: For v8, I will define a unique pose on v18 with values that I've chosen that will work for placement, and repeat this for the other objects.
           
           And that's it!  Assuming my coordinate choices work out, all the objects should be on `v18`.

           Please provide a plan and poses that achieves the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all poses are valid and stable.

(Thoughts: **Updated Placement Strategy for Stability**
           
           My initial plan was rejected because the object placements weren't stable, specifically because their 2D AABBs weren't fully contained within the surface's AABB. I need to revisit the AABB calculations to determine the problem.
           
           The surface `v18` has an AABB of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`, giving it a width/height of 0.27. The given AABBs for the objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` are absolute, not relative. Previous error messages pointed out the object's AABB relative to the given pose. Using this information, I reexamined the error and calculated that the objects are essentially 0.07x0.07 in size, regardless of the AABB the objects had.
           
           To ensure stability, I need to place these objects within a safe margin of the surface's boundaries. Since they're about 0.07 wide, their centers should be within the range [-0.1, 0.1]. Thus, the new coordinates will place the objects near the edges, but within this safe area:
           
           *   **v8:** (-0.07, -0.07)
           *   **v12:** (0.07, -0.07)
           *   **v14:** (-0.07, 0.07)
           *   **v16:** (0.07, 0.07)
           
           These new positions will ensure that their AABBs are fully contained within the surface `v18`. These will keep z at 0.781 and theta at 0.0, as before.
           
           The plan structure itself remains correct. It will involve moving the base, picking up each object, and then placing them in their new, stable positions.
           
           The cost analysis (move\_base + 4\*pick + 4\*place) should also remain the same, although the euclidean distance component of the move action depends on the coordinate of `#o3`.
