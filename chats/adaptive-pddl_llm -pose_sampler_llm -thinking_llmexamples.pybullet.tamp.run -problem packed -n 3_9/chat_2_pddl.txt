           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my plan to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`:**
           
           First, I need to recognize the starting point. I see those objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`) are all currently *on* `v11` right now. My goal is to get all of them supported by `v16`. Since I'm working with known poses, `#o2` looks like the place where the robot should place these objects since it's where they can be supported by `v16`.
           
           The actions I have at my disposal are the standard `pick`, `place`, and `move_base`. The robot has a single arm (`v4` is the only controllable arm). The initial base configuration is `v3`.
           
           I start by checking the preconditions for any action that might be relevant. It looks like I need to move the base *first* since the `pick` and `place` actions all need `atbconf(#o3)`. So, the base moves from `v3` to the configuration `#o3`.
           
           Then, I'll need to do the following, in order:
           
           1.  **Move the base to `#o3`.**
           2.  **Pick up `v8` from its current pose (`v9`)**. I'll do this using a `pick` action with arm `v4`.
           3.  **Place `v8` at pose `#o2` on `v16`**. This is done with a `place` action.
           4.  **Pick up `v12` from its pose (`v13`)**. Again with the `pick` action.
           5.  **Place `v12` at pose `#o2` on `v16`**. Using a `place` action.
           6.  **Pick up `v14` from its pose (`v15`)**.
           7.  **Place `v14` at pose `#o2` on `v16`**.
           
           I need to make sure that the `place` actions work. So, I will need to assume that objects at `#o2` will not cause a collision (I will need to consider whether `#o2` is an area where objects are safely co-located. I'm assuming that it is, given that no negative preconditions regarding collisions are explicitly stated). Otherwise, the problem can't be solved as formulated!
           
           That's the plan. It's a series of pick-and-place operations. The base needs a single move, and after that, the robot arm can safely move each object to the correct position.
