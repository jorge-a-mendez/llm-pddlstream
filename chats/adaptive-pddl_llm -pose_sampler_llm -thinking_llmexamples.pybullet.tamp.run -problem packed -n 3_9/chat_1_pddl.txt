           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to get objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`.  Essentially, I need to move these objects from their current poses, currently supported by `v11`, and place them onto `v16` at a specific pose.  The axioms for `on(?o, ?r)` are clear: I need to ensure that each object is both supported by `v16` and at the correct pose.
           
           I started by looking at the initial state. I have two empty hands and the robot *can* move. `atbconf(v3)` sets my base configuration and `ataconf` specifies my arm configurations.  Crucially, I also have the `kin` facts which provide the key information for *pick* and *place* actions.
           
           Now here's the problem. The *kin* facts are telling me that I *could* potentially use my arm `v4` to move these objects.  However, the *move_base* action instance provided restricts me to moving the base from `v3` to `v3` only. The robot can't change from `v3` base configuration to any of the configurations that *would* be required for the *kin* actions (specifically, `#o3`).  The provided list of valid action instances is strictly limited to `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This implies that *no other actions* can be used. Furthermore, I wasn't provided any *pick* and *place* actions.
           
           So, while I have the *kin* facts that give me the *possibility* of performing *pick* and *place*, the action list does not give any valid *pick* and *place* actions and, crucially, I cannot move my base to a configuration that *would* be compatible with them.
           
           In essence, the problem is unsolvable because the available actions are insufficient to achieve the goal state. I need a way to change the base configuration to something other than `v3` (e.g. `#o3`) *and* I need valid instances of *pick* and *place*. Since neither of those are possible given the strict constraint on the valid action list, I cannot complete the task.
           
           In summary: I need to *pick* and *place* but I can't.
