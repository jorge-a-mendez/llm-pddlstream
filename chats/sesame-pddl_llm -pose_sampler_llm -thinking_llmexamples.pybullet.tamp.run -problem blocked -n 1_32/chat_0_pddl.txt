           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's break this down for object 5 and surface 0.** I need to generate 50 stable placements, and I'm treating this like a geometry puzzle, using my understanding to ensure these placements will work.
           
           The object is nearly square (0.07 x 0.07), and the surface is a 0.6 x 0.6 rectangle. The key is that the object's dimensions are quite small relative to the surface, which gives me some flexibility.
           
           The basic layout is that the rotated, rectangular object's bounding box needs to be completely within the surface's bounding box after I apply some rotation (`theta`) and positioning (`x`, `y`). I know the formula for the rotated bounding box width and height, given the object's original dimensions and the rotation angle.
           
           I realized that since the object is nearly square, its effective bounding box shape doesn't change *drastically* with rotation. This means that a few carefully chosen rotations and positions will cover a lot of options.
           
           My strategy will be to systematically vary the rotation (`theta`). I chose 5 angles (`0`, `pi/8`, `pi/4`, `3pi/8`, and `pi/2`). I calculate the valid *x* and *y* range for the bounding box after each of these rotations, and then place the object's center within the valid ranges, giving a variety of placements.
           
           I am ensuring the placements are stable and inside the surface's bounding box by using the calculated `x` and `y` range.
           
           I just went through the calculations to ensure that I had 50 unique placements by calculating the valid placement ranges and generating x and y points inside these ranges.
           
           Finally, I'm presenting the results in the required format: `(surface index, theta in radians, x, y)`. I will verify one more time, but I think that is it.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement for Object ID: 10, Avoiding Collisions with Previous Object ID: 5**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. We've got a new request for Object ID 10, a nearly square object with dimensions slightly larger than the previous Object ID 5.  The key here is that any placement for Object ID 10 needs to steer clear of the successful placements of Object ID 5. Since all those ID 5 objects were placed at theta = 0, we can use their original dimensions to determine the space to avoid.
           
           First, I identified the occupied x-ranges from the ID 5 objects on Surface 0, which are two strips: `[4.2, 4.27]` and `[4.73, 4.8]`.  To prevent collisions, the new placements for Object ID 10 need to go into the open x-dimension strip. From this, the new valid x-range for Object ID 10  becomes  `[4.27 + rotated_w/2, 4.73 - rotated_w/2]` where `rotated_w` depends on the new object's rotation angle.
           
           We need to place object ID 10 in Surface 0. Surface 0 is the area between `(4.2, -0.6)` and `(4.8, 0.0)`. So the only constraint for the y-positions for the new placements, is the dimensions of the new rotated object, and the surface itself. Therefore, given the new object's rotation angle, there are no collision concerns to consider for y-dimension, as long as it fits inside Surface 0. I calculated the appropriate effective `rotated_h` as a function of the rotation angle. Then the valid y range becomes  `[-0.6 + rotated_h / 2, 0.0 - rotated_h / 2]`.
           
           I'll generate placements across five angles: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2. For each angle, I will select two x-positions (minimum, maximum from our valid x range) and evenly spaced y-positions (within the surface and rotation constraints). I will generate 5 y positions evenly spaced to fit within the valid y-range for 50 placements in total.
           
           By following this strategy, I'm ensuring there won't be collisions with existing ID 5 placements and that I cover an even and diverse set of potential positions across the whole surface.
