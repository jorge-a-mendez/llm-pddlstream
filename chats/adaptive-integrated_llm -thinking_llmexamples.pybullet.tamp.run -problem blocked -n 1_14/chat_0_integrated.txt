User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.372, 0.449), (-4.275, 0.545)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.324, 0.497, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.96, 0.28).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom type(v12, v17)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom type(v8, v17)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom stackable(v8, v18)
           Atom graspable(v15)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom stackable(v15, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v14)
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom stackable(v12, v18)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom pose(v15, v16)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Reachability of `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, so the task is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`.  This boils down to making sure an object, let's call it `?green`, is both `on(v18)` and has the `type(v17)`. My initial focus is on identifying objects that already possess the `type(v17)` property, as that seems like the more fundamental constraint. I see `v12` and `v8` fit the bill.
           
           Now, I need to get either `v12` or `v8` onto `v18`.  The 'on' predicate is defined in terms of `supported` and `atpose`.  So, the crux of the problem is finding a pose `?p` for either `v12` or `v8` such that they are both supported by `v18` and actually *at* that pose.
           
           Looking at the initial state, I see that both `v12` and `v8` have existing supported relationships and poses. Specifically, `v12` is on `v14`, and `v8` is on `v11`. However, I need to check if there is a 'supported' predicate that states that either `v12` or `v8` *are* supported by `v18`. If this is true, then if `atpose` matches also for `v18` it would suffice to have it true.
           
           To move either object to `v18`, I would need 'pick' and 'place' actions. But when I examine the available action instances, I find only `move_base`. This is a significant roadblock. It means I *cannot* manipulate the objects. I can only move the robot's base, which won't change where `v12` or `v8` are, since it cannot interact with the objects.
           
           The problem statement also makes it clear that the only allowed action is `move_base`, and no additional action instances can be used.  This definitively shuts down the possibility of achieving the goal, because no objects can be moved to satisfy the constraints of the axioms.
           
           So, since I can't move the necessary objects to v18 and the goal isn't already true, I can conclusively say the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently unreachable given the available actions.
