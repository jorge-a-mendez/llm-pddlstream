User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.372, 0.449), (-4.275, 0.545)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.324, 0.497, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.96, 0.28).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           Atom kin(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unachievable with Provided Actions**
           
           My objective is to devise a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of `type v17` *on* `v18`. I've analyzed the initial state and identified two objects, `v12` and `v8`, both of `type v17`.  To achieve the goal, I need to make either `on(v12, v18)` or `on(v8, v18)` true.
           
           The *on* predicate requires both *supported* and *atpose* conditions to be met. I've examined the initial state and found existing *supported* predicates, such as `supported(v12, v13, v14)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`, indicating that `v12` is *on* `v14` and `v8` is *on* `v11`. However, neither `on(v12, v18)` nor `on(v8, v18)` are true initially.
           
           I then considered the required actions.  The *on* predicate can only be achieved if `atpose` and `supported` change.  I've checked the available action instances, and the *only* action available is `move_base`. This is a significant constraint. *Move_base* only modifies the robot's configuration, not the object's positions or support relationships.  Specifically, `move_base` does not alter `atpose` or `supported` predicates.
           
           Since the goal requires changing the location of an object (`v12` or `v8`) onto `v18` or `supported(vX, #o2, v18)` and `atpose(vX, #o2)`, this can't happen with move_base, therefore *the objective is unattainable*.
