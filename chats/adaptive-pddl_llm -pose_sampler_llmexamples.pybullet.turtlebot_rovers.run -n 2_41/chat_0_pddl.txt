User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is enclosed by walls at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5, as indicated by bounding boxes 0-4. There's a central vertical wall at x=0 (box 5). There are also several smaller obstacles scattered around the scene, some are in the corners (7, 8, 9, 10), and some are smaller, thinner boxes (6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20). My strategy is to select points that are relatively far from these obstacles and that provide a good view of the target. I will prioritize points that are not too close to the x=0 axis, as it is a major obstacle.
