           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(v_stone)` for rocks of type `v2` (stone), and `receivedanalysis(v_soil)` for rocks of type `v6` (soil).
           
           Rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75), and rover `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). Both rovers have camera `v10` which supports mode `v11`. Both rovers have free storage `v16`. Lander `v9` is available for communication.
           
           Objectives for images are `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           Rocks: `v1`, `v3`, `v4` are of type `v2` (stone). `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are of type `v6` (soil).
           
           To achieve the goal, we need to:
           1. Calibrate a camera.
           2. Take images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19` and send them.
           3. Sample rocks of type `v2` and `v6` and send their analysis.
           
           Let's break down the tasks for each rover to minimize movement and maximize efficiency.
           
           Rover `v14` is at `v15` and `v12` is at `v13`.
           Both rovers have `comvisible` at `#o0` with `v9` and `imagevisible` at `#o3` for `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           Both rovers also have `above` at `#o5` for all rocks.
           
           **Image Objectives:**
           We need to take images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19` and send them.
           Let's use rover `v14` for image tasks as it is closer to some of the objective bounding boxes, and we can make the most efficient use of its movement to #o3 and #o0.
           1. `v14` calibrates its camera `v10` at `#o3` using `v17`.
           2. `v14` takes images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19` at `#o3`.
           3. `v14` moves to `#o0` to send images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19` to `v9`.
           
           **Analysis Objectives:**
           We need to analyze a rock of type `v2` (stone) and a rock of type `v6` (soil).
           Type `v2` rocks: `v1`, `v3`, `v4`.
           Type `v6` rocks: `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           Let's use rover `v12` for analysis tasks.
           1. `v12` moves to `#o5` to sample rocks.
           2. `v12` samples a rock of type `v2` (e.g., `v4`).
           3. `v12` samples a rock of type `v6` (e.g., `v5`).
           4. `v12` moves to `#o0` to send analysis of `v4` and `v5` to `v9`.
           
           We should prioritize using existing configurations over generating new ones. The plan uses `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` which are already defined in the initial state.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(v_stone)` for rocks of type `v2` (stone), and `receivedanalysis(v_soil)` for rocks of type `v6` (soil).
           
           Rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75), and rover `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). Both rovers have camera `v10` which supports mode `v11`. Both rovers have free storage `v16`. Lander `v9` is available for communication.
           
           Image Objectives: `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           Rock types: `v2` (stone), `v6` (soil).
           Specific rocks: `v1`, `v3`, `v4` are type `v2`. `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are type `v6`.
           
           To achieve the goal, we need to:
           1. Calibrate a camera.
           2. Take images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19` and send them.
           3. Sample rocks of type `v2` and `v6` and send their analysis.
           
           Let's use rover `v14` for image tasks and rover `v12` for analysis tasks.
           
           **Image Tasks (Rover v14):**
           - `v14` is initially at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           - `imagevisible` predicates are available for `v14` at `#o3` for objectives `v17`, `v18`, `v19`. The bounding boxes for `v17` is ((2.042, 1.755), (2.141, 1.853)), `v18` is ((-1.947, 2.046), (-1.857, 2.136)), and `v19` is ((0.434, 1.864), (0.533, 1.963)).
           - A suitable configuration for `#o3` for `v14` to see `v17`, `v18`, `v19` needs to be chosen. Given `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75), and the objects are in the positive y direction (north), moving to a central position for image capture would be efficient. A good position could be around (0.0, 0.0) or (0.0, 1.0) to have clear line of sight to all three objectives which are spread out. Let's aim for a configuration that can see `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` which are located generally to the north. A configuration like (0.0, 1.0) might work.
           - `comvisible` predicate is available for `v14` at `#o0` for `v9` (lander at (-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). A communication configuration needs to be near the lander. Let's set `#o0` for `v14` to (-1.5, -2.0) to be close to `v9`.
           
           **Analysis Tasks (Rover v12):**
           - `v12` is initially at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           - `above` predicates are available for `v12` at `#o5` for all rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`).
           - `v4` (type `v2`) is at ((-1.941, 1.379), (-1.856, 1.463)). `v5` (type `v6`) is at ((1.587, -1.105), (1.717, -0.975)).
           - A configuration `#o5` for `v12` that is above both `v4` and `v5` would be ideal. `v5` is close to `v12`'s initial position. However, `v4` is far. Since only one sample is needed for each type, and `above(v12, #o5, v4)` and `above(v12, #o5, v5)` are given, we need to choose a single `#o5` for sampling both. Let's use a configuration that is close to a rock of each type. `v3` is type `v2` and is at ((2.044, -1.798), (2.147, -1.695)), which is closer to `v12` than `v4`. `v5` is type `v6` and is at ((1.587, -1.105), (1.717, -0.975)). So, a configuration like (1.8, -1.5) could be above `v3` and `v5`.
           - `comvisible` predicate is available for `v12` at `#o0` for `v9`. Similar to `v14`, let's set `#o0` for `v12` to (-1.5, -2.0).
           
           Let's refine the configuration choices to ensure reachability and line-of-sight.
           
           For `v14` to see `v17`, `v18`, `v19` (imagevisible at #o3):
           - `v17` is (2.042, 1.755) to (2.141, 1.853)
           - `v18` is (-1.947, 2.046) to (-1.857, 2.136)
           - `v19` is (0.434, 1.864) to (0.533, 1.963)
           These are all in the upper part of the map. `v14` is at (-1.0, -1.75). Let's pick a configuration in the positive y-direction, say (0.0, 1.0). This position is within 2 units from `v19` and within 4 units for `v17` and `v18`.
           (#o3 v14 #o4 v17): (0.0, 1.0)
           (#o3 v14 #o4 v18): (0.0, 1.0)
           (#o3 v14 #o4 v19): (0.0, 1.0)
           
           For `v14` to communicate with `v9` (comvisible at #o0):
           - `v9` is (-2.405, -2.346) to (-1.395, -1.654).
           - `v14` is initially at (-1.0, -1.75).
           Let's choose a configuration near `v9`, e.g., (-1.5, -2.0). This is within 4 units.
           (#o0 v14 #o1 v9): (-1.5, -2.0)
           
           For `v12` to be above rocks (above at #o5):
           - `v12` is at (1.0, -1.75).
           - `v4` (type `v2`) is at ((-1.941, 1.379), (-1.856, 1.463)). This is far.
           - `v3` (type `v2`) is at ((2.044, -1.798), (2.147, -1.695)). This is close to `v12`.
           - `v5` (type `v6`) is at ((1.587, -1.105), (1.717, -0.975)). This is close to `v12`.
           We need one `#o5` for both sample actions. Let's select a config that is above both `v3` and `v5`. A config around (1.8, -1.5) seems appropriate.
           (#o5 v12 #o2 v3): (1.8, -1.5)
           (#o5 v12 #o2 v5): (1.8, -1.5)
           
           For `v12` to communicate with `v9` (comvisible at #o0):
           - `v12` is at (1.0, -1.75). `v9` is (-2.405, -2.346) to (-1.395, -1.654).
           - To communicate with `v9`, `v12` would also need to move towards `v9`. Let's use the same communication configuration as `v14` for `v9` since it's a good central point near the lander.
           (#o0 v12 #o1 v9): (-1.5, -2.0)
           
           Plan:
           1. `v14` calibrates its camera at `#o3` with `v17`.
           2. `v14` takes images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19` at `#o3`.
           3. `v14` moves from `#o3` to `#o0` (communication configuration).
           4. `v14` sends images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19` to `v9`.
           5. `v12` moves from `v13` to `#o5` (sampling configuration).
           6. `v12` samples rock `v3` (type `v2`) and `v5` (type `v6`) at `#o5`.
           7. `v12` moves from `#o5` to `#o0` (communication configuration).
           8. `v12` sends analysis of `v3` and `v5` to `v9`.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(v_stone)` for rocks of type `v2` (stone), and `receivedanalysis(v_soil)` for rocks of type `v6` (soil).
           
           Rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75), and rover `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). Both rovers have camera `v10` which supports mode `v11`. Both rovers have free storage `v16`. Lander `v9` is available for communication.
           
           Image Objectives: `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           Rock types: `v2` (stone), `v6` (soil).
           Specific rocks: `v1`, `v3`, `v4` are type `v2`. `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are type `v6`.
           
           We need to choose collision-free configurations for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the configurations:
           
           **Obstacles:**
           - `v20`: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1)) - This is a thin vertical wall along the y-axis at x=0.
           - `v9`: AABB(lower=[-2.4047, -2.3455502384913305, 0.0], upper=[-1.3952999999999998, -1.6544497615086693, 0.40766007847975994]) - This is the lander.
           
           **Image Tasks (Rover v14):**
           - `v14` is initially at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           - Objectives `v17`, `v18`, `v19` are in the upper part of the map.
           - The previous `#o3` (0.0, 1.0) collided with `v20` (x=0 wall). We need to move away from x=0.
           - `v17` is ((2.042, 1.755), (2.141, 1.853)). `v18` is ((-1.947, 2.046), (-1.857, 2.136)). `v19` is ((0.434, 1.864), (0.533, 1.963)).
           - Since `v14` starts at (-1.0, -1.75), moving to the left side of the `v20` wall for `v18` and `v19` might be better, or to the right for `v17` and `v19`.
           - Let's try to find a configuration for `#o3` for `v14` that avoids `v20` and can see `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           - A configuration like (-1.0, 1.0) would avoid `v20` and be within range of `v18` and `v19`. It would be out of range for `v17` (distance to `v17` from (-1.0, 1.0) is approx sqrt((2.0- (-1.0))^2 + (1.8 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt(3^2 + 0.8^2) = sqrt(9 + 0.64) = sqrt(9.64) which is > 2).
           - Since all three images are required, we might need to take images from two different locations or find a single location that works.
           - The `imagerange` is 2 for `imagevisible`. `v17` is around (2.1, 1.8), `v18` is around (-1.9, 2.0), `v19` is around (0.5, 1.9).
           - Given the `v20` wall at x=0, no single point directly in front of all three will work. We can split the tasks: `v14` takes images of `v18` and `v19` from one side, and `v12` takes image of `v17` from the other side. Or we can have `v14` take all images from different spots.
           - Let's try to have `v14` handle all images. `v14` is currently at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           - For `v18` and `v19`: a config like (-0.5, 1.0) seems okay. `v18` is at (-1.9, 2.0), `v19` is at (0.5, 1.9). Dist to `v18` from (-0.5, 1.0) is sqrt((-1.9 - (-0.5))^2 + (2.0 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt((-1.4)^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1.96 + 1) = sqrt(2.96) > 2 (range 2). So (-0.5, 1.0) is also not suitable for `v18`.
           - Let's choose a configuration for `#o3` for `v14` that can see `v19` (0.5, 1.9) and is not at x=0. How about (0.7, 1.0)? Dist to `v19` is sqrt((0.5-0.7)^2 + (1.9-1.0)^2) = sqrt((-0.2)^2 + 0.9^2) = sqrt(0.04+0.81) = sqrt(0.85) < 2. This works for `v19`.
           - For `v17` (2.1, 1.8), a point like (2.0, 1.0) would be good. Dist to `v17` is sqrt((2.1-2.0)^2 + (1.8-1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.1^2 + 0.8^2) = sqrt(0.01+0.64) = sqrt(0.65) < 2.
           - For `v18` (-1.9, 2.0), a point like (-1.8, 1.0) would be good. Dist to `v18` is sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.8))^2 + (2.0-1.0)^2) = sqrt((-0.1)^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(0.01+1) = sqrt(1.01) < 2.
           - This requires `v14` to move to multiple `#o3` points. This is possible by using multiple `#o3` configurations. Let's use three distinct configurations for the three objectives to ensure collision-free and visibility.
           - `#o3_v17` for `v17` at (2.0, 1.0).
           - `#o3_v18` for `v18` at (-1.8, 1.0).
           - `#o3_v19` for `v19` at (0.7, 1.0).
           - For simplicity, let's designate `#o3_v17`, `#o3_v18`, `#o3_v19` as new continuous objects. This is not allowed, we must use the given #o3. So, we must find one config #o3 for all.
           - Since all objectives are north of current rover position, and x=0 is a wall. We have to pick either x<0 or x>0. Let's try picking a point on the right (x>0) side of the wall. Rover `v14` is at (-1.0, -1.75). It needs to cross `v20`.
           - This problem is complex because of the `v20` wall at x=0 and `imagerange` 2.
           - Let's re-examine `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)`. This indicates that #o3 is a *single* configuration that can see all three. This would mean that #o3 cannot be at x=0 if v20 is a wall.
           - If `imagevisible` allows for a single `#o3` to see multiple objectives, then the positions of `v17`, `v18`, `v19` imply that `#o3` needs to be far enough to get all in view, but the `imagerange` is 2. This is a contradiction. The problem statement says any action instance not in the given list is not allowed. We have `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)`. This means there is indeed a *single* configuration `#o3` for rover `v14` that can see `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`. The same applies to `v12`.
           - Given the `imagerange` limit of 2, and the spread of `v17` (2.1, 1.8), `v18` (-1.9, 2.0), `v19` (0.5, 1.9), there is no single point that is within 2 units of all of them. This implies that the initial `imagevisible` predicates might be for a scenario where `imagerange` is larger, or these specific locations are not what is used.
           - However, since the problem states "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan" and "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is false", and we have these `imagevisible` predicates, we must assume they are valid under the right `#o3` configuration. The axiom for `imagerange` could be broader than 2. The instruction states "The maximum distance from the rover to the target is 2 for `imagevisible` and 4 for `comvisible`." This is a global constraint.
           - This suggests that a single configuration `#o3` for `v14` cannot see `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` simultaneously if they are widely spread AND the range is 2. There might be an issue with problem formulation or the provided objects. However, I must proceed as if such a configuration exists.
           
           Let's assume the previous configuration choices were problematic only due to collision and not inherent impossibility to see all objects within range.
           
           **New Configuration Search:**
           
           **Image Tasks (Rover v14):**
           - Objectives `v17`, `v18`, `v19` are spread.
           - Obstacle `v20` is a wall at x=0.
           - `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           - We need an `#o3` that is collision-free with `v20`. Let's try x=0.1 (right of the wall). For y, try y=1.5. So, `#o3` for `v14` is (0.1, 1.5).
               - Dist to `v17` (2.1, 1.8) from (0.1, 1.5): sqrt((2.1-0.1)^2 + (1.8-1.5)^2) = sqrt(2^2 + 0.3^2) = sqrt(4+0.09) = sqrt(4.09) > 2. This config is still not valid for `v17`.
           
           This is a critical issue. The `imagevisible` predicates exist for all three objectives with a single `#o3` AND the `imagerange` is 2. Given the coordinates, it's impossible to satisfy this.
           However, I must assume that the given actions are valid.
           Since I must assume the existence of a valid `#o3` that satisfies all `imagevisible` conditions and is collision-free, I need to try different coordinates.
           
           Let's try to find a configuration for `#o3` that satisfies the image visibility constraints, avoiding `v20` (x=0).
           If `v14` is at (-1.0, -1.75), maybe a configuration closer to the middle of the range of X coordinates for the objectives, but still on the left side of `v20` or sufficiently far to the right to see them all.
           Let's choose `x = -0.1` (just left of the wall).
           For `y`, let's try `y = 0.0` or `y = 0.5`.
           `v17`: (2.042, 1.755)
           `v18`: (-1.947, 2.046)
           `v19`: (0.434, 1.864)
           
           Consider `#o3` at (-1.0, 0.0)
           Dist to `v17`: sqrt((2.1-(-1.0))^2 + (1.8-0.0)^2) = sqrt(3.1^2 + 1.8^2) = sqrt(9.61 + 3.24) = sqrt(12.85) > 2 (fail)
           
           This confirms that there is an inherent contradiction in the problem statement if `imagerange` is strictly 2 and `imagevisible` applies to a single `#o3` for all three widely separated objectives.
           However, I must proceed as if a solution exists. I'll attempt to place the configuration as close as possible to one of the objects while remaining collision free, hoping the `imagevisible` implies the range issue is handled implicitly.
           
           Let's pick an `#o3` which is close to one target and ensures collision freedom.
           For `v14` and `#o3`: `v14` starts at (-1.0, -1.75).
           Let's try to put `#o3` for `v14` on the left side of the `v20` wall (x<0).
           Try `#o3` = (-1.0, 1.0). This should be collision-free with `v20`.
           - dist to `v18` ((-1.947, 2.046)): sqrt((-1.947 - (-1.0))^2 + (2.046 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt((-0.947)^2 + (1.046)^2) = sqrt(0.8968 + 1.0941) = sqrt(1.99) < 2. This works for `v18`.
           - dist to `v19` ((0.434, 1.864)): sqrt((0.434 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.864 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt(1.434^2 + 0.864^2) = sqrt(2.056 + 0.746) = sqrt(2.802) > 2. This fails for `v19`.
           
           This is highly problematic. I will assume the problem expects me to find a **single** #o3 that is collision-free and implicitly meets range requirements because the `imagevisible` predicates are given. I will choose a configuration that is *not* in collision and is somewhat central, prioritizing one objective if necessary.
           
           Let's try: `#o3` for `v14` to be at `(-0.5, 0.5)`. This is left of `v20`.
           `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). The path from `v15` to `(-0.5, 0.5)` does not cross `v20`.
           
           **Comms Tasks (Rover v14 and v12):**
           - Lander `v9` AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
           - Previous choice for `#o0` was (-1.5, -2.0) which collided with `v9`.
           - We need to choose a point *near* `v9` but *not inside* `v9`.
           - Let's try `#o0` at (-1.5, -1.5). This is still close to `v9` but outside its upper y-bound.
               - `v9` upper y is -1.654. So -1.5 is above it. This should be collision-free.
           - This configuration is outside the lander `v9`'s bounding box. Distance to `v9` from `(-1.5, -1.5)` is minimal as it's directly above the lander. The `comrange` is 4, so this should be fine.
           
           **Sample Tasks (Rover v12):**
           - `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           - Rocks: `v3` (type `v2`) at ((2.044, -1.798), (2.147, -1.695)). `v5` (type `v6`) at ((1.587, -1.105), (1.717, -0.975)).
           - Previous choice for `#o5` was (1.8, -1.5). This is collision-free with `v20` and `v9`. It is also plausible to be above both `v3` and `v5`. Let's keep this one.
           
           **Revised Configurations:**
           
           - `#o3` for `v14` for `v17`, `v18`, `v19`: Let's try `(-0.5, 0.5)`. This is collision-free with `v20`.
           - `#o0` for `v14` for `v9`: `(-1.5, -1.5)`. This avoids `v9` collision.
           - `#o5` for `v12` for `v3`, `v5`: `(1.8, -1.5)`. This is collision-free.
           - `#o0` for `v12` for `v9`: `(-1.5, -1.5)`. This avoids `v9` collision.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(v_stone)` for rocks of type `v2` (stone), and `receivedanalysis(v_soil)` for rocks of type `v6` (soil).
           
           Rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75), and rover `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). Both rovers have camera `v10` which supports mode `v11`. Both rovers have free storage `v16`. Lander `v9` is available for communication.
           
           Image Objectives: `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           Rock types: `v2` (stone), `v6` (soil).
           Specific rocks: `v1`, `v3`, `v4` are type `v2`. `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are type `v6`.
           
           We need to choose collision-free, reachable configurations for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`.
           
           **Obstacles:**
           - `v20`: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1)) - This is a thin vertical wall along the y-axis at x=0.
           - `v9`: AABB(lower=[-2.4047, -2.3455502384913305, 0.0], upper=[-1.3952999999999998, -1.6544497615086693, 0.40766007847975994]) - This is the lander.
           
           **Reachability and Collision Avoidance for Configurations:**
           
           **Communication Configuration (#o0 for both rovers to lander v9):**
           - Lander `v9` AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
           - Previous choice for `#o0` was (-1.5, -1.5), which was still in collision with `v9` (specifically, it's above the upper y-bound, but the x-range is still within).
           - A safe communication point must be outside the lander's AABB. Let's try placing it to the far left of the lander, for example.
           - `v9`'s minx is -2.405, miny is -2.346.
           - Let's try `#o0` at (-2.5, -2.0). This should be outside the lander's AABB and within comrange (4 units).
               - `v14` is at (-1.0, -1.75). Reaching (-2.5, -2.0) is plausible.
               - `v12` is at (1.0, -1.75). Reaching (-2.5, -2.0) involves crossing the `v20` wall, which is not good.
           - Therefore, we need *two* different communication configurations, one for each rover, on their respective sides of the `v20` wall, both visible to `v9`.
           - For `v14` (starting at -1.0, -1.75), let `#o0_v14` be `(-2.5, -2.0)`. This should be reachable and collision-free from `v9`.
           - For `v12` (starting at 1.0, -1.75), reaching `v9` which is at x=-2 is problematic due to `v20` at x=0. There are no communication configurations on the right side of the map visible to `v9`. The given `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` implies such a configuration exists. This is another contradiction/limitation.
           - Given `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` is provided, there must be a configuration `#o0` that works for `v12` to communicate with `v9`. Given `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)` and `v9` is at `x=-2`, and there's a wall at `x=0`, for `v12` to communicate with `v9`, it must either move around the wall (if possible) or there's an occlusion-free path from the right side of the wall. Assuming `v12` moves around, it would be a long path.
           - Let's pick a collision-free and reachable point for `v12` to communicate with `v9` on its current side of the map, even if the line-of-sight means going around the wall. The task implies such a point exists. Let's try `(0.5, -2.0)`. This will be on the right side of `v20`, but might be too far from `v9` for `comvisible`. However, we have `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`, so some `#o0` will work.
           - It's highly likely that `#o0` is a configuration that is intended to be used by both rovers. Let's re-try placing `#o0` at a very generic location to communicate with `v9`, but not colliding with it, and also reachable by both. A configuration far from the lander's actual bounding box, but within range of communication. How about `(-1.0, -1.0)`? This would be outside `v9` and avoid `v20`. `v14` is at (-1.0, -1.75), `v12` is at (1.0, -1.75). For `v12` to reach (-1.0, -1.0), it needs to cross `v20` (x=0). This would involve a `move` action.
           
           The problem implies single continuous objects. So, `#o0` should be a single configuration. This requires a configuration that is:
           1. Collision-free with `v9` and `v20`.
           2. `comvisible` to `v9` for both `v12` and `v14`.
           3. Reachable by both `v12` and `v14` (possibly with intermediate moves).
           
           Let's place `#o0` for communication in a common area.
           `v9` is mostly in `x<0`. Let's try `(-0.5, -2.0)`. This is outside `v9`'s AABB.
           - `v14` from (-1.0, -1.75) to (-0.5, -2.0): reachable. No collision with `v20`.
           - `v12` from (1.0, -1.75) to (-0.5, -2.0): requires crossing `v20`. This is the issue.
           
           Given the `motion` predicates in the initial state, such as `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o0)` and `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o0)`, it *must* be possible for both rovers to reach `#o0` from their initial positions `v13` and `v15` respectively, potentially traversing `v20` via `motion` and `test-cfree-ray-conf-negative` not applying. This is a strong hint that the `v20` wall might not always act as a blocking obstacle for motion, or there are gaps. If `v20` is an obstacle for configurations, it should also be for motion.
           
           Let's assume the continuous values for `motion` actions implicitly account for `v20`.
           We need an `#o0` that is collision-free with `v9`.
           `v9` AABB upper y = -1.654.
           Let's try `#o0` as `(-1.0, -1.0)`. This is outside `v9`'s AABB and far from `v20`.
           - `v14` from (-1.0, -1.75) to (-1.0, -1.0): reachable.
           - `v12` from (1.0, -1.75) to (-1.0, -1.0): requires crossing x=0. Given the motion predicates, we assume this is allowed.
           
           **Image Configuration (#o3 for v14):**
           - `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           - Objectives `v17` (2.1, 1.8), `v18` (-1.9, 2.0), `v19` (0.5, 1.9).
           - Previous `#o3` = (-0.5, 0.5) was not reachable. Rover path from `v15` to `(-0.5, 0.5)` is fine, so perhaps the "reachable" check is more complex.
           - Let's try `#o3` at `(-1.0, 1.0)`. This is on the left side of `v20`.
               - `v14` from (-1.0, -1.75) to (-1.0, 1.0): reachable.
               - Collision with `v20`: no.
               - Visibility range (max 2):
                   - `v18` (-1.9, 2.0): sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.0))^2 + (2.0 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt((-0.9)^2 + 1.0^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 1) = sqrt(1.81) < 2. OK.
                   - `v19` (0.5, 1.9): sqrt((0.5 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.9 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt(1.5^2 + 0.9^2) = sqrt(2.25 + 0.81) = sqrt(3.06) > 2. Fails for `v19`.
                   - `v17` (2.1, 1.8): sqrt((2.1 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.8 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt(3.1^2 + 0.8^2) = sqrt(9.61 + 0.64) = sqrt(10.25) > 2. Fails for `v17`.
           - This confirms the issue with a single `#o3` for all three widely spread objectives with range 2.
           - Since the problem states `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, etc., it implies such a configuration exists, even if it contradicts the hardcoded range of 2 given the current object coordinates. I will proceed by picking a configuration that is at least collision-free and reachable and let the system decide if it satisfies `imagevisible`. I have to pick a configuration, so I will pick one that is far from the wall and somewhat central.
           - Let's try `#o3` for `v14` at `(0.0, 1.0)` again, assuming the `v20` collision error was due to point coordinates, and `test-cfree-ray-conf-negative` for `blocked` might be more complex than just AABB check. If it's a "wall", maybe it's not actually an obstacle for the *rover's base* if it's thin or low. Given `v20` height is 0.1. A rover is usually taller. So maybe it's not a collision for the base itself. Let's try (0.0, 1.0) again. If that's still an issue, I'll move it slightly. Let's try (0.0, 1.0) for #o3. If it's still a collision for configuration, try `(0.1, 1.0)`.
           
           **Sampling Configuration (#o5 for v12):**
           - `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           - Rocks: `v3` (type `v2`) at ((2.044, -1.798), (2.147, -1.695)). `v5` (type `v6`) at ((1.587, -1.105), (1.717, -0.975)).
           - Previous `#o5` = (1.8, -1.5) was marked as not reachable.
           - `v12` starts at (1.0, -1.75). (1.8, -1.5) is a short move. Why is it not reachable?
           - Maybe the path `v13 -> (1.8, -1.5)` is blocked by `v3` or `v5` themselves (if rover AABB is larger)? Or, perhaps the reachability checker is more complex.
           - Let's choose a point that is very close to `v13` but still above rocks.
           - `v3` is around (2.1, -1.7). `v5` is around (1.6, -1.0).
           - Let's try `#o5` = `(1.5, -1.6)`. This point is close to `v3` and `v5` and very close to `v12`'s initial position `v13`.
               - `v12` from (1.0, -1.75) to (1.5, -1.6): very short path, should be reachable.
               - Collision with `v20`: no.
               - Collision with `v9`: no.
           
           **Final Attempt with Revised Configurations:**
           
           - `#o3` for `v14` for `v17`, `v18`, `v19`: `(0.1, 1.0)`. (Slightly right of `v20` wall at x=0).
           - `#o0` for `v14` for `v9`: `(-1.0, -1.0)`. (Collision-free with `v9` and `v20`).
           - `#o5` for `v12` for `v3`, `v5`: `(1.5, -1.6)`. (Close to `v12`'s start, above rocks, collision-free).
           - `#o0` for `v12` for `v9`: `(-1.0, -1.0)`. (Same as for `v14`, assuming reachability across `v20` is handled by `motion`).

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(v_stone)` for rocks of type `v2` (stone), and `receivedanalysis(v_soil)` for rocks of type `v6` (soil).
           
           Rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75), and rover `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). Both rovers have camera `v10` which supports mode `v11`. Both rovers have free storage `v16`. Lander `v9` is available for communication.
           
           Image Objectives: `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           Rock types: `v2` (stone), `v6` (soil).
           Specific rocks: `v1`, `v3`, `v4` are type `v2`. `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are type `v6`.
           
           We are facing persistent issues with collision and reachability for the continuous parameters. This implies my understanding of "collision-free," "reachable," and "occlusion-free line-of-sight" might be too simplistic based on the given AABBs and explicit negative feedback. The continuous values are proving difficult to find without more information on the exact rover shape, terrain, and detailed environment properties.
           
           Let's re-examine the core problem and the constraints:
           1.  **A single `#o3` for all `imagevisible` predicates:** This is the most problematic given the `imagerange` of 2 and the spread of `v17`, `v18`, `v19`. If this is truly enforced by the problem's implicit geometry, then a solution might not exist without a larger `imagerange`. However, since these `imagevisible` actions are explicitly available, I must assume such an `#o3` configuration exists and is valid. My best approach is to try to find one that is "most likely" to work from a generic geometric sense, and is collision-free.
           2.  **`v20` (wall at x=0) collisions:** My attempts to place `#o3` at `x=0.1` still resulted in collision. This means the collision check is either very sensitive, or the rover's width is substantial, meaning `x=0.1` is still overlapping `v20`'s `upper=(0.05...)`. If `v20` is (-0.05, 0.05) in x, then `x=0.1` is just outside. This might indicate the robot itself has width and collides if its center is at `x=0.1`.
           3.  **`v9` (lander) collisions:** My attempts to place `#o0` inside or near `v9`'s AABB resulted in collisions. I need to move it further away from `v9`.
           4.  **Reachability:** This is the hardest to guess without a path planner. "Not reachable" could mean a path is blocked, or the distance is too great for a single `move` action, or there are unstated obstacles. The `motion` predicates for `#o2` exist. This implies that if a path exists, it will be found by the system. My role is to provide valid end-points for `conf`.
           
           **Let's try a very conservative approach for configurations:**
           
           **Communication Configuration (#o0 for both rovers to lander v9):**
           - Lander `v9` AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
           - To be outside `v9`'s bounding box and avoid `v20`:
               - Let's try `x = -1.0` (outside `v20`)
               - For `y`, `v9`'s upper y is -1.654. Let's go significantly above it. Say, `y = -1.0`.
           - So, `#o0` = `(-1.0, -1.0)`.
               - This was previously marked as "not reachable for robot base" for both rovers. This is odd. `v14` is at (-1.0, -1.75). Moving from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-1.0, -1.0)` is a straight, short move. This suggests more complex reachability rules or hidden obstacles.
           
           Given the consistent "not reachable" messages even for short distances without apparent obstacles, I need to rethink. Could it be that `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` *already have fixed values* and are simply represented as `#` because they are parameters? The initial state shows `conf(v14, #o0)`, `conf(v14, #o3)`, `conf(v12, #o0)`, `conf(v12, #o3)`, `conf(v12, #o5)`, `conf(v14, #o5)`. This means these `#` objects *are* configurations. The system is expecting me to provide values for them.
           
           If simple, short moves are "not reachable," then the issue isn't my chosen coordinates, but that the initial state might not allow for *any* moves to these configurations for some reason, or the "robot base" has significant size.
           
           **Let's try to infer from the existing continuous objects:**
           - `v13` (1.0, -1.75) is `conf` for `v12`.
           - `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) is `conf` for `v14`.
           
           **What if the "not reachable" for `(-1.0, -1.0)` is because it's too far from the `motion` parameters?**
           The `motion` predicates are like `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o0)`, `motion(v12, #o0, #o2, v13)`. These imply that `v13` and `#o0` are mutually reachable for `v12` via a trajectory `#o2`. Same for `v14` and `#o0` with `v15`.
           So, if `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o0)` is in the initial state, then `v13` (1.0, -1.75) and `#o0` *must* be mutually reachable.
           This means that my chosen value for `#o0` `(-1.0, -1.0)` should be considered reachable *if it is collision free*. The "not reachable" error then might imply a collision, even if I calculate it as non-colliding with `v9` and `v20`.
           
           Let's assume the provided motion predicates are the *only* allowed paths for the rover.
           This means:
           - `v12` can move between `v13`, `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`.
           - `v14` can move between `v15`, `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`.
           
           This implies there's *one* `#o0`, *one* `#o3`, *one* `#o5` that *all* satisfy the motion predicates and other conditions.
           
           Given the AABB of `v20` is `((-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), (0.05, 2.5, 0.1))`, any configuration with x between -0.05 and 0.05 will collide. So x must be outside this range.
           
           **New Strategy: Extreme Coordinates for Collision Avoidance.**
           To guarantee being outside `v20` and `v9`, let's choose coordinates that are clearly far from them, but still plausible for the `comrange` and `imagerange`.
           
           **Communication Configuration (#o0):**
           - Lander `v9` AABB: `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
           - `v20` AABB: `((-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), (0.05, 2.5, 0.1))`.
           - Let's try `#o0` at `(-2.0, -1.0)`.
               - `x=-2.0` is outside `v20`'s x-range.
               - `y=-1.0` is above `v9`'s upper y (-1.654) and outside `v9`'s x-range (minx=-2.405, maxx=-1.395). `x=-2.0` is within `v9`'s x-range. This still collides!
               - So, we need x to be outside `v9`'s x-range. E.g., `x = -2.5` or `x = -1.3`.
               - Let's try `#o0` at `(-2.5, -2.0)`. This point is outside `v9`'s AABB. (`x=-2.5` < `v9.minx=-2.405`).
                   - `v14` (-1.0, -1.75) to (-2.5, -2.0): Distance = `sqrt((-2.5 - (-1.0))^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.75))^2)` = `sqrt((-1.5)^2 + (-0.25)^2)` = `sqrt(2.25 + 0.0625)` = `sqrt(2.3125)` ~ 1.5. This seems reachable.
                   - `v12` (1.0, -1.75) to (-2.5, -2.0): Distance = `sqrt((-2.5 - 1.0)^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.75))^2)` = `sqrt((-3.5)^2 + (-0.25)^2)` = `sqrt(12.25 + 0.0625)` = `sqrt(12.3125)` ~ 3.5. This involves crossing `v20` (x=0). If it's reachable according to `motion` predicates, then it should work.
           
           **Image Configuration (#o3):**
           - Objectives `v17` (2.1, 1.8), `v18` (-1.9, 2.0), `v19` (0.5, 1.9).
           - `v20` (wall at x=0).
           - Rover `v14` starts at (-1.0, -1.75).
           - Given the `imagerange` is 2, and objects are spread, the single `#o3` must be able to see them all. This is impossible without a larger range, or if the `imagevisible` function itself has a more complex geometric model.
           - Let's pick `#o3` at a very safe x coordinate, far from `v20`. Say `x=1.0`. For y, let's try `y=1.0`. So, `#o3` = `(1.0, 1.0)`.
               - `v14` (-1.0, -1.75) to (1.0, 1.0): Dist = `sqrt((1.0 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.0 - (-1.75))^2)` = `sqrt(2^2 + 2.75^2)` = `sqrt(4 + 7.5625)` = `sqrt(11.5625)` ~ 3.4. This needs to cross `v20`.
               - Collisions: (1.0, 1.0) avoids `v20` and `v9`.
               - Visibility check (Range 2):
                   - `v17` (2.1, 1.8): `sqrt((2.1-1.0)^2 + (1.8-1.0)^2)` = `sqrt(1.1^2 + 0.8^2)` = `sqrt(1.21 + 0.64)` = `sqrt(1.85)` < 2. OK for `v17`.
                   - `v18` (-1.9, 2.0): `sqrt((-1.9-1.0)^2 + (2.0-1.0)^2)` = `sqrt((-2.9)^2 + 1.0^2)` = `sqrt(8.41 + 1)` = `sqrt(9.41)` > 2. Fails for `v18`.
                   - `v19` (0.5, 1.9): `sqrt((0.5-1.0)^2 + (1.9-1.0)^2)` = `sqrt((-0.5)^2 + 0.9^2)` = `sqrt(0.25 + 0.81)` = `sqrt(1.06)` < 2. OK for `v19`.
           - Still a problem with `v18`. This strongly implies the system expects `imagerange` to be *effectively* larger, despite the problem text.
           
           I have to assume the `imagevisible` predicate is guaranteed true if the rover is at `#o3`, regardless of my manual range calculation if such an `#o3` exists and is collision-free. I will prioritize collision-free and reachability.
           
           Let's try `#o3` at `(0.5, 1.5)`. This is right of `v20`.
           - `v14` starts at (-1.0, -1.75) to (0.5, 1.5): involves crossing `v20`. Assumed reachable via `motion`.
           
           **Sampling Configuration (#o5):**
           - `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           - Rocks: `v3` (type `v2`) at ((2.044, -1.798), (2.147, -1.695)). `v5` (type `v6`) at ((1.587, -1.105), (1.717, -0.975)).
           - We need `#o5` to be above both.
           - Let's try `#o5` at `(1.8, -1.5)`. This was previously "not reachable". This is extremely suspicious as `v12` is at (1.0, -1.75) and (1.8, -1.5) is very close.
           - Perhaps the "not reachable" applies to the specific `motion` action given? `motion(v12, #o5, #o2, v13)` implies `v13` and `#o5` are reachable.
           - What if `#o5` is simply the location of one of the rocks? For example, the center of `v3`? (2.09, -1.74). This should be "above" it for sampling.
           - Let's try `#o5` at `(2.1, -1.7)`. This is the center of `v3`. This is reachable from `v13` (1.0, -1.75). No collision with `v20` or `v9`.
           
           **Final attempt with specific coordinates, assuming `motion` predicates allow crossing `v20` and my geometric understanding for `above` and `visible` is secondary to what the problem allows:**
           
           - `#o3` for `v14` for `v17`, `v18`, `v19`: `(0.5, 1.5)` (right of `v20`, generally central to targets).
           - `#o0` for `v14` and `v12` for `v9`: `(-2.5, -2.0)` (far left of `v9`, collision-free with `v9` and `v20`).
           - `#o5` for `v12` for `v3`, `v5`: `(2.1, -1.7)` (Center of `v3`, implicitly "above" `v3` and hopefully `v5`).

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(v_stone)` for rocks of type `v2` (stone), and `receivedanalysis(v_soil)` for rocks of type `v6` (soil).
           
           Rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75), and rover `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). Both rovers have camera `v10` which supports mode `v11`. Both rovers have free storage `v16`. Lander `v9` is available for communication.
           
           Image Objectives: `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           Rock types: `v2` (stone), `v6` (soil).
           Specific rocks: `v1`, `v3`, `v4` are type `v2`. `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are type `v6`.
           
           The continuous parameter guessing is consistently failing due to collisions and reachability issues, even for short, seemingly unhindered movements. This suggests a misunderstanding of the environment's geometry or the robot's movement capabilities.
           
           Let's summarize the new obstacle `v21`:
           - `v20`: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1)) - wall at x=0.
           - `v9`: AABB(lower=[-2.4047, -2.3455502384913305, 0.0], upper=[-1.3952999999999998, -1.6544497615086693, 0.40766007847975994]) - the lander.
           - `v21`: AABB(lower=(-2.55, -2.55, 0.0), upper=(-2.45, 2.55, 0.1)) - a wall at x=-2.5.
           
           My previous choice for `#o0` `(-2.5, -2.0)` collided with `v21` (x=-2.5 wall) AND `v9`. This explains why it was a bad choice.
           
           The key must be that the provided `motion` predicates for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` imply specific, existing values for these continuous parameters, and I need to find them. The "not reachable" errors even for minor position changes are extremely puzzling if these are standard Cartesian coordinates.
           
           Since direct guessing of coordinates is failing, and the problem explicitly states "Any object that starts with a '#' represents a *continuous parameter* (e.g., a trajectory, or a pose) that has not yet been computed... If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration...". This means I *must* provide these values, even if my attempts are failing.
           
           I am forced to assume that the set of configurations (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`) have very specific "magic" values that work and are compatible with all given `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, `above`, and `motion` predicates.
           
           Given the new `v21` obstacle (wall at x=-2.5), I need to choose `#o0` to be outside of it.
           If I can't place `#o0` at x=-2.5, then it must be something like `x=-2.4` (right of `v21`) or `x=-2.6` (left of `v21`).
           Also, `v9` (lander) is between x=-2.4047 and x=-1.39529.
           If I set `#o0` to `x=-1.0`, this is within `v9`'s x-range. So this will collide.
           
           This means `v9` and `v21` heavily restrict `#o0`.
           - To avoid `v21` (x=-2.5 wall), `#o0.x` must not be in `(-2.55, -2.45)`.
           - To avoid `v9` (x-range: -2.4047 to -1.39529), `#o0.x` must not be in this range.
           - So, `#o0.x` must be `< -2.55` or `> -1.39529`.
           
           **Let's try to place #o0 outside of the x-range of both `v9` and `v21`:**
           - To be to the left of `v21`: `x < -2.55`. Let's try `x = -2.6`.
           - To be to the right of `v9`: `x > -1.39529`. Let's try `x = -1.3`.
           
           Let's try `#o0` = `(-1.3, -1.0)`.
           - This is `x=-1.3`. It's outside `v21`'s x-range. It's to the right of `v9`'s x-range (so no x-collision).
           - For `y`, `v9`'s upper y is -1.654. `y=-1.0` is above it, so no y-collision with `v9`.
           - This position `(-1.3, -1.0)` is collision-free with `v9` and `v21`. It is also collision-free with `v20`.
           - `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). Moving to `(-1.3, -1.0)`: short distance, no wall crossing. Should be reachable.
           - `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). Moving to `(-1.3, -1.0)`: longer distance, crosses `v20`. Assuming `motion` predicate handles this.
           
           **Image Configuration (#o3):**
           - Objectives `v17` (2.1, 1.8), `v18` (-1.9, 2.0), `v19` (0.5, 1.9).
           - `v20` (wall at x=0). `v21` (wall at x=-2.5).
           - My previous attempts were rejected as "not reachable". This could be related to the starting position of `v14` (-1.0, -1.75) and the wall `v20`.
           - Let's try `#o3` at `(-1.0, 1.0)`. This is on the left side of `v20` and far from `v21`.
               - `v14` from (-1.0, -1.75) to (-1.0, 1.0): This is a straight path upwards. Should be reachable. No collision.
               - As discussed before, with `imagerange=2`, this point won't see all three objectives. But if `imagevisible` is given, I must assume it works.
           
           **Sampling Configuration (#o5):**
           - `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           - Rocks: `v3` (type `v2`) at ((2.044, -1.798), (2.147, -1.695)). `v5` (type `v6`) at ((1.587, -1.105), (1.717, -0.975)).
           - My previous `(2.1, -1.7)` (center of `v3`) was "not reachable". This is very close to `v12`'s start `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           - Let's try to put `#o5` even closer to `v12`'s start, or slightly modified.
           - Try `#o5` at `(1.2, -1.5)`. This is very close to `v13`. It avoids walls. It's plausible to be "above" `v5` (at 1.6, -1.0) and `v3` (at 2.1, -1.7).
               - `v12` from (1.0, -1.75) to (1.2, -1.5): A short diagonal move. Should be reachable.

           It is evident that the continuous parameter suggestions I'm providing are consistently being rejected as "not reachable for robot base." This is highly unusual for the types of coordinates I am providing, especially for short distances or seemingly clear paths. The problem is not with collision with specific objects like walls, but the generic reachability for the robot base. This suggests one of two scenarios:
           1.  There are unknown, unstated obstacles or terrain features that make even simple movements impossible.
           2.  The "reachability" condition is tied to something much more specific, perhaps implicitly defined by the existing motion predicates, and I am not correctly interpreting how new configuration values relate to these.
           3.  The problem has an inherent contradiction, and no such reachable configurations exist given the robot's capabilities and environment.
           
           Given that I am required to provide a plan if the goal is achievable, and the `motion` predicates in the initial state like `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o0)`, `motion(v12, #o0, #o2, #o0)`, `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)`, `motion(v12, #o3, #o2, #o0)`, `motion(v12, #o5, #o2, #o0)`, etc., exist, this implies that:
           *   There are valid and reachable continuous values for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` for both rovers from their respective initial configurations (`v13` for `v12`, `v15` for `v14`).
           *   The system *must* have a way to compute the specific trajectory (`#o2`) between these points if I provide valid endpoints.
           
           The repeated "not reachable" for all chosen configurations means my chosen (x,y) coordinates for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` are fundamentally incompatible with the robot's actual movement capabilities or unstated environment constraints.
           
           Since I cannot infer the specific reachable coordinates, and my attempts to place them logically are failing, the only remaining option (if a solution is possible) is if the `motion` predicates imply that some (x,y) coordinates *other than what I have provided* are inherently baked into `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` which the system validates. But I am *required* to provide the (x,y) values for '#'.
           
           There are no more "logical" choices to make for coordinates that would be "more reachable" without more information. Trying slightly different numbers is just guessing.
           
           Given this impasse, and the repeated "not reachable" error across all configurations (even for very small, collision-free movements from the starting points), it's highly probable that:
           1.  The problem has an inherent unstated constraint that makes *any* movement to a continuous configuration (even a tiny one) "not reachable".
           2.  The specific continuous values for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are expected to be *very specific* values known only to the validation system, and not inferable from the given AABBs and predicates alone.
           
           I must provide a plan if achievable. I cannot determine coordinates that satisfy the "reachable" criteria based on the information given and feedback received.
           
           I will make a final attempt to provide the plan with *placeholder* coordinates. If these are still rejected, I must conclude that the problem is unsolvable under the current conditions, or the method of determining these continuous values is beyond what can be inferred from the PDDL and AABB information.
           
           Let's use the current coordinates of the rovers, `v13` (1.0, -1.75) and `v15` (-1.0, -1.75), and try to modify them minimally to be valid configurations. This is unlikely to work given the "not reachable" on even short moves, but is the last logical step.
           
           If `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75), maybe `#o3` could be `v15` itself? But then it won't be visible to objectives.
           The "not reachable" means the given objects starting with '#' cannot be assigned a value that allows the rover to move to it.
           
           Given the task implies that the goal is achievable and I must provide a plan, this is an impossible situation. I have tried several reasonable sets of continuous parameters based on geometric intuition, collision avoidance, and range limits, but all are rejected for reachability.
           
           Therefore, I must conclude that the specific values for the continuous parameters cannot be determined from the available information or are highly constrained by unstated factors, making the task practically unachievable by inferring the coordinates. Without a working set of configurations, the plan cannot be executed.
           
           Since I am instructed to return a plan only if it is achievable, and I cannot find a set of reachable configurations, I will state that the goal is not achievable under the current information provided.
           The repeated "not reachable for robot base" for all tried configurations for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`, regardless of how close they are to the starting positions or how clear the path seems, indicates that these configurations are inherently impossible to reach or there are critical unstated constraints on robot movement. For example, `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) cannot reach `(-1.0, 1.0)` (straight up) or `(-1.3, -1.0)` (short diagonal). Similarly for `v12`. This contradicts the very nature of robot movement in a grid-like or continuous space.
           
           The only way a solution could exist is if the initial state contains the *exact* (x,y) values for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` implicitly, and my task is simply to select *them* from a list of valid actions. But I'm asked to *provide* the values.
           
           I cannot provide a plan with valid configurations given the repeated feedback.
           
           The goal is not achievable from the initial state because all attempts to define collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable continuous configurations for image taking, communication, and sampling have failed due to "not reachable for robot base" errors, even for minimal movements or seemingly clear paths. This indicates an fundamental issue with the environment or robot movement model that cannot be overcome with the available information.
