           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom representing a complex set of conditions including `receivedimage` for objectives `v17`, `v18`, `v19` with mode `v11`, and `receivedanalysis` for rocks `?stone` and `?soil` of types `v2` and `v6` respectively, as well as `atconf` for both rovers `v12` and `v14` at their respective configurations and `free` stores for both rovers.
           
           Let's break down the goal:
           1. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This means images of objectives `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` need to be taken and sent to the lander `v9` with mode `v11`.
           2. `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` where `type(?stone, v2)` and `type(?soil, v6)`: This means rocks of type `v2` and `v6` need to be sampled and their analysis sent to the lander `v9`.
           3. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           4. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: These are also already true in the initial state.
           
           Since the `atconf` and `free` conditions are already met, we need to focus on taking and sending images and sampling and sending analysis.
           
           First, let's address the image requirements:
           - `v17`: objective, AABB = ((2.042, 1.755), (2.141, 1.853))
           - `v18`: objective, AABB = ((-1.947, 2.046), (-1.857, 2.136))
           - `v19`: objective, AABB = ((0.434, 1.864), (0.533, 1.963))
           
           Rovers `v12` (at `v13` (1.0, -1.75, 3.142)) and `v14` (at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)) both have `v10` as a camera which supports `v11` mode.
           Both rovers can image `v17`, `v18`, `v19` from configuration `#o3` using ray `#o4`.
           Both rovers can communicate with `v9` from configuration `#o0` using ray `#o1`.
           
           Let's pick rover `v14` (at `v15`) for imaging `v17`, `v18`, `v19` and sending them.
           Rover `v14` at `v15` has camera `v10` which supports mode `v11`.
           `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)` are true.
           So, we need to:
           1. Calibrate `v10` for `v14` at `#o3` for each objective.
           2. Take image for `v17`, `v18`, `v19` with `v10` and `v11`.
           3. Send image for `v17`, `v18`, `v19` to `v9` via `#o0` and `#o1`.
           
           Next, the analysis requirements:
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: `v1`, `v3`, `v4` are rocks of type `v2`.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are rocks of type `v6`.
           
           Rover `v14` at `v15` is `above` `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           Store `v16` is `free` for `v14`.
           Let's pick `v4` (type `v2`) and `v8` (type `v6`) to sample and send analysis for.
           
           So, we need to:
           1. Sample `v4` (type `v2`) at `#o5`.
           2. Sample `v8` (type `v6`) at `#o5`.
           3. Send analysis for `v4` and `v8` to `v9` via `#o0` and `#o1`.
           
           Let's try to plan using `v14` for all tasks, staying at `v15` if possible, and then moving to the required continuous configurations.
           The only allowed moves are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`, which essentially means the rovers are already in their desired 'base' locations. So, we'll assume the continuous configurations (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`) are reachable from `v15` for `v14` and `v13` for `v12`.
           
           Let's prioritize `v14` since it is initially at `v15` and `atconf(v14, v15)` is true.
           
           Plan steps:
           1. Move `v14` to `#o3` (implicitly handled by the `calibrate` and `take_image` actions as a continuous parameter, assuming `#o3` is a valid viewing pose for all objectives).
           2. Calibrate camera `v10` for `v14` at `#o3` for `v17`.
           3. Take image of `v17` using `v10` in `v11` mode.
           4. Calibrate camera `v10` for `v14` at `#o3` for `v18`.
           5. Take image of `v18` using `v10` in `v11` mode.
           6. Calibrate camera `v10` for `v14` at `#o3` for `v19`.
           7. Take image of `v19` using `v10` in `v11` mode.
           8. Move `v14` to `#o0` (implicitly handled by `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, assuming `#o0` is a valid communication pose for `v9`).
           9. Send image of `v17` to `v9`.
           10. Send image of `v18` to `v9`.
           11. Send image of `v19` to `v9`.
           12. Move `v14` to `#o5` (implicitly handled by `sample_rock` actions, assuming `#o5` is a valid sampling pose for all rocks).
           13. Sample `v4` (type `v2`) using `v16` store.
           14. Drop `v4` to make `v16` free for the next sample.
           15. Sample `v8` (type `v6`) using `v16` store.
           16. Move `v14` to `#o0`.
           17. Send analysis of `v4` to `v9`.
           18. Send analysis of `v8` to `v9`.
           
           Wait, the plan asks for `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for a *given* stone. If I drop it, I lose the analysis data. I need to send the analysis *before* dropping, or use separate stores. Since there's only one store `v16` and the goal states `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` *at the end*, I have to sample, send analysis, then drop.
           
           Revised Plan steps:
           1. Calibrate camera `v10` for `v14` at `#o3` for `v17`.
           2. Take image of `v17` using `v10` in `v11` mode.
           3. Calibrate camera `v10` for `v14` at `#o3` for `v18`.
           4. Take image of `v18` using `v10` in `v11` mode.
           5. Calibrate camera `v10` for `v14` at `#o3` for `v19`.
           6. Take image of `v19` using `v10` in `v11` mode.
           7. Send image of `v17` to `v9` from `#o0`.
           8. Send image of `v18` to `v9` from `#o0`.
           9. Send image of `v19` to `v9` from `#o0`.
           10. Sample `v4` (type `v2`) using `v16` store at `#o5`.
           11. Send analysis of `v4` to `v9` from `#o0`.
           12. Drop `v4` from `v16`.
           13. Sample `v8` (type `v6`) using `v16` store at `#o5`.
           14. Send analysis of `v8` to `v9` from `#o0`.
           15. Drop `v8` from `v16`.
           
           The `move` actions for continuous parameters are not explicitly in the action list, but are implied by the continuous values given for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` and the `atconf` requirements for those actions. I will only list the core actions.
           
           The objects `v1`, `v3`, `v4` are type `v2`. Let's pick `v4`.
           The objects `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are type `v6`. Let's pick `v8`.
           
           The `atconf` predicates for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` will need to be satisfied implicitly by the continuous parameter solver.
           The `blocked` predicate for `#o1` and `#o4` must be false. This is ensured if `cfreerayconf` is true.
           
           Let's assume the rover `v14` is initially at `v15`. For actions like `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`, the `atconf` precondition must be met. The problem statement says "Any object that starts with a '#' represents a continuous parameter... If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state... then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration". This means that the robot needs to be at that configuration. Since there are no explicit `move` actions to move to `#o0`, `#o3`, or `#o5`, the continuous planner will generate valid configurations for these. The initial state already provides `conf(v14, #o0)`, `conf(v14, #o3)`, `conf(v14, #o5)`, and `conf(v12, #o0)`, `conf(v12, #o3)`, `conf(v12, #o5)`.
           
           I will use rover `v14`. Its initial location is `v15`. The available actions only allow `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`, which means the robot effectively stays at `v15` and the continuous configurations are relative to `v15`.
           
           Let's calculate the continuous values.
           - `#o3`: For `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)`.
             - `v14` (robot), `v17` (objective), `v18` (objective), `v19` (objective).
             - Rover `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
             - `v17`: ((2.042, 1.755), (2.141, 1.853)) - too far if the rover is at (-1.0, -1.75). The maximum distance for imagevisible is 2.
             - `v18`: ((-1.947, 2.046), (-1.857, 2.136)) - This is relatively close to `v14` at `v15`.
             - `v19`: ((0.434, 1.864), (0.533, 1.963)) - This is also relatively close to `v14` at `v15`.
             The coordinates for `v17` are too far from `v15`. `dist(v15, center(v17)) = sqrt(( (2.042+2.141)/2 - (-1.0) )^2 + ( (1.755+1.853)/2 - (-1.75) )^2 ) = sqrt((2.0915+1)^2 + (1.804+1.75)^2) = sqrt(3.0915^2 + 3.554^2) = sqrt(9.557 + 12.631) = sqrt(22.188) approx 4.7`. This is greater than 2.
             So, `v17` cannot be imaged by `v14` from `v15` or any configuration within 2 units.
             Similarly, for `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75, 3.142), `dist(v13, center(v17)) = sqrt( ((2.042+2.141)/2 - 1.0)^2 + ((1.755+1.853)/2 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(1.0915^2 + 3.554^2) = sqrt(1.19 + 12.63) = sqrt(13.82) approx 3.7`. Still too far.
           
           It seems `v17` cannot be imaged by either rover from their initial locations or from `#o3` given the distance constraints. If `v17` cannot be imaged, then `receivedimage(v17, v11)` cannot be achieved, and the goal `new-axiom@0()` (which requires `receivedimage(v17, v11)`) is unachievable.
           
           Let me double check the `imagerange` predicate. The initial state shows `imagerange(v14, #o3, v17)`, `imagerange(v12, #o3, v17)`. This implies that `v17` *is* within imaging range for both rovers from configuration `#o3`. This contradicts my manual distance calculation, so I should trust the provided initial state. The problem implies that a valid configuration `#o3` exists and `imagevisible` is true.
           
           Given the existing facts like `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, it means a valid configuration `#o3` exists that allows `v14` to see `v17`, `v18`, `v19`. I will rely on this and compute positions for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` as requested.
           
           Let's assume the continuous planner will find these configurations for me.
           The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which requires `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for type `v2` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for type `v6`. And that `v12` and `v14` are at their initial `atconf` and their stores are `free`.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`:
           We need `take_image` and `send_image`.
           `take_image` requires `calibrated`, `onboard`, `supports`, `atconf`, `imagevisible`, `~blocked`.
           `send_image` requires `haveimage`, `comvisible`, `atconf`, `~blocked`.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis`:
           We need `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`.
           `sample_rock` requires `above`, `store`, `atconf`, `free`.
           `send_analysis` requires `analyzed`, `comvisible`, `atconf`, `~blocked`.
           
           Let's use `v14` for all operations as it's at `v15` initially.
           1. Calibrate `v10` for `v14` from `#o3` towards `v17`.
           2. Take image of `v17` with `v10` and `v11`.
           3. Calibrate `v10` for `v14` from `#o3` towards `v18`. (Note: Calibrating for one objective does not necessarily calibrate for another if the viewing geometry is different, so we calibrate each time. The problem statement says `calibrated(?c, ?v)` not `calibrated(?c, ?v, ?o)`).
           4. Take image of `v18` with `v10` and `v11`.
           5. Calibrate `v10` for `v14` from `#o3` towards `v19`.
           6. Take image of `v19` with `v10` and `v11`.
           7. Send images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19` to `v9` from `#o0`.
           8. Sample rock `v4` (type `v2`) with `v14` from `#o5` into `v16`.
           9. Send analysis of `v4` to `v9` from `#o0`.
           10. Drop rock `v4` from `v16` to free up the store.
           11. Sample rock `v8` (type `v6`) with `v14` from `#o5` into `v16`.
           12. Send analysis of `v8` to `v9` from `#o0`.
           13. Drop rock `v8` from `v16` to free up the store.
           
           This plan uses the continuous configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`. I will provide a position for each used configuration.
           For `#o3` for `v14`: to image `v17`, `v18`, `v19`. I need to pick a single pose that can see all three, or assume the continuous planner chooses a pose per target. Since the predicate `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` implies `#o3` is a valid pose for `v14` to see `v17`, I will pick one such pose for `#o3` that is within range. I'll pick a central point between `v18` and `v19` for `#o3` and assume the initial state indicates `v17` is also visible.
           - `v18`: ((-1.947, 2.046), (-1.857, 2.136)), center: (-1.902, 2.091)
           - `v19`: ((0.434, 1.864), (0.533, 1.963)), center: (0.4835, 1.9135)
           - `v17`: ((2.042, 1.755), (2.141, 1.853)), center: (2.0915, 1.804)
           
           Let's pick `#o3` at a pose that tries to see `v18` and `v19`. For `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). A point like (0.0, 0.0) could be reasonable as an intermediate pose. However, the initial state gives `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` etc. This means `#o3` is specific to seeing `v18`, `v19`, `v17` for `v14`. I'll pick a single representative continuous value for `#o3` for `v14` to satisfy `imagevisible` for all relevant objectives.
           Rover `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). The objectives are in positive Y.
           Let's choose `x` for `#o3` around `0.0` and `y` around `1.0`. For a target `v18` at (-1.902, 2.091) and `v19` at (0.4835, 1.9135). A point like (0.0, 1.0) is within 2 units for both.
           `dist( (0.0, 1.0), (-1.902, 2.091) ) = sqrt( (0 - (-1.902))^2 + (1 - 2.091)^2 ) = sqrt(1.902^2 + (-1.091)^2) = sqrt(3.617 + 1.190) = sqrt(4.807) approx 2.19`. This is over 2.
           Maybe the configuration `#o3` should be closer to the targets than `v15`.
           Let's try ( -0.7, 1.5 ).
           `dist( (-0.7, 1.5), (-1.902, 2.091) ) = sqrt( (-0.7 - (-1.902))^2 + (1.5 - 2.091)^2 ) = sqrt(1.202^2 + (-0.591)^2) = sqrt(1.444 + 0.349) = sqrt(1.793) approx 1.34`. Good.
           `dist( (-0.7, 1.5), (0.4835, 1.9135) ) = sqrt( (-0.7 - 0.4835)^2 + (1.5 - 1.9135)^2 ) = sqrt((-1.1835)^2 + (-0.4135)^2) = sqrt(1.401 + 0.171) = sqrt(1.572) approx 1.25`. Good.
           `dist( (-0.7, 1.5), (2.0915, 1.804) ) = sqrt( (-0.7 - 2.0915)^2 + (1.5 - 1.804)^2 ) = sqrt((-2.7915)^2 + (-0.304)^2) = sqrt(7.792 + 0.092) = sqrt(7.884) approx 2.8`. This is still too far.
           
           This means that `#o3` is not a single configuration for all three objectives `v17`, `v18`, `v19`. It implies that there are distinct configurations for each `(v14, #o3, #o4, <objective>)` fact.
           Since the action schema uses a single `#o3` for `take_image` and `calibrate`, it must refer to a single physical location.
           Given that the initial state contains `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)`, this means there *exists* a single configuration `#o3` that can see all three objects. I must trust this. I will assume (0.5, 1.0) is a valid point.
           `dist( (0.5, 1.0), (-1.902, 2.091) ) = sqrt( (0.5 - (-1.902))^2 + (1.0 - 2.091)^2 ) = sqrt(2.402^2 + (-1.091)^2) = sqrt(5.77 + 1.19) = sqrt(6.96) approx 2.6`. Still too far for some targets.
           
           This is a tricky part. I have to provide one continuous value for `#o3`. However, `imagevisible` is true for multiple targets. It seems the problem implicitly assumes a single pose `#o3` for imaging is sufficient for all `v17`, `v18`, `v19` if they are all listed with the same `#o3`.
           
           Given the distance constraints, and the objects `v17`, `v18`, `v19` being quite spread out, it is highly unlikely one single configuration `#o3` can see all three within 2 units.
           However, if the initial state explicitly says `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)`, then I must assume such a configuration `#o3` exists.
           I will pick a coordinate for `#o3` that represents a pose that can see all three, e.g., an averaged center.
           `x_avg = (-1.902 + 0.4835 + 2.0915) / 3 = 0.2243`
           `y_avg = (2.091 + 1.9135 + 1.804) / 3 = 1.936`
           So, let's try (0.224, 1.936).
           Distance from (0.224, 1.936) to `v17` center (2.0915, 1.804): `sqrt((2.0915-0.224)^2 + (1.804-1.936)^2) = sqrt(1.8675^2 + (-0.132)^2) = sqrt(3.487 + 0.017) = sqrt(3.504) approx 1.87`. This is good.
           Distance from (0.224, 1.936) to `v18` center (-1.902, 2.091): `sqrt((-1.902-0.224)^2 + (2.091-1.936)^2) = sqrt((-2.126)^2 + 0.155^2) = sqrt(4.519 + 0.024) = sqrt(4.543) approx 2.13`. This is slightly over 2.
           
           The problem specifically says "maximum distance from the rover to the target is 2 for `imagevisible`". If a target is slightly over 2, then `imagevisible` would be false. This suggests that the continuous values for `#o3` for `v14` to see `v17`, `v18`, `v19` might not be a single configuration. However, the PDDL uses `#o3` for all. I will assume the provided `imagevisible` predicates are true and the continuous planner will find a valid pose for `#o3` which, according to the problem setup, should be a single pose if the same variable is used. This is a contradiction.
           
           Given the constraints, I will proceed by selecting specific configurations for each (rover, target) pair where a continuous variable is used for configuration, even if the PDDL syntax implies a single `#o3`. If this is incorrect and the continuous parameters must refer to the same physical location when the variable name is the same, the problem becomes unsolvable from the given information.
           
           Let's assume the question implicitly implies that `#o3` *for v14 and v17* is different from `#o3` *for v14 and v18*, despite using the same symbol `#o3` in the initial state fact `imagevisible`. This is a common PDDL shorthand to mean "a valid pose for this observation." So I will define `#o3` for `v14` to see `v17`, a different `#o3'` for `v14` to see `v18`, and so on. But the provided action list doesn't show this. It shows `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`. This means the planner expects one configuration named `#o3`.
           
           Let's pick a configuration that makes at least one image visible, and hope the system handles it. The point (0.224, 1.936) works for v17.
           If `v17` is the only one visible, the goal can't be achieved. This is a critical point.
           
           Re-evaluating the prompt: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration such that, given the geometry of the scene, the configuration is collision-free for the rover, reachable from the rover's current configuration, and has occlusion-free line-of-sight to the target object in the fourth argument in the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate. The third argument to the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate is the ray from the configuration to the target object. ... If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name."
           
           This clarifies: I *must* provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair. So I will have to define `#o3` for (v14, v17), `#o3` for (v14, v18), and `#o3` for (v14, v19). But the PDDL action `take_image(?v: object, ?q: object, ?y: object, ?o: object, ?c: object, ?m: object)` only accepts one `?q`. This implies that each `take_image` action will need a specific continuous config.
           So, the plan would look like:
           `(calibrate v14 #o3-v17 #o4-v17 v17 v10)`
           `(take_image v14 #o3-v17 #o4-v17 v17 v10 v11)`
           etc.
           However, the initial state is given with `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, meaning the variable names `#o3` and `#o4` are common for all the facts. This is highly confusing.
           
           Given the rigid action instances list and the initial state, I must assume that the single `#o3` in the PDDL facts means that ONE single continuous configuration named `#o3` exists which satisfies all the `imagevisible` predicates that use it. Same for `#o0` and `#o5`. If this leads to geometric impossibility, then the problem is unsolvable.
           
           Let's try to find such a point for `#o3` for `v14`. Given the centers:
           `v17`: (2.0915, 1.804)
           `v18`: (-1.902, 2.091)
           `v19`: (0.4835, 1.9135)
           
           The average of these is (0.224, 1.936).
           Max distance to any of these targets from this average point: `v18` is `2.13`. This is greater than 2.
           So no single point `q` exists such that `dist(q, target_center) <= 2` for all three targets.
           This implies that the goal is NOT achievable, because at least one `take_image` action for `v17`, `v18`, or `v19` cannot have its `imagevisible` precondition satisfied if `#o3` is a single pose.
           
           Let's re-read the axiom.
           `Axiom new-axiom@0() Conjunction Atom atconf(v12, v13) Atom atconf(v14, v15) Atom free(v12, v16) Atom free(v14, v16) Atom receivedimage(v17, v11) Atom receivedimage(v18, v11) Atom receivedimage(v19, v11) Atom type(?stone, v2) Atom receivedanalysis(?stone) Atom type(?soil, v6) Atom receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           If `receivedimage(v17, v11)` is unreachable, then the whole goal is unreachable.
           Based on geometry, it is impossible to find a single pose `#o3` that allows `v14` to image all `v17`, `v18`, `v19` simultaneously given the range constraint of 2.0. The same applies to `v12`.
           
           Perhaps the problem implies that the continuous value for `#o3` can change for each action?
           "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') ... then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration ... If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name."
           
           This strongly suggests that even if the PDDL shows `#o3` as the variable, I should interpret it as a distinct continuous configuration for each specific (rover, target) combination. So, for `take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11`, the `#o3` here is specific to (v14, v17), and when I define the continuous values, I should give `(#o3 v14 v17): (x, y)`.
           
           Okay, this interpretation makes the problem solvable. I will proceed with this.
           
           I'll define specific configurations for each `(rover, target)` pair used in the plan.
           For `v14` imaging:
           - `#o3-v17`: `v14` to `v17`. `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). `v17` at (2.0915, 1.804).
             - Let's pick a point for `v14` for `v17`. Rover `v14` at `v15` is (-1.0, -1.75). `v17` is far.
             - The problem states `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`. This must mean such a config exists, despite my calculations. This means I need to rely on the problem's implicit guarantee that such values are found. I will pick a point that satisfies the geometric constraints *if* such a point is discoverable.
             - I'll put `#o3` for `v14` and `v17` at `(1.0, 1.0)`. `dist((1.0, 1.0), (2.0915, 1.804)) = sqrt((2.0915-1.0)^2 + (1.804-1.0)^2) = sqrt(1.0915^2 + 0.804^2) = sqrt(1.191 + 0.646) = sqrt(1.837) approx 1.35`. Good.
           - `#o3-v18`: `v14` to `v18`. `v18` at (-1.902, 2.091).
             - Let's try `(-1.0, 1.0)`. `dist((-1.0, 1.0), (-1.902, 2.091)) = sqrt((-1.902 - (-1.0))^2 + (2.091 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt((-0.902)^2 + 1.091^2) = sqrt(0.814 + 1.190) = sqrt(2.004) approx 1.41`. Good.
           - `#o3-v19`: `v14` to `v19`. `v19` at (0.4835, 1.9135).
             - Let's try `(0.0, 1.0)`. `dist((0.0, 1.0), (0.4835, 1.9135)) = sqrt((0.4835 - 0.0)^2 + (1.9135 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.4835^2 + 0.9135^2) = sqrt(0.234 + 0.834) = sqrt(1.068) approx 1.03`. Good.
           
           For `v14` communicating with `v9`:
           - `#o0-v9`: `v14` to `v9`. `v9` is at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)), center (-1.9, -2.0).
             - `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
             - Let's try `(-1.5, -2.0)`. `dist((-1.5, -2.0), (-1.9, -2.0)) = sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.5))^2 + (-2.0 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt((-0.4)^2 + 0^2) = 0.4`. This is well within 4. Good.
           
           For `v14` being above rocks (`v4`, `v8`):
           - `#o5-v4`: `v14` above `v4`. `v4` at ((-1.941, 1.379), (-1.856, 1.463)), center (-1.8985, 1.421).
             - Let's try `(-1.8985, 1.6)`. `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). A configuration close to the rock would be better. Let's make it the same for `#o5-v8`.
           - `#o5-v8`: `v14` above `v8`. `v8` at ((1.357, 1.39), (1.497, 1.531)), center (1.427, 1.4605).
           
           It seems `#o5` for `v4` and `#o5` for `v8` will have to be different configurations because `v4` and `v8` are quite far apart.
           The same logic applies to `#o5` as to `#o3`.
           
           - `#o5-v4`: For `v14` above `v4`. `v4` center (-1.8985, 1.421). Let's use `(-1.8985, 1.421)` (directly above). This is well within 2.
           - `#o5-v8`: For `v14` above `v8`. `v8` center (1.427, 1.4605). Let's use `(1.427, 1.4605)` (directly above).
           
           I will follow the interpretation that for each distinct (rover, target object) pair that uses a continuous parameter, I must provide a specific continuous value, even if the same '#' variable is used in the PDDL facts. I'll define these with suffixes.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v14 #o3-v17 #o4 v17 v10) , (take_image v14 #o3-v17 #o4 v17 v10 v11) , (calibrate v14 #o3-v18 #o4 v18 v10) , (take_image v14 #o3-v18 #o4 v18 v10 v11) , (calibrate v14 #o3-v19 #o4 v19 v10) , (take_image v14 #o3-v19 #o4 v19 v10 v11) , (send_image v14 #o0-v9 #o1 v9 v17 v11) , (send_image v14 #o0-v9 #o1 v9 v18 v11) , (send_image v14 #o0-v9 #o1 v9 v19 v11) , (sample_rock v14 #o5-v4 v4 v16) , (send_analysis v14 #o0-v9 #o1 v9 v4) , (sample_rock v14 #o5-v8 v8 v16) , (send_analysis v14 #o0-v9 #o1 v9 v8)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The provided list of valid action instances is extremely limited. It only includes `move` actions that move the rovers to their current locations (effectively no-ops) and `drop_rock` actions. None of the actions required to achieve the goal (like `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`) are present in the allowed list of action instances.
           
           Therefore, it is impossible to achieve the goal `Atom new-axiom@0()` (which requires receiving images and analyses) using only the given valid actions.
           
           The goal is unreachable with the provided action instances.
