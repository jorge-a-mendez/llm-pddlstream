(Thoughts: **Planning to Satisfy a New Axiom**
           
           My primary objective is to achieve the state defined by the axiom `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a specific type "on" another object.  Breaking this down, I need to find an object of type `v17` and ensure it's "on" `v18`.  I see I have two potential candidates, `v8` and `v12`, both of type `v17`. I'll start by focusing on `v8`.
           
           For `v8` to be "on" `v18`, it must be supported by `v18` and currently at a pose, say `?p`, and `atpose(v8, ?p)` must be true.  I checked the initial state and identified that `v8` is currently `atpose(v8, v9)` and also `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. This means my plan is to get `v8` to `atpose(#o2)`.
           
           To achieve this, I'll need a two-step action sequence:  First, `pick` up `v8` from its current pose `v9`, then `place` it onto the target pose `#o2`.
           
           However, before I can pick, I must ensure the robot's base configuration is correct. The `kin` predicate hints I need to be at base configuration `#o3` for the pick action.  The initial state reveals a `basemotion` from `v3` to `#o3`, so my plan will begin with `move_base(v3, #o3, #o0)`.
           
           Let's dissect the first action, `move_base`:  Its preconditions are simply that a suitable `basemotion` exists and that the robot is currently at a valid base configuration and can move. All of these conditions are met.  Executing `move_base` will, in effect, move the base and satisfy the first step.
           
           Now, for the subsequent picking step, `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`, the robot must have a `kin` relationship to do the task and the object must currently be `atpose(v8, v9)` (which it is), the robot must have `handempty` and be at `atbconf(#o3)`. All necessary criteria are met. The action's effect negates `atpose(v8, v9)` and establishes `atgrasp(v4, v8, #o1)`.
           
           Now that the robot's hand has the object, I can focus on the placement, `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`. All conditions align, including `kin` relation for `place`, `atgrasp`, and the base configuration, thus I can proceed.  The action results in `atpose(v8, #o2)` and confirms the achievement of the overall goal, `new-axiom@0()`.
           
           In short, the overall plan is to use a `move_base` action followed by a pick and a place action to put the object on the target. All preconditions and post-conditions confirm the validity of the action sequence.
