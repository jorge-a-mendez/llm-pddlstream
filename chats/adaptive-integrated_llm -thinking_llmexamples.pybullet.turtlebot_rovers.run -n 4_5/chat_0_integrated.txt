           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Plan for New Axiom Application**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My primary goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, but this boils down to some key tasks: getting images of specific objectives, analyzing rocks, and sending all this data to the lander.  I've got two rovers, v12 and v14, each at a fixed location (v13 and v15, respectively). The trick here is that they *can't* move. This limits my options but simplifies the planning.
           
           First, I see that I already have the 'type' facts and initial configuration for the rovers. That's a good starting point. I need images of objectives v17, v18, v19, and v20, all in mode v11, plus analysis of a rock of type v2 and one of type v6.
           
           Since both rovers are capable, I've decided to make rover v12 handle the image acquisition and data transmission. This streamlines things. I'll get v12 to:
           
           1.  **Calibrate, Take, and Send Images:** For each objective, calibrate the camera, take the picture, and then send it to the lander. Each picture requires recalibration due to the 'uncalibrated' effect of taking a picture.
           2.  **Analyze and Transmit Rock Analysis:** I will have rover v12 sample a rock of type v2 (let's say v1) and send the analysis to the lander.
           3. **Analyze and Transmit Rock Analysis by v14:** Rover v14 will perform the same operations on a rock of type v6 (I'll go with v5).
           
           The reason I split it that way is simple: I need two different types of rock analyses, and it seems easier to have two rovers sampling simultaneously.
           
           The plan depends critically on the initial state facts, specifically those stating visibility and reach. Since the rovers are fixed, the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` relations given at the start are crucial. I *must* use the given continuous values for these conditions or the plan fails. It's a key assumption because the fixed locations make reaching any other position impossible.
           
           My actions will follow this order:
           1.  Rover v12 calibrates, takes an image, and sends the image for v19, v17, v20, and v18.
           2.  Rover v12 then samples rock v1 and sends the analysis.
           3.  Rover v14 samples rock v5 and sends the analysis.
           
           This should fulfill all the preconditions of the goal! No dropping rocks required, as the shared storage unit is a different space for each rover. Also, no movement is needed, so I can rely on the existing 'imagevisible' and 'comvisible' facts to meet my objectives.
           
           All I need to specify are the values:
           *   (x, y) coordinates for `#o0` to `v9` for v12: `(1.0, -1.75)` which is v13's config.
           *   (x, y) coordinates for `#o3` (image) for v12 and each of `v19`, `v17`, `v20`, `v18`: `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           *   (x, y) coordinates for `#o0` to `v9` for v14: `(-1.0, -1.75)` which is v15's config.
           
           Now I just need to translate this into a sequence of PDDL actions, making sure to explicitly calibrate before taking an image to keep to the `calibrated` precondition. This setup gives me a quick route to the 'new-axiom@0()' goal!

Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Unattainable Goal**
           
           Okay, I've got to take a step back and re-evaluate this. The user pointed out a crucial oversight: the *only* actions allowed are `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))`, `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`, `((drop_rock v12 v16))`, and `((drop_rock v14 v16))`.  I completely missed that constraint!
           
           So, the goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which expands to a conjunction of several atoms.  The first four conditions, `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, and `free(v14, v16)`, are already satisfied in the initial state. The `move` actions are essentially no-ops, and the `drop_rock` actions won't change anything because the system isn't 'full'.
           
           Now, I'm focusing on the remaining conditions related to images and analysis: `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedimage(v20, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           To achieve these, I'd need to use actions like `send_image`, `take_image`, `calibrate`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`.  The problem is, *none* of those actions are in the allowed list!
           
           Since I'm stuck with `move` and `drop_rock` – which don't affect images or analysis – I'm essentially hitting a dead end. I cannot take images, send them, sample anything, or send those samples for analysis.  Therefore, I'm forced to conclude that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is simply unreachable within these limited actions. I should not return any plan because it is not possible to achieve the goal given the provided constraints.
