           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Planning Process**
           
           Okay, here's what I've got to do: I need to create a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This means making sure a bunch of conditions are true, including taking pictures of some objectives, analyzing samples, and sending the results back to base.  I see that the plan already starts with some conditions met, like the rovers being in the right initial states. My focus will be the image and sample related actions.
           
           First, I need to get images of four different objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) using `v12` camera (v10) with the mode v11.  The `take_image` action is the key, but it needs preconditions like `imagevisible`, `calibrated` and also the rover must be at an accessible configuration. I'll need to use the `calibrate` action before `take_image` to satisfy the preconditions. The main idea is:
           1. `v12` will handle all the image taking. I will need to provide it with four image configurations, `#o3`, one for each objective. I will move v12 to these locations and take images, then move it to a comms config.
           2. `v14` will handle all the sample-taking and sending. I will need to move it to a sample config to be above the rock, then to a comms config, send the analysis, drop the rock, then get to a new sample config for the next sample.
           
           This means I need to carefully organize the movements of both rovers. It's a sequence of actions like move to image capture config, calibrate, take image and so on.
           
           The hard part is the geometry and knowing that the range constraint for image visibility and range constraint for comms are small. The constraints are hard and require the use of multiple moves. I will then have to declare the specific configuration coordinates needed for `imagevisible` and `comvisible`. I will choose reasonable coordinates for all.  These configurations will involve move actions from an initial position (`v13` or `v15`) to the config object, using `move`. This is where I'll get to use the geometric analysis.
           
           I'll use one rover `v12` to handle all images, making sure it goes to 4 different image-capture configurations `#o3`, and then another for comms. I will use `v14` to take the sample, send the results, drop samples.
           
           Then, there are the samples. I need to sample two rocks (a "stone" and a "soil"), `v1` and `v5` respectively. This means using the action `sample_rock`. The rover `v14` needs to be "above" these rocks. `sample_rock` has a precondition `free` which I can only meet via a `drop_rock` action. I will add the `drop_rock` actions in to meet the sample and send requirements. I also need to make sure the send actions have the correct configuration and the rocks will be sent to the lander using the ray object #o1.
           
           Finally, I need to make sure the final states for both rovers are the initial ones (`v13` and `v15`), so I will add a final move actions for all. The final result will be all the actions in the correct sequence, a sequence of move, sample/image, send/calibrate actions in their correct form.

           1. `v12` will handle all the image taking. I will need to provide it with four image configurations, `#o3`, one for each objective. I will move v12 to these locations and take images, then move it to a comms config.
           2. `v14` will handle all the sample-taking and sending. I will need to move it to a sample config to be above the rock, then to a comms config, send the analysis, drop the rock, then get to a new sample config for the next sample.
           
           This means I need to carefully organize the movements of both rovers. It's a sequence of actions like move to image capture config, calibrate, take image and so on.
           
           The hard part is the geometry and knowing that the range constraint for image visibility and range constraint for comms are small. The constraints are hard and require the use of multiple moves. I will then have to declare the specific configuration coordinates needed for `imagevisible` and `comvisible`. I will choose reasonable coordinates for all.  These configurations will involve move actions from an initial position (`v13` or `v15`) to the config object, using `move`. This is where I'll get to use the geometric analysis.
           
           I'll use one rover `v12` to handle all images, making sure it goes to 4 different image-capture configurations `#o3`, and then another for comms. I will use `v14` to take the sample, send the results, drop samples.
           
           Then, there are the samples. I need to sample two rocks (a "stone" and a "soil"), `v1` and `v5` respectively. This means using the action `sample_rock`. The rover `v14` needs to be "above" these rocks. `sample_rock` has a precondition `free` which I can only meet via a `drop_rock` action. I will add the `drop_rock` actions in to meet the sample and send requirements. I also need to make sure the send actions have the correct configuration and the rocks will be sent to the lander using the ray object #o1.
           
           Finally, I need to make sure the final states for both rovers are the initial ones (`v13` and `v15`), so I will add a final move actions for all. The final result will be all the actions in the correct sequence, a sequence of move, sample/image, send/calibrate actions in their correct form.

(Thoughts: **Revised Plan for Rover Operations**
           
           Okay, here's what I've got: based on the user's feedback, I've re-evaluated the rover's planned configurations to ensure they're collision-free, have clear line-of-sight, are reachable, and stay within range. I need to make sure I get those images and rock samples to achieve our objective.
           
           **Re-evaluation of the Plan:**
           
           I focused on the problematic configurations and suggested replacements. I've adjusted the positioning of the rover (v12) when imaging the targets (v17, v18, v19, v20). I've changed the communication points to avoid collisions with the thin vertical obstacle (v21) and to ensure that the communications with the lander (v9) don't intersect with it. I confirmed the plan for the Rover v14, which involved rock sampling.
           
           Here are the specific updates:
           
           *   For `v12`, when capturing images:
               *   Target `v18` has a new configuration at (1.0, 1.0).
               *   Target `v19` now requires configuration (-0.1, 0.5) (originally at (0.0, 0.5)).
               *   Target `v20` has configuration (-1.0, 0.5).
               *   Communicating with the lander (v9) requires the configuration at (0.1, -1.8).
           *   For Rover v14, which involves rock sampling, communication locations remain as initially planned, with slight adjustments for collisions.
           
           The plan itself, which ensures that both rovers are configured such that they satisfy the image visible and com visible predicates, has been updated with new coordinates.
           
           **The Updated Plan:**
           
           **Rover v12 - Image Tasks:**
           
           1.  Move to (0.3, 0.5) to capture an image of v17.
           2.  Move to (1.0, 1.0) to capture an image of v18.
           3.  Move to (-0.1, 0.5) to capture an image of v19.
           4.  Move to (-1.0, 0.5) to capture an image of v20.
           5.  Move to (0.1, -1.8) to communicate with the lander (v9).
           6.  Return to starting location at v13.
           
           **Rover v14 - Rock Analysis Tasks:**
           
           1.  Move to (2.18, -1.36) to sample rock v1.
           2.  Communicate with the lander (v9) at (-1.9, -1.5) to send the analysis.
           3.  Move to (-0.66, 1.35) to sample rock v5.
           4.  Communicate with the lander (v9) again at (-1.9, -1.5) to send the analysis.
           5.  Return to the starting location at v15.
           
           The motion commands will ensure that v12 transitions from one image location to another, going through a communication task. Meanwhile, v14 performs a similar transition plan to get samples and transmit them.
           
           I will verify the final plan to ensure it meets our goals (all images and samples received and analyzed).

(Thoughts: **Revisiting Rover Configurations for Successful Planning**
           
           I've been wrestling with this planning problem, and after multiple failed attempts, I need to craft a rock-solid plan that ensures reachability, collision avoidance, and no occlusion. My previous approaches haven't worked, so I'm carefully re-evaluating the object positions and constraints to find viable configurations. I must choose coordinates for the rovers' poses very carefully, and use the symbolic trajectories to do so.
           
           Here's my refined thinking:
           
           **Key Obstacles and Objectives:** The scene involves several rocks, objectives (potentially signal beacons), a lander, and a vertical wall (v21) at x=0. The rovers need to image and sample the scene, and I have to choose poses which can accomplish the task.
           
           **Rover `v12` (Positive X):**
           The key issue for v12 is the vertical wall. To navigate the tasks efficiently, it should stay to the positive-x side as much as possible, if at all possible. I've calculated the following potential poses, keeping image visibility and reachability in mind:
           *   `v17` (Image): Needs a pose at approx `(0.5, 0.5)` for a distance of approximately 1.6m.
           *   `v18` (Image): Needs `(1.5, 0.5)` at a distance of approx 1.43m.
           *   `v19` (Image): To the negative side of the wall, so needs a crossing. Let's try `(-0.2, 0.5)` to get within 1.7m.
           *   `v20` (Image): Another objective on the negative side, so crossing necessary. I'll use `(-1.5, 0.5)` to meet a distance of approx 1.61m.
           *   Communicate: I must be able to communicate with the lander `v9`. Let's try `(-0.5, -1.8)` at 1.41m.
           
           **Rover `v14` (Negative X):**
           Given the vertical wall, `v14` needs to operate primarily on the negative X side.
           *   `v1` (Stone Sampling): Must cross over the wall, so I'll put a sampling point at the rock position, which should be `(2.18, -1.36)`.
           *   `v5` (Soil Sampling): Let's use `(-0.66, 1.35)` to keep on the same side.
           *   Communicate: We need to coordinate with `v9`. I'll try `(-1.5, -1.5)`. This pose avoids collision with `v9` (lander) and is at a safe distance.
           
           **Revised Plan:**
           
           1.  **`v12` (Images):**
               *   Starting at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
               *   Move to `(0.5, 0.5)` for `v17` and take the image.
               *   Move to `(1.5, 0.5)` for `v18` and take an image.
               *   Move to `(-0.2, 0.5)` for `v19` crossing the wall, and take an image.
               *   Move to `(-1.5, 0.5)` for `v20` and take the image.
               *   Move to `(-0.5, -1.8)` and communicate with the lander.
               *   Move back to `v13`.
           
           2.  **`v14` (Analysis):**
               *   Starting at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
               *   Move to `(2.18, -1.36)` and sample `v1`.
               *   Move to `(-1.5, -1.5)` to coordinate with the lander.
               *   Move to `(-0.66, 1.35)` to sample `v5`.
               *   Move to `(-1.5, -1.5)` to coordinate again.
               *   Move back to `v15`.
           
           I've confirmed the distances, AABBs, and rover radius (assuming approximately 0.2m). `v21` is a thin wall. I've rechecked to make sure no rovers will collide with the lander. I've used motion predicates to ensure each point is reached in an efficient path.

           **Revised Plan:**
           
           1.  **`v12` (Images):**
               *   Starting at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
               *   Move to `(0.5, 0.5)` for `v17` and take the image.
               *   Move to `(1.5, 0.5)` for `v18` and take an image.
               *   Move to `(-0.2, 0.5)` for `v19` crossing the wall, and take an image.
               *   Move to `(-1.5, 0.5)` for `v20` and take the image.
               *   Move to `(-0.5, -1.8)` and communicate with the lander.
               *   Move back to `v13`.
           
           2.  **`v14` (Analysis):**
               *   Starting at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
               *   Move to `(2.18, -1.36)` and sample `v1`.
               *   Move to `(-1.5, -1.5)` to coordinate with the lander.
               *   Move to `(-0.66, 1.35)` to sample `v5`.
               *   Move to `(-1.5, -1.5)` to coordinate again.
               *   Move back to `v15`.
           
           I've confirmed the distances, AABBs, and rover radius (assuming approximately 0.2m). `v21` is a thin wall. I've rechecked to make sure no rovers will collide with the lander. I've used motion predicates to ensure each point is reached in an efficient path.
           
           I'm

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm dealing with. The main goal is to get two different rovers to achieve a "new-axiom" state by hitting a series of objectives in the `rovers` domain. The crucial constraints are:
           
           *   **Imaging:** Capture images of four objects (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`) with a camera, ensuring the camera view has a range of 2 meters.
           *   **Sampling and Analysis:** Collect and analyze rock and soil samples (specified by types `v2` and `v6`).
           *   **Communication:** Send the gathered image and analysis data to a lander, `v9`.
           
           We are given an initial state where two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, are at locations `v13` and `v15` respectively, with their cameras and the area free of obstacles.
           
           The challenges are all too familiar. In previous attempts, the most frequent roadblock has been reachability, specifically the inability of the robot base to reach specified (x, y) coordinates. This could mean coordinates that are far away or the presence of obstacles. Also, the rovers are differential drive robots, and I need to account for their movement and turning capabilities. I've also run into visibility issues. The target objects might be out of range or blocked by a barrier. And of course, there's always the risk of collisions with fixed obstacles.
           
           **Proposed Strategy: Divide and Conquer, with Careful Configuration**
           
           To tackle these problems, I'm going for a task-specific division:
           
           *   **Rover `v12` (Initial location: `(1.0, -1.75)`)** will be in charge of all image capturing and transmitting.
           *   **Rover `v14` (Initial location: `(-1.0, -1.75)`)** is assigned the sample collection and analysis.
           
           Crucial to the plan's success is selecting proper configurations, or in-between positions:
           
           *   **Reachability:** I'll aim for configurations that are close to each target and within an estimated movement range of the rovers. I'll need to figure out the maximum move distance in a single step - this seems to be a key factor based on those previous failures.
           *   **Collision-Free:** Avoiding the `x=0` wall (`v21`), and the lander `v9` is critical.
           *   **Visibility:** Ensuring the imaging positions are within 2m and communication positions within 4m of their respective targets, with no obstructions.
           *   **Proximity:** Selecting the configurations close to the targets and within reach of the rovers.
           
           I had split imaging to each of the rovers.
           
           **Detailed Plan and Configuration Selection**
           
           Based on this, here's the detailed plan, including the proposed coordinates (the configurations) that the rovers are to be located:
           
           *   **Rover `v12`:**
               *   **Move:** From `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(0.8, 0.5)`.
               *   **Image `v17`**: At the same point,  `v17` is now "seen".
               *   **Move:** From `(0.8, 0.5)` to `(1.5, 0.5)`.
               *   **Image `v18`**: Take image of `v18`.
               *   **Sample `v1`**: Move to `(2.18, -1.36)`  and take sample.
               *   **Send:** Communicate from location `(0.5, -1.8)`.
           
           *   **Rover `v14`:**
               *   **Move:** From `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-0.6, 0.5)`.
               *   **Image `v19`**: Take image `v19`.
               *   **Move:** From `(-0.6, 0.5)` to `(-1.5, 0.5)`.
               *   **Image `v20`**: Take image of `v20`.
               *   **Sample `v7`**: Sample soil.
               *   **Send:** Communicate from `-0.5, -1.35)`.
           
           **Key Considerations and Potential Problem Areas**
           
           The most significant remaining concern is the "reachable" criteria and the implied movement range. The errors flagged "not reachable" implies that the range is much smaller than the objective distances, and this must be addressed. Based on the past errors, a move distance of around
