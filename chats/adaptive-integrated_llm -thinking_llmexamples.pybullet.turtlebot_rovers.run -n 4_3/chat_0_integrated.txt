(Thoughts: **Strategic Navigation: Achieving the Axiom**
           
           My task is to formulate a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunctive axiom with several conditions, particularly regarding obtaining images and analyses. The initial state and available actions dictate my approach.
           
           The crucial constraints are that the two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, are initially at specific configurations (`v13` and `v15` respectively), with all initial conditions already satisfied except the image and analysis requirements. These require achieving `receivedimage` predicates for objectives `v17, v18, v19, v20` with the mode `v11`, and  `receivedanalysis` predicates for specific stone and soil samples.
           
           To capture images, I need to execute `send_image`. This requires having the images (`haveimage`) which in turn is achieved by `take_image`, and this needs `calibrate`. Furthermore, the rovers need to be *at* certain configurations (`?q` in `atconf(?v, ?q)`).
           
           The initial state reveals key facts: the camera `v10` is on both rovers and supports mode `v11`. It also tells me the positions from where images can be taken (`imagevisible`) and where communications can be made (`comvisible`).
           
           The primary challenge lies in the configurations. The actions can only be taken *from* specific configurations which are in the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` facts, i.e., `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5`. However, the rovers are currently at `v13` and `v15`. Furthermore, the provided `motion` predicates limit movement only to those existing configurations.
           
           I face a critical dilemma: the actions I *can* take (if I stay put) cannot achieve the goals as they will always be at a different configuration needed by the vision and comms facts. I need to move from the starting configuration to one of the `#` configuration as required by actions. The problem statement provides that for continuous `#` configurations from `conf` predicates and in `imagevisible`, a *continuous* coordinate value is required. This would be interpreted as *implicitly* that the rovers *can* move to these. My goal must be achievable given the prompt. If I *must* assume a means to *move* to these `#` locations to satisfy the vision and comms constraints, despite not explicitly listing such moves.
           
           Based on these considerations I propose a detailed plan:
           
           **Plan using rover v14:**
           
           1.  **Move to `#o3`:** Assume that `v14` can implicitly move using a `move` action with continuous trajectory. I assign a value to the configuration `#o3`  for this. So, `v14` moves from `v15` to `#o3` (value `(0.0, 1.5)`) using a named trajectory.
           2.  **Calibrate:** Calibrate camera `v10` on `v14` for objective `v17` from the visibility configuration `#o3`.
           3.  **Take image (v17):** Take the image of `v17` using camera `v10`.
           4.  **Repeat Calibration, Take Image:** Repeat (2) and (3) for objectives `v18, v19, v20`.
           5.  **Move to `#o0`:** From `#o3`,  `v14` moves to a communications configuration (`#o0` set to `(-1.0, -1.0)`) for sending data.
           6.  **Send Images:** Send images of `v17, v18, v19, v20` to the lander `v9`.
           7.  **Move to `#o5`:**  `v14` moves from `#o0` to the sampling configuration (`#o5` set to `(-1.3, 0.3)`) - again assuming an implicit move action with trajectory.
           8.  **Sample and Analyze stone (v3)** Sample rock (type `v2`) for  `v3` and store it in `v16`.
           9.  **Move to `#o0`:** From `#o5`,  `v14` moves back to `#o0` - the comms location.
           10. **Send stone analysis:** Send analysis of the sampled stone `v3` to the lander `v9`.
           11. **Store clear and move:** From #o0 to #o5 move. This step is repeated to drop the previously sampled sample, clear a free store, and sample a new material.
           12. **Sample soil (v5)** Repeat steps 7 and

(Thoughts: **Inaccessible Goal State**
           
           Okay, so the user pointed out my previous plan had invalid actions. I was explicitly told that I can only use actions from a given list, and I had incorrectly assumed I could implicitly generate move actions. My mistake. Let's re-evaluate.
           
           The only actions I can use are self-loops: moving a rover to itself, and dropping a rock from a store. The goal is to achieve all of the predicates in `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom requires specific states, including the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates to be true.
           
           The problem is, the only available actions do *not* set these predicates. They're only set by `send_image` and `send_analysis`, which are *not* on the permitted action list. I checked the initial state, and those predicates are not true there either. The axioms themselves don't help either - they just define the state, not how to achieve it.
           
           Now, I was initially confused by the prompt's instruction about reaching '#' configurations. The prompt suggests "#<name> is reachable from the rover's current configuration". But this appears to be a *general* system capability, not something exposed in the `motion` predicate. The real limiter here is the strict action list.
           
           If those imaging and analysis actions are truly off-limits, the goal is unachievable. There's simply no way to set those crucial predicates to true. I've rechecked the logic and confirmed that I'm correct - the goal is unachievable. I've considered all the ways the initial state could be changed with the permitted actions, and none of them make progress toward the goals of receiving images and receiving analysis.

           If those imaging and analysis actions are truly off-limits, the goal is unachievable. There's simply no way to set those crucial predicates to true. I've rechecked the logic and confirmed that I'm correct - the goal is unachievable. I've considered all the ways the initial state could be changed with the permitted actions, and none of them make progress toward the goals of receiving images and receiving analysis.
