           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Path to New Knowledge**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is crystal clear: to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. This means getting images and analyses, which, luckily, aligns perfectly with my existing capabilities! I'm starting with the initial state and using actions like `move`, `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `drop_rock`, and `send_analysis`. Seems pretty straightforward, but let's be meticulous.
           
           I notice that the conditions like `atconf` and `free` are already met in the initial state. Perfect! Saves me some work. The main challenge lies in satisfying those `receivedimage` predicates for different objectives. This is where my trusty rover, `v14`, comes in.
           
           To get those images, I need `take_image`, which requires `calibrate`. So, I'll first move `v14` to a strategic location, which is `#o3`. Then, I'll calibrate the camera, take pictures of the four objectives, move to location `#o0`, and send those images to the lander. I'll need to calibrate the camera before taking each image, which is worth keeping in mind. The rover, `v14`, will handle the image capture and transmission, with `#o3` and `#o0` as key configurations.
           
           Next, I need to analyze rocks. I'll have `v14` get the analysis of a stone and soil by moving to `#o5` to sample rocks, store the samples, move back to `#o0`, and send the results to the lander. The store `v16` will become full. So, `v14` must be moved back to the initial configuration and the samples must be dropped.
           
           The trickiest part will be figuring out the coordinates for those key configurations (`#o0` and `#o3`). I need to make sure that these are within the visual ranges and that rover's movement distance will be reasonable. The problem statement says the configurations need to be specific for my chosen rover. I'll have to use my expert knowledge of object locations to select precise continuous values for these objects. Let's see...I think I can nail this with some precise calculations! I'll choose `#o0` to allow for easy image transmission to the lander and `#o3` to have all image targets in the rover's vision field. The movement range seems reasonable too.

The problem statement says the configurations need to be specific for my chosen rover. I'll have to use my expert knowledge of object locations to select precise continuous values for these objects. Let's see...I think I can nail this with some precise calculations! I'll choose `#o0` to allow for easy image transmission to the lander and `#o3` to have all image targets in the rover's vision field. The movement range seems reasonable too.

           Okay, the previous plan had a fatal flaw: the configurations I selected for imaging (`#o3`) and communication (`#o0`) were smack-dab in the path of some nasty obstacles. That's a no-go. I need to rethink these positions, and fast.
           
           **Obstacles:**
           
           *   **Vertical Wall:** `v21` (x=0) – This is a tall, thin barrier right down the middle.
           *   **Rectangular Block:** `v22` (x=0.25-0.75, y=1.75-2.25) – A chunky obstacle in the upper-right area.
           *   **The Lander Itself:** `v9` (around x=-1.9, y=-2.0) – It was the goal, and also a collision concern.
           
           **My Plan:**
           
           *   **Imaging Rover** `v14` needs to position itself to see the images: `v17, v18, v19, and v20`.
           *   **`#o3` Refinement:** After some careful calculations, the robot, `v14`, must go to `(-0.5, 1.9, 0.0)` for images. It clears `v21` and `v22` by positioning the robot to a place far enough left and up in the field.
           *   **Communicating with Lander**: I now need to reevaluate how communication will go. The previous `#o0` was in the lander, and it caused collision with the lander; therefore it's a huge problem. Instead I found `(-0.5, -1.75)` to be clear.
           
           The key to a collision-free plan lies in the geometry of the obstacles and the effective imaging and communication of the robot.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Revisions for a Successful Plan**
           
           Okay, after a thorough review of the failed attempts, the key lies in understanding the previous collisions and addressing reachability issues. We must ensure rover configurations are collision-free and communication-capable.
           
           Firstly, the imaging poses need careful consideration. The rovers' dimensions, approximately 0.4x0.4m, necessitate collision-free positions. We'll set rover configurations using x,y coordinates and an angle (theta) of imaging or communication:
           
           *   For imaging target `v17, v18, v19`, `v14` needs to be away from `v23` obstacle at  `(-0.9, 1.8, 0.0)` for the first target `v17` and a different position `(-1.5, 1.8, 3.14)` for the third target `v19`.
           *   For imaging target `v20`, `v12` must be at `(1.5, 1.8, 0.0)`.
           *   The previous communication pose `(-0.5, -1.75, 0.0)` for all rovers proved to be unreachable. This seems to be because of the kinematic limitations of the rovers in that area, or there may have been narrow passages that were missed. To avoid issues, we'll aim for configurations that are nearby. The plan includes the values for each rover to be `(-1.05, -1.75, 3.14)` and `(1.05, -1.75, 3.14)`.
           
           Now, we must consider the action sequence for the new plan. Rover `v14` (initial position `v15=(-1.0, -1.75)`) is closer to a good sampling pose.
           *   We'll use `v14` to image the area around `v17` (at  `(-0.9, 1.8, 0.0)`), and then for the area around `v19` (at `(-1.5, 1.8, 3.14)`), after that `v14` will sample objects and transmit data.
           *   Rover `v12` (initial position `v13=(1.0, -1.75)`) will be used for imaging `v20` (at `(1.5, 1.8, 0.0)`), and `v18` at (`1.0, 1.8, 3.14)`), and then it will send the data.
           
           Specifically, the rovers will perform tasks in this order, making sure the plan follows the instructions given:
           
           *   **Imaging & Calibration:**  
               *   `v14` will move to `(-0.9, 1.8, 0.0)` and then `(-1.5, 1.8, 3.14)` for calibration, and image and take images of targets at those positions.
               *   `v12` will move to `(1.0, 1.8, 3.14)` and then `(1.5, 1.8, 0.0)` for calibration, and images for those targets at those positions.
           *   **Sampling & Analysis:**  `v14` will position itself to `#o5`, and sample rocks.
           *   **Communications:** Both rovers will communicate at their new locations to ensure a high probability of reception by the command center. They will move to their designated configurations and will communicate with their assigned targets.
           *   Finally, the plan will revert the rovers back to their initial positions.

(Thoughts: **Plan Refinement and Configuration Review**
           
           Alright, after the previous plan failed, it's time to re-evaluate. I need to get this right. The focus is on ensuring these rovers, specifically `#o0` for communication and `#o3` for imaging, are configured properly, and that I can actually get them to those configurations. I know the goal is to have the rovers in the right places, receiving and analyzing images and samples.
           
           I've got a list of fixed obstacles and the AABB of the objects I need to image and sample. The initial rover configurations and their sizes are also laid out. The key now is to identify new configurations that will let the rovers reach the objects and communicate.
           
           **Imaging Poses:** I'm sticking with the strategy of splitting the imaging between rovers. For rover `v14`, I'm looking at poses to capture images of `v17` and `v19`. I checked these poses in the last attempt, but need to reiterate due to collision issues. For imaging `v17`, I need `v14` at `(-1.2, 1.8, 0.0)`. It should be clear of `v23` because the bounding box would not overlap. For imaging `v19`, a pose for `v14` at `(-1.8, 1.7, 3.14)` is sufficient. For rover `v12`, poses at `(0.8, 1.7, 3.14)` for `v18` and `(1.6, 1.7, 0.0)` for `v20`. No collision with nearby obstacles.  These are within range (2 meters), and free from collisions.
           
           **Communication Poses:** Next, I'm working on the communication configuration (`#o0`). The lander `v9` is at a fixed position, and I need to find poses for both rovers to connect to it. For `v14`, the configuration is `(-1.0, -1.5, 3.14)`. For `v12`, it is `(1.0, -1.5, 3.14)`.  These are far enough away, but still within range (4 meters).
           
           **Sampling Poses:** Now, for the sampling, I have the predicate `above(v14, #o5, v1)` and `above(v14, #o5, v5)`, which indicates that I need a `#o5` configuration that allows for sampling rocks. The trick is to identify a single `above` pose for both `v1` and `v5`. It seems that my assumption about individual configurations was correct. Since a general pose that could sample *all* the rocks at once is probably impossible, I can keep the initial idea to go after `v1` and `v5` (Stone and Soil, respectively).
           
           The configurations and the plan seem to be okay, so I will define configurations for the rovers: I need `v14` and `v12` to be at specified poses to take and send images, and `v14` to have access to `above` the rocks. The motion predicates also confirm that the rovers are capable of moving to the new configurations. I can now generate a plan that specifies exactly where the rovers will have to move.

The motion predicates also confirm that the rovers are capable of moving to the new configurations. I can now generate a plan that specifies exactly where the rovers will have to move.
