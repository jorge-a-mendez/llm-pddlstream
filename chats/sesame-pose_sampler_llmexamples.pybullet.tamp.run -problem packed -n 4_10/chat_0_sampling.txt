           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27x0.27. The object is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0987x0.0987. Since the object is smaller than the surface, there are many possible stable placements. I will try to place the object in various positions and orientations on the surface, ensuring it remains within the surface's bounds.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface (0.27x0.27) at the origin. I have successfully placed object 7 at the center of the surface. Now I need to place object 4, which is also a square object of similar dimensions (approx. 0.0983x0.0983).
           
           I need to find placements for object 4 that are stable on surface 0 and do not collide with object 7. Since object 7 is at (0,0) and has an extent of 0.0987, any placement for object 4 must be far enough from the origin to avoid collision. The sum of half-extents of the two objects is roughly (0.0987/2 + 0.0983/2) = 0.04935 + 0.04915 = 0.0985. So, the minimum distance between their centers in any axis-aligned direction should be around 0.0985 to avoid collision when they are axis-aligned. I will try to place object 4 in the corners and along the edges of the surface, respecting the collision constraint.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface (0.27x0.27) at the origin.
           I have successfully placed object 7 at (0,0) with extent 0.0987.
           I have successfully placed object 4 at (0.09, 0.0) with extent 0.0983.
           Now I need to place object 5, which is a square object of extent 0.0816.
           
           I need to find placements for object 5 that are stable on surface 0 and do not collide with object 7 or object 4.
           Collision with object 7 (center (0,0), half-extents 0.04935):
           Min center distance (axis-aligned) for object 5 (half-extents 0.04078) with object 7: 0.04935 + 0.04078 = 0.09013.
           Collision with object 4 (center (0.09,0), half-extents 0.04915):
           Min center distance (axis-aligned) for object 5 with object 4: 0.04915 + 0.04078 = 0.08993.
           
           Given object 7 is at (0,0) and object 4 is at (0.09, 0.0), I can try to place object 5 on the other side of object 7 (negative X), or above/below both objects (positive/negative Y).
           For example, a placement at (-0.09, 0.0) would be a good candidate for the negative X side.
           Or a placement like (0.0, 0.09) would try to place it above object 7, and if it's far enough, it might also clear object 4.
           Let's calculate the clearance needed for (0.0, 0.09) with respect to object 4:
           Object 4: x range [0.09 - 0.04915, 0.09 + 0.04915] = [0.04085, 0.13915], y range [-0.04915, 0.04915]
           Object 5 at (0, 0.09): x range [-0.04078, 0.04078], y range [0.09 - 0.04078, 0.09 + 0.04078] = [0.04822, 0.13078]
           These do not collide. So (0.0, 0.09) is a good candidate.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface (0.27x0.27) at the origin.
           I have successfully placed object 7 at (0,0) with extent 0.0987.
           I have successfully placed object 4 at (0.09, 0.0) with extent 0.0983.
           I have successfully placed object 5 at (-0.09, 0.0) with extent 0.0816.
           Now I need to place object 6, which is a square object of extent 0.0985.
           
           I need to find placements for object 6 that are stable on surface 0 and do not collide with object 7, object 4, or object 5.
           All three placed objects are currently on the X-axis:
           Object 7: center (0,0), half-extents 0.04935. X-range: [-0.04935, 0.04935]
           Object 4: center (0.09,0), half-extents 0.04915. X-range: [0.09-0.04915, 0.09+0.04915] = [0.04085, 0.13915]
           Object 5: center (-0.09,0), half-extents 0.04078. X-range: [-0.09-0.04078, -0.09+0.04078] = [-0.13078, -0.04922]
           
           It seems there is a "row" of objects along the X-axis: Object 5, Object 7, Object 4.
           The combined X-range of these objects is approximately [-0.13078, 0.13915].
           The surface X-range is [-0.135, 0.135]. Object 4's right edge (0.13915) is slightly outside the surface (0.135), but it was marked as a success, which means the check for full containment might have some tolerance, or the actual extent might be slightly different. For future placements, I should be careful to stay within the nominal bounds.
           Let's re-evaluate object 4's X-range. If object 4 is at (0.09, 0.0) and has `size_x = 0.09831407892044935`, then its half-extent is `0.049157`. So its X-range is `[0.09 - 0.049157, 0.09 + 0.049157] = [0.040843, 0.139157]`. This is indeed slightly outside the surface upper bound of 0.135. Given that it was successful, I will assume a small tolerance for the surface bounds (e.g., 0.005) or that the given surface bounds are slightly smaller than the actual available space. However, I will still aim to place new objects well within the given bounds.
           
           Object 6 has extent 0.098458, half-extent 0.049229.
           The remaining space on the surface is primarily in the Y-direction, above or below the current line of objects.
           Let's try to place object 6 at (0.0, 0.09).
           Collision with object 7 (center (0,0)):
           Min center distance (axis-aligned) for object 6 (half-extents 0.049229) with object 7 (half-extents 0.04935): 0.049229 + 0.04935 = 0.098579.
           If object 6 is at (0, 0.09), it is 0.09 units away from object 7's center. This is less than 0.098579, so it would collide with object 7.
           I need to place it further away. Let's try (0.0, 0.1).
           Collision with object 7: (0.0, 0.1) from (0,0) is 0.1 units. 0.1 > 0.098579, so this clears object 7.
           Collision with object 4 (center (0.09,0)):
           Min center distance for object 6 and object 4: 0.049229 + 0.049157 = 0.098386.
           Object 6 at (0, 0.1), Object 4 at (0.09, 0). Distance between centers is sqrt(0.09^2 + 0.1^2) = sqrt(0.0081 + 0.01) = sqrt(0.0181) = 0.1345.
           This distance (0.1345) is greater than 0.098386, so it clears object 4.
           Collision with object 5 (center (-0.09,0)):
           Min center distance for object 6 and object 5: 0.049229 + 0.04078 = 0.090009.
           Object 6 at (0, 0.1), Object 5 at (-0.09, 0). Distance between centers is sqrt((-0.09)^2 + 0.1^2) = sqrt(0.0081 + 0.01) = sqrt(0.0181) = 0.1345.
           This distance (0.1345) is greater than 0.090009, so it clears object 5.
           
           A placement at (0.0, 0.1) seems good.
           Let's also try (0.0, -0.1). By symmetry, this should also work.
           The surface bounds are [-0.135, 0.135].
           Object 6 at (0, 0.1) has Y-range [0.1 - 0.049229, 0.1 + 0.049229] = [0.050771, 0.149229].
           The upper bound 0.149229 is outside 0.135. This suggests the tolerance mentioned earlier. Since object 4 was accepted, I will generate placements slightly outside the explicit bounds and assume there is a tolerance or that the actual bounds are slightly larger.
           I will try to place it at (0.0, 0.09) and (0.0, -0.09) as well to be safer, considering the previous objects' half-extents. Object 7 has half-extent 0.04935. Object 6 has half-extent 0.049229. If object 6 is at (0, 0.09), its lower y-edge is 0.09 - 0.049229 = 0.040771. Object 7's upper y-edge is 0.04935. These still seem to collide along the Y-axis.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the collision condition. If a placement is successful, it means it was stable and didn't collide with fixed obstacles. The fixed obstacles include the previously placed objects.
           Object 7 (0, 0, 0.0, 0.0) -> x-range [-0.04935, 0.04935], y-range [-0.04935, 0.04935]
           Object 4 (0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.0) -> x-range [0.040843, 0.139157], y-range [-0.049157, 0.049157]
           Object 5 (0, 0.0, -0.09, 0.0) -> x-range [-0.130788, -0.049212], y-range [-0.040788, 0.040788]
           
           So far, the objects occupy the region:
           X: [-0.130788, 0.139157]
           Y: [-0.04935, 0.04935]
           This means the Y-axis is mostly clear for new objects, but the X-axis is quite crowded.
           
           Let's try (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1).
           Object 6 (ID 6, half_extents = 0.049229)
           Center (0, 0.1)
           vs Object 7 (ID 7, half_extents = 0.04935)
           Center (0,0). Collision if |dx| < sum_hx and |dy| < sum_hy.
           dx = 0, sum_hx = 0.049229 + 0.04935 = 0.098579. |dx| < sum_hx is true (0 < 0.098579).
           dy = 0.1, sum_hy = 0.049229 + 0.04935 = 0.098579. |dy| < sum_hy is false (0.1 > 0.098579). No collision with Object 7.
           
           vs Object 4 (ID 4, half_extents = 0.049157)
           Center (0.09,0).
           dx = 0.09, sum_hx = 0.049229 + 0.049157 = 0.098386. |dx| < sum_hx is true (0.09 < 0.098386).
           dy = 0.1, sum_hy = 0.049229 + 0.049157 = 0.098386. |dy| < sum_hy is false (0.1 > 0.098386). No collision with Object 4.
           
           vs Object 5 (ID 5, half_extents = 0.040788)
           Center (-0.09,0).
           dx = -0.09, sum_hx = 0.049229 + 0.040788 = 0.090017. |dx| < sum_hx is true (0.09 < 0.090017).
           dy = 0.1, sum_hy = 0.049229 + 0.040788 = 0.090017. |dy| < sum_hy is false (0.1 > 0.090017). No collision with Object 5.
           
           So (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1) looks like a stable and non-colliding placement, assuming the surface allows slightly exceeding its bounds. Let's try several similar positions.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface (0.27x0.27) at the origin.
           I have previously placed:
           Object 7 at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) with extent 0.0987. Half-extent 0.04935.
           Object 4 at (0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.0) with extent 0.0983. Half-extent 0.04915.
           Object 5 at (0, 0.0, -0.09, 0.0) with extent 0.0816. Half-extent 0.0408.
           
           And now, several placements for Object 6 (extent 0.098458, half-extent 0.049229) have been successful. These include:
           - (0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.09)
           - (0, 0.0, -0.09, 0.09)
           - (0, 0.0, 0.09, -0.09)
           - (0, 0.0, -0.09, -0.09)
           - Rotated versions of the above (theta=1.5707963267948966)
           - (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.09)
           - (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.09)
           - Rotated versions of the above (theta=1.5707963267948966)
           - (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07) (This is a new successful placement, which indicates my calculation of 0.1 for Y was likely too large for the surface bounds. Let's re-evaluate 0.07.)
           
           Failures indicate that the surface bounds are strictly adhered to (i.e., no tolerance for exceeding 0.135).
           Object 6 has half-extent 0.049229.
           So, max center coordinate for axis-aligned placement is 0.135 - 0.049229 = 0.085771.
           This explains why (0.0, 0.09) was stable (0.09 > 0.085771, but the bounds reported from failure messages for (0.0, 0.1) show AABB of ((-0.035, 0.065), (0.035, 0.135)). For an object of size ~0.098, its half size is ~0.049. If its center is at (0.0, 0.09), then the AABB is [0.0-0.049, 0.0+0.049] in x and [0.09-0.049, 0.09+0.049] in y. So [-0.049, 0.049] in X and [0.041, 0.139] in Y. The upper Y bound 0.139 is > 0.135, which should be a failure.
           
           However, the feedback states that:
           `(ID: 6) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1 is not stable, as the AABB of the object ((-0.035, 0.06500000149011612), (0.035, 0.13500000149011612)) is not contained in the AABB of the surface ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).`
           This implies that the object's half-extent is ~0.035.
           Let's check `0.09845843314249025 / 2 = 0.049229216571245125`. This is not 0.035.
           The AABB reported in the failure message for ID 6 `((-0.035, 0.06500000149011612), (0.035, 0.13500000149011612))` for a placement at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1)` means:
           lower_x = -0.035, upper_x = 0.035 => size_x = 0.07. This means the object is considered to have size 0.07 by the stability checker.
           lower_y = 0.065, upper_y = 0.135 => size_y = 0.07. This means the object is considered to have size 0.07 by the stability checker.
           This contradicts the given object extent `(0.09845843314249025, 0.09845843314249025)`.
           The problem description states "the geometry of the object will be described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)". The feedback seems to imply a different effective AABB for stability checks for ID 6.
           Let's assume the stability checker uses a smaller effective AABB for object 6, with half-extents of ~0.035.
           If object 6 has half-extents 0.035, then maximum center coordinate for axis-aligned placement is 0.135 - 0.035 = 0.1.
           This explains why (0.0, 0.1) caused its AABB upper_y to be 0.135, which is exactly on the boundary, and thus not stable if strict inequality is required.
           However, it also states that `(ID: 6) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.09` was a success.
           If half-extent is 0.035, then center (0, 0.09) means AABB is ((-0.035, 0.09-0.035), (0.035, 0.09+0.035)) = ((-0.035, 0.055), (0.035, 0.125)). This is contained within ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). This explains (0.0, 0.09) being a success.
           And (0.0, 0.07) was also a success. AABB for (0, 0.07) is ((-0.035, 0.035), (0.035, 0.105)). This is also contained.
           
           So, I will assume for object 6, the effective half-extent for stability is 0.035.
           Let's check collisions with other objects based on this assumption.
           Object 7: half-extent 0.04935.
           Object 4: half-extent 0.04915.
           Object 5: half-extent 0.0408.
           Object 6 (effective): half-extent 0.035.
           
           Available space based on effective half-extents:
           Object 7 (0,0) AABB: [-0.04935, 0.04935] x [-0.04935, 0.04935]
           Object 4 (0.09,0) AABB: [0.04085, 0.13915] x [-0.04915, 0.04915] - This object's X-range still exceeds 0.135, but it was successful, so I will continue to assume the surface itself allows a bit of overflow, or the definition of "contained" is slightly loose.
           Object 5 (-0.09,0) AABB: [-0.1308, -0.0492] x [-0.0408, 0.0408]
           
           New placements for Object 6 (effective half-extent 0.035):
           Maximum center coordinate for object 6 for stability: 0.135 - 0.035 = 0.1.
           However, if (0.0, 0.1) was not stable, it means the upper bound is strictly < 0.135. So the max Y for the center is < 0.1.
           Let's try 0.095 as a max for the center. Or stick to 0.09, since that was successful.
           
           Known objects occupy approximately:
           X: [-0.1308, 0.13915]
           Y: [-0.04935, 0.04935]
           
           Consider placing object 6 at (0.0, 0.0). This will collide with Object 7.
           Consider placing object 6 at (0.0, 0.09). This was successful.
           Consider placing object 6 at (0.0, -0.09). This was successful.
           Consider placing object 6 at (0.09, 0.09). This was successful.
           Consider placing object 6 at (-0.09, 0.09). This was successful.
           Consider placing object 6 at (0.09, -0.09). This was successful.
           Consider placing object 6 at (-0.09, -0.09). This was successful.
           
           I need new placements that are not yet provided.
           The previous set of successful placements for object 6 shows a pattern: corners (+-0.09, +-0.09) and midpoints of edges (0.0, +-0.09). This suggests there's some remaining space, even if the "true" extent of object 6 used for collision/stability is smaller than the declared one.
           
           Let's use the smaller effective half-extent (0.035) for collision and stability for object 6.
           Remaining Y region: [0.04935, 0.135] and [-0.135, -0.04935].
           Remaining X region (very small in the middle): [-0.0492, 0.04085]
           
           Let's try to place object 6 (half-extent 0.035) in the remaining Y space.
           Try placing it at X=0, but Y such that it doesn't collide with object 7.
           Object 7's AABB extends to Y=0.04935.
           Object 6 (0, Y_center) AABB extends to [Y_center-0.035, Y_center+0.035].
           For no collision with Object 7: Y_center - 0.035 >= 0.04935 => Y_center >= 0.08435.
           For stability: Y_center + 0.035 <= 0.135 => Y_center <= 0.1.
           And Y_center - 0.035 >= -0.135 => Y_center >= -0.1.
           
           So, for Y>0, valid range for Y_center is [0.08435, 0.1].
           For Y<0, valid range for Y_center is [-0.1, -0.08435].
           The previous success (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07) for ID 6 means Y_center = 0.07.
           This implies 0.07 - 0.035 = 0.035 (lower bound for ID 6) and 0.07 + 0.035 = 0.105 (upper bound for ID 6).
           This position (0, 0.07) means object 6 is inside the Y range of object 7 ([-0.04935, 0.04935]), so it should collide.
           Object 6 at (0, 0.07)
           Object 7 at (0,0)
           dx = 0, sum_hx = 0.035 + 0.04935 = 0.08435. |dx| < sum_hx (0 < 0.08435).
           dy = 0.07, sum_hy = 0.035 + 0.04935 = 0.08435. |dy| < sum_hy (0.07 < 0.08435).
           This implies a collision between object 6 at (0,0.07) and object 7 at (0,0).
           But (ID: 6) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07 was a success.
           
           This implies my understanding of the collision logic or the effective AABB sizes is inconsistent with the simulator.
           Given that (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07) and (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.09) were successes for Object 6, but (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1) was a failure (due to stability, not collision), it suggests the effective stability AABB for object 6 is indeed such that its max extent is 0.135 (surface upper bound) when its center is at 0.1, but for some reason, 0.09 is fine.
           If a center at 0.1 results in an upper bound of 0.135, then the half-extent is 0.035.
           If the upper bound must be strictly less than 0.135, then max center is 0.135 - 0.035 = 0.1.
           But then (0.0, 0.1) should have been stable if strict inequality on boundary is not enforced, or just barely fail if it is. The error message shows 0.135 as the upper Y for the object.
           
           I will proceed by generating diverse placements in the regions that have previously shown success for object 6 (e.g., around +-0.09 in X and +-0.09 in Y), and some new variations. The exact limits are fuzzy due to the conflicting information from object extents and failure messages. I will prioritize places that are clearly not overlapping the *successful* placements of objects 7, 4, 5.
           
           Object 7: (0,0)
           Object 4: (0.09,0)
           Object 5: (-0.09,0)
           Object 6 successes:
           (0.09, 0.09), (-0.09, 0.09), (0.09, -0.09), (-0.09, -0.09) (and rotated)
           (0.0, 0.09), (0.0, -0.09) (and rotated)
           (0.0, 0.07)
           
           Let's try to fill the remaining clear space, particularly the Y-axis.
           The Y-axis is quite crowded with (0,0.09), (0,-0.09) and (0,0.07). The only "empty" space on Y-axis is between 0.07 and 0.09, or close to (0,0) but not overlapping.
           Since (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07) was a success, and it *should* collide with ID 7 if using listed extents, I will try to place object 6 very close to the edges of the other objects, with smaller steps.
           
           Let's assume the success (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07) means object 6 at (0,0.07) does not collide with object 7 at (0,0). This implies a very small or no effective collision box for object 6. This is unlikely to be the general case. I'll stick to the idea that objects have their given extents, and the effective half-extent of ID 6 for stability is 0.035 (from the failure messages). And the "contained" rule is strict inequality.
           So max center coordinate is (0.135 - 0.035) = 0.1.
           But (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1) failed. This implies it's `upper_bound < 0.135`, not `upper_bound <= 0.135`.
           So for ID 6, the center coordinates in X or Y must be within `(-0.135 + 0.035, 0.135 - 0.035) = (-0.1, 0.1)`.
           So, for the center, the range is strictly `(-0.1, 0.1)`.
           This makes (0,0.09) and (0,0.07) valid for stability.
           
           Now, let's recheck collision for (0,0.07) with Object 7 (center 0,0, half_extent 0.04935).
           Object 6 (effective half_extent 0.035).
           Center (0,0.07). dx=0, dy=0.07.
           sum_hx = 0.035 + 0.04935 = 0.08435. (0 < 0.08435)
           sum_hy = 0.035 + 0.04935 = 0.08435. (0.07 < 0.08435)
           These conditions mean a collision. So why was it a success? This is confusing.
           
           I will ignore my internal collision logic for (0,0.07) vs (0,0) and trust the success.
           Let's try filling in the space between (0.0, 0.07) and (0.0, 0.09) with (0.0, 0.08).
           For Object 6 (effective half-extent 0.035):
           Center (0.0, 0.08)
           AABB: ((-0.035, 0.08-0.035), (0.035, 0.08+0.035)) = ((-0.035, 0.045), (0.035, 0.115)). This is within surface.
           Collision with Object 7 (0,0, half-extent 0.04935):
           dx=0, dy=0.08. sum_hx=0.08435, sum_hy=0.08435.
           (0 < 0.08435) and (0.08 < 0.08435) => Collision.
           So (0,0.08) should collide with object 7, but (0,0.07) did not. This means there is some tolerance or specific geometry that I am not modeling.
           
           I will focus on placing objects in the areas confirmed as successful or very similar to them.
           If (0.0, 0.09) and (0.0, 0.07) are successful, it suggests a small band of safe Y values around 0.08.
           Given the confusion, I will revert to a simpler strategy of picking locations that are likely to be far enough and within the surface.
           Since the corners (0.09, 0.09) were successful, I will use slight variations of those.
           I will use the *declared* object extents for my internal collision checks (0.098458), and the *derived* effective half-extent for stability (0.035) and max center coord (0.095 or 0.1, based on the previous (0,0.1) failure, let's target 0.09).
           This is very confusing, but I have to try.
           Let's use 0.09 for boundary checks on placement centers and the declared extent for collision checks against other objects.
           
           Object 6 extent: 0.098458, half-extent 0.049229.
           If center is (x,y), then max(abs(x), abs(y)) + half_extent <= 0.135 (for axis aligned)
           max(abs(x), abs(y)) + 0.049229 <= 0.135
           max(abs(x), abs(y)) <= 0.135 - 0.049229 = 0.085771.
           This implies my previous successful placements like (0.09, 0.09) and (0.0, 0.09) *should have failed stability*.
           This contradicts the success cases. The only way to reconcile this is if the *effective* half-extent used for stability is indeed 0.035 for object 6, which would mean `max(abs(x), abs(y)) <= 0.135 - 0.035 = 0.1`.
           Given (0,0.1) failed for stability (AABB upper Y was 0.135), it means it must be strictly less than 0.1. So maybe max center coordinate is 0.0999. I will use 0.09 for safety, as that was a successful value.
           
           So, I will assume for ID 6:
           1. Max center absolute coordinate for stability is 0.09.
           2. For collision with *other* objects (ID 7, 4, 5), use the declared extent (0.098458, half=0.049229).
           3. For collision with *other instances of ID 6*, also use the declared extent.
           
           Let's try to place a new object 6 around the corners.
           Object 7 (0,0), Object 4 (0.09,0), Object 5 (-0.09,0).
           Successful Object 6 placements:
           (0.09, 0.09)
           (-0.09, 0.09)
           (0.09, -0.09)
           (-0.09, -0.09)
           (0.0, 0.09)
           (0.0, -0.09)
           (0.0, 0.07)
           
           Let's try intermediate positions.
           Try (0.0, 0.05).
           Collision with 7 (0,0, hx=0.04935, hy=0.04935) and 6 (0.05, hx=0.049229, hy=0.049229).
           dx = 0, dy = 0.05.
           sum_hx = 0.04935 + 0.049229 = 0.098579. (0 < 0.098579).
           sum_hy = 0.04935 + 0.049229 = 0.098579. (0.05 < 0.098579).
           This should be a collision. Yet, 0.07 was a success. The collision rule for ID 6 seems to be very lenient, or based on a smaller object size when checking against ID 7.
           
           This is highly ambiguous. I will proceed by generating diverse placements within the overall surface boundaries, prioritizing the empty spaces, and avoiding explicitly known collision regions by the successes and failures.
           The pattern of successes for ID 6 suggests that an object placed at (0, Y) such that 0.07 <= Y <= 0.09 (or the negative equivalents) is acceptable.
           Also, the corners are fine.
           The overall layout is like a cross or plus sign on the X and Y axes, and the four corners.
           Empty spaces are essentially in the 'quadrants' that are not covered by the current successful placements.
           
           Let's try varying X or Y slightly from existing successful placements, or positions in the diagonal.
           Current successful placements for objects 4,5,6,7 cover a good portion of the main surface area, mostly forming a grid.
           Object 7: (0,0)
           Object 4: (0.09,0)
           Object 5: (-0.09,0)
           Object 6: (0,0.09), (0,-0.09), (0.09,0.09), (0.09,-0.09), (-0.09,0.09), (-0.09,-0.09), (0,0.07), and rotations.
           
           Let's try to place an object at (0.07, 0.0). This would be similar to how (0.0, 0.07) worked, but along the X axis.
           This will collide with Object 7 (0,0) and Object 4 (0.09,0). This should be a failure.
           
           I will try to find positions between the existing successful Object 6 placements in the corners, or slightly inside them.
           For example, (0.05, 0.05) or (0.07, 0.07).
