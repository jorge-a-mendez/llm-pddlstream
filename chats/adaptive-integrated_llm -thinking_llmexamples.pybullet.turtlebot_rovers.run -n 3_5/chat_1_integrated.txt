           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Initial Thoughts and Planning to Achieve the Goal new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. I need to achieve this new axiom, and it looks like it involves getting images and performing analyses. Let's break it down:
           
           First, I see the conditions involve getting images of three objects (v17, v18, v19) using "receivedimage". To get those images, I'll need a rover, camera, and communication system. I'll use rover v12 since it's free and onboard a camera. I can use the move action to get there. I'll need to calibrate the camera and take an image, then communicate it to the lander, v9, via the actions.
           
           After getting the images, I also see two other goals: analyzing soil and stone samples and sending the analysis. Rover v14 will be used for that, since it is also free and has a store for the samples. It needs to get to the samples, take a sample, and communicate the sample to the lander. I need to ensure rover's locations are at their starting positions as stated in the axiom.
           
           **Key Rover Actions**
           *   **Move:** Rovers will move to the required places.
           *   **Calibrate and Take Image:** This applies to rover v12.
           *   **Sample Rock:** This applies to v14.
           *   **Send Image and Send Analysis:** Both rover actions will be communication actions.
           
           *   To get images, I can use a rover v12. The idea is to move the rover to an ideal configuration (#o3) where it can see all three objects (v17, v18, v19).
           
           *   To analyze and send the samples, I can move rover v14 to analyze the rock to sample them and send it to the lander.
           
           For this to work, I need to ensure that the images are clear, I need the communication channel to work between the two locations, I need the stores to be working.
           
           **Important Considerations**
           
           *   **Continuous Parameters**: I need to define the positions of the configuration parameters, #o3 (for imaging), #o0 (for communication) with (x,y) coordinates.
           *   **Image Visibility and Communcation Visibility:** The `imagevisible` predicates and `comvisible` predicates will determine the placement and I can work on the coordinates.
           *   **Samples:** Rover can only store one sample at a time. After it takes the first sample, the rover needs to send the sample to make room for another sample.
           *   **Returning Locations:** Once sampling and image actions are complete, the rovers need to be at their starting positions.
           
           I'm confident I can make this work!

           *   **Image Visibility and Communcation Visibility:** The `imagevisible` predicates and `comvisible` predicates will determine the placement and I can work on the coordinates.
           *   **Samples:** Rover can only store one sample at a time. After it takes the first sample, the rover needs to send the sample to make room for another sample.
           *   **Returning Locations:** Once sampling and image actions are complete, the rovers need to be at their starting positions.
           
           I'm confident I can make this work!

(Thoughts: **A Revised Strategy for a Multi-Objective Mission**
           
           Okay, after reviewing the feedback, I need to adjust my approach. The key challenge lies in finding configurations (`#o3` and `#o0`) that are *both* reachable and satisfy the visibility and communication constraints for the rovers.
           
           Initially, I had selected configurations based on Euclidean distances and visibility. However, the system feedback consistently rejected configurations that seemed reachable from my calculations. This strongly suggests that there are unstated constraints or obstacles affecting the rovers' movement.
           
           Here's the new approach, considering the constraints and feedback:
           
           1.  **Re-evaluating Configurations:**
           
               *   `#o3`: Given that a single configuration must serve for all three image targets (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`), and considering the close proximity, `(-0.7, 0.5)` looks viable, despite previous 'reachability' issues. To improve this, I'll align the rovers heading towards their goals. Theta (orientation) of `#o3` is set to `1.57` (90 degrees, +Y) as most of the image target coordinates are at a greater Y than the rover.
               *   `#o0`: For communication, `(-0.8, -1.75)` seems a suitable choice because it is near the initial and final locations of `v14` in the -X direction and close to the lander. The theta (orientation) of `#o0` will be set to `3.14` (180 degrees, -X), oriented towards communication with the lander.
           
           2.  **Rover Roles:** I'll stick with the plan of `v14` handling imaging, stone, and soil analysis and `v12` working with the stone.  `v14` will complete all objectives.
           
           3.  **Detailed Plan:**
           
               *   Rover `v14`:
                   1.  Move to `#o3` (`(-0.7, 0.5, 1.57)`) to image
                   2.  Take images of `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`.
                   3.  Move to `#o0` (`(-0.8, -1.75, 3.14)`) for communication.
                   4.  Move to `#o5` for soil sample.
                   5.  Communicate soil analysis.
                   6.  Drop the samples.
                   7.  Return to starting location.
               *   Rover `v12`:
                   1.  Move to `#o5` for the stone sample.
                   2.  Move to `#o0` to communicate stone analysis.
                   3.  Drop the sample.
                   4.  Return to its starting location.
           
           4.  **Assumptions and Justifications:**
           
               *   Reachability: I am proceeding with the assumption that the `motion` predicates in the initial state mean paths exist for all required rover movements, even if they appear problematic based on simple Euclidean distance. I will account for orientation.
               *   Multi-Objective Imaging: A single `#o3` configuration is essential for each image objective to meet the plan. It's the core condition.
           
           This is a robust solution with all considerations that fit well with the existing data.

User:      Configuration #o0 = (-0.8 -1.75 3.14) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Plan for Enhanced Reachability and Communication**
           
           Okay, so the last plan failed due to `v12` having trouble reaching configuration `#o0` for the communication step. We need to get both rovers communicating with the lander `v9`, but ensure we get there without any more issues. I've re-examined the goals, focusing on the reachability of these continuous parameters. The core problem is that `v12` needs to get to a point where it can see the lander to send its data, and it wasn't able to get there.
           
           The key is that both rovers must return to their initial positions. Both rovers *could* communicate and image. I need to make sure the continuous parameter `#o0` (the target communication point) is reachable for each rover. Also I need to satisfy the other goals: Both rovers must be in their starting positions, both store compartments should be free.
           
           Let's carefully pick the coordinates for communication poses, remembering we've seen a straight-line distance of 1.8 units, wasn't the sole problem. The PDDL problem states that if I am using `imagevisible` or `comvisible`, I need to specify the `(x, y)` coordinate, while other continuous parameters don't have to be specified.
           
           **Refining Rover Poses for Optimal Communication:**
           
           **Rover `v12` - Stone Sampling & Communication**
           *   **Original problem:** `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)` and it couldn't reach `(-0.8, -1.75)` for the previous communication step. I will use a different position, `(0.5, -1.8)`, for `#o0`, to maintain communication with `v9`. This is *closer* to `v12`'s starting position which *should* resolve the reachability issue and still be within communication range of `v9`. Distance to `(0.5, -1.8)` is around 0.5 units which *should* resolve the initial reachability issues. Distance from `(0.5, -1.8)` to `v9` is around 2.4 units, which is great.
           
           **Rover `v14` - Image-Taking, Soil Analysis, and Communication:**
           *   **No issues communicating.** `(-0.8, -1.75)` was not an issue as `v14` is near this pose. So I am going to try and reuse this.
           
           I am *not* going to reuse any images, but will assume I have to do this afresh.
           
           **My Plan:**
           
           I'll break the plan into two phases.
           
           **Phase 1: Rover `v14` - Imaging and Analysis:**
           
           1.  `v14` starts from `(1.0, -1.75)`, goes to an imaging point. Distance is 2.27, which seems reasonable.
           2.  `v14` takes images of targets `v17, v18, v19`. Distance is ~1.6, ~1.8, ~1.9.
           3.  `v14` goes to `(-1.0, -2.0)`. This should be easily reachable.
           4.  `v14` sends images.
           5.  `v14` goes to the sampling point for `v5`.
           6.  `v14` samples `v5`.
           7.  `v14` goes back to `(-1.0, -2.0)` to communicate again.
           8.  `v14` sends its analysis.
           9.  `v14` drops its payload and returns to its start state `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           **Phase 2: Rover `v12` - Stone Analysis and Communication**
           
           1.  `v12` goes to the sampling spot.
           2.  `v12` samples `v4`.
           3.  `v12` goes to its `(-0.5, -1.8)` communication position.
           4.  `v12` sends its analysis.
           5.  `v12` drops its payload and returns to its start.
           
           This should *work*! Each rover is able to communicate and each rover's movements are relatively short.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating Reachability and Refining the Plan**
           
           Okay, so the previous configurations failed, particularly for `v12` communicating with `v9`.  My job now is to figure out new, feasible configurations. I'm starting from the goal, checking my assumptions, and trying to learn from what went wrong last time.
           
           The core goal is still the same: get the rovers to analyze and send information back.  I need to get *both* rovers to communicate with the lander (`v9`). The key challenge is finding a communication configuration for `v12` that's actually reachable.  The old configuration `(0.5, -1.8, 3.14)` didn't work, so I'm looking for an improvement.
           
           Here's the new plan: I'll stick with the imaging and soil analysis strategy for `v14`. I'm going to start with a new `v12` configuration.
           
           Let's begin by reviewing the imaging plan, since `v14` will be executing it first. I need to make sure that the image configurations are still good and within visibility range.
           I will begin with `v14`. The existing configuration for `v14` (imaging) has these values:
           -   `#o3 = (-0.7, 0.5)`
           This is within range for the objects.
           The next step is to examine `v14`'s final configuration which enables it to communicate with the lander. The current setup is:
           -   `#o0 = (-1.0, -2.0)`.
           This configuration also satisfies the visibility condition.
           
           I need to re-evaluate the communications plan for `v12` to `v9`. 
           The major problem is the unreachable previous configuration. Let's see what we can do to fix this:
           -   `v9` is at  `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           -   `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           I'm starting at `v12`, and making sure it has a valid pose (via the motion predicates) to communicate with `v9`.  
           -   Let's try: `(0.0, -2.0)`.
           This seems to work and is close to the start, which helps!
           -   The new `#o0` for `v12` is  `(0.0, -2.0, 3.14)`.
           
           Now, for stone analysis by `v12`. I need to figure out where the `above` pose is for `v4`, the stone. I'm choosing a pose of `(-1.5, -0.7)`. This is a reasonable choice and the motion predicate between the previous and this location is valid.
           
           I'm keeping the poses that were already working well for `v14`:
           -   `#o5 = (1.7, -0.9, 0.0)`  (soil)
           -   `#o5 = (-1.5, -0.7, 0.0)`  (stone)
           
           **Revised Plan:**
           
           **Rover `v14` (Imaging and Soil Analysis):**
           1.  `move v14 v15 #o2 #o3`  (to pose `(-0.7, 0.5)`)
           2.  ... (and subsequent imaging actions) ...
           3.  `move v14 #o3 #o2 #o0` (to comm pose `(-1.0, -2.0)`)
           4.  ... (and subsequent communication actions) ...
           5.  `move v14 #o0 #o2 #o5` (to pose  `(1.7, -0.9)`)
           6.  `sample_rock v14 #o5 v5 v16`
           7.  ... (and other actions, until) ...
           8.  `move v14 #o0 #o2 v15` (return to home)
           
           **Rover `v12` (Stone Analysis):**
           1.  `move v12 v13 #o2 #o5` (to pose `(-1.5, -0.7)`)
           2.  `sample_rock v12 #o5 v4 v16`
           3.  `move v12 #o5 #o2 #o0` (to comm pose `(0.0, -2.0)`)
           4.  ... (and subsequent analysis) ...
           5.  `move v12 #o0 #o2 v

           This configuration also satisfies the visibility condition.
           
           I need to re-evaluate the communications plan for `v12` to `v9`. 
           The major problem is the unreachable previous configuration. Let's see what we can do to fix this:
           -   `v9` is at  `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           -   `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           I'm starting at `v12`, and making sure it has a valid pose (via the motion predicates) to communicate with `v9`.  
           -   Let's try: `(0.0, -2.0)`.
           This seems to work and is close to the start, which helps!
           -   The new `#o0` for `v12` is  `(0.0, -2.0, 3.14)`.
           
           Now, for stone analysis by `v12`. I need to figure out where the `above` pose is for `v4`, the stone. I'm choosing a pose of `(-1.5, -0.7)`. This is a reasonable choice and the motion predicate between the previous and this location is valid.
           
           I'm keeping the poses that were already working well for `v14`:
           -   `#o5 = (1.7, -0.9, 0.0)`  (soil)
           -   `#o5 = (-1.5, -0.7, 0.0)`  (stone)
           
           **Revised Plan:**
           
           **Rover `v14` (Imaging and Soil Analysis):**
           1.  `move v14 v15 #o2 #o3`  (to pose `(-0.7, 0.5)`)
           2.  ... (and subsequent imaging actions) ...
           3.  `move v14 #o3 #o2 #o0` (to comm pose `(-1.0, -2.0)`)
           4.  ... (and subsequent communication actions) ...
           5.  `move v14 #o0 #o2 #o5` (to pose  `(1.7, -0.9)`)
           6.  `sample_rock v14 #o5 v5 v16`
           7.  ... (and other actions, until) ...
           8.  `move v14 #o0 #o2 v15` (return to home)
           
           **Rover `v12` (Stone Analysis):**
           1.  `move v12 v13 #o2 #o5` (to pose `(-1.5, -0.7)`)
           2.  `sample_rock v12 #o5 v4 v16`
           3.  `move v12 #o5 #o2 #o0` (to comm pose `(0.0, -2.0)`)
           4.  ... (and subsequent analysis) ...
           5.  `move v12 #o0 #o2 v

(Thoughts: **Configuration Re-Evaluation and Refinement**
           
           Okay, so the communication configuration for v12, `(0.0, -2.0, 3.14)`, is colliding with obstacle v20. We need to find a new, collision-free configuration for v12 to communicate with the lander v9, while ensuring our imaging and sampling strategy still holds.
           
           The primary goal remains the same: complete the `new-axiom@0()`, which encompasses both imaging and analysis. The existing assignment of imaging and soil analysis to v14, and stone analysis to v12, makes intuitive sense and doesn't require revision. The key is in those collision-free configurations.
           
           **Obstacle Analysis and Revised Configurations**
           
           Obstacle v20 is a long, thin vertical barrier, centered around X=0. The previous communication point was exactly on that X=0 axis, leading to the collision. We need to shift `v12`'s configuration.
           
           For **imaging** (v14): The current configuration `(-0.7, 0.5, 1.57)` appears acceptable. It's outside the problematic X range of the obstacle, and the distances to the imaging targets (v17, v18, v19) are within range. It's reachable from the starting point v15.
           
           The **communication configuration for v14** `#o0` can remain as `(-1.0, -2.0, 3.14)`. It's collision-free, within communication range of the lander v9, and reachable.
           
           **Sampling Configurations** (`#o5`): Specific (x, y) coordinates aren't needed, but reasonable points for sampling are: `(1.7, -0.9)` for soil (v5) and `(-1.5, -0.7)` for stone (v4).
           
           **Crucially, we need to revise `v12`'s communication configuration `(#o0)`:**
           
           *   We need to find a new point that avoids v20.
           *   It must be within communication range of the lander (v9).
           *   It must be reachable from v13 (its starting point), and ideally, reachable from the sampling location for the stone (v4, which will be near the `-1.5, -0.7`).
           
           Let's try **`#o0 = (0.2, -2.0, 3.14)`**. This is outside the obstacle's X-range. The lander is still within communication range. This point is reachable from the starting point of v12 (v13), and also the sampling location for stone (v4).
           
           Therefore, with this new `(#o0)` configuration for `v12`, the plan can proceed without modification to the general structure.

(Thoughts: **Refined Plan for New Axiom Execution**
           
           Okay, here's my updated thinking on achieving `new-axiom@0()`, focusing on those pesky collision concerns. My goal is to orchestrate a plan where two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, complete their tasks, with no more unexpected hiccups.  I've got the goal conditions: `v12` and `v14` in their end configurations, both stores free, images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19` received, and the analyses of `v4` and `v5` done.
           
           The biggest issue is `v20`, that obstacle. That AABB is clearly causing problems, specifically with where `v12` can be. The x-coordinate range (-0.05, 0.05) is off-limits. I need to re-evaluate the communication configurations, focusing on the `#o0` configuration for `v12`. I need to be *sure* this time.
           
           **My Plan:**
           
           *   **v14 (Imaging & Soil):** First, I'll direct `v14` to a good imaging spot (`#o3`), around (-0.7, 0.5), to capture those images of objectives `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`. I've checked distances and that spot is reachable. Next, it'll move to a communication position near the lander (`#o0`). I think `(-1.0, -2.0)` should be okay, and is definitely reachable from the imaging position. This allows for communication with the lander `v9`.  Then,  `v14` will go to `#o5`, likely near (1.7, -0.9), to grab a soil sample (`v5`). Once that's done, I'll have it move back to `#o0` and send the analyses, then return to its start position.
           
           *   **v12 (Stone):** This is where it gets tricky. `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`. I want it to take a soil sample for `v4` near (-1.5, -0.7). But it *must* communicate with the lander. The communication point (#o0) is the real challenge. I *need* to pick an x-coordinate for `v12`'s `#o0` communication position that is NOT within the obstacle's range. I'm going to try `(0.6, -2.0)`. This seems safe because it's further away from the obstacle.  It's definitely reachable from its start and is well within the 4-unit communication radius. Once that soil sample is taken, I'll send the analyses via `#o0` and return to the starting position.
           
           **Verification:**
           
           I re-checked the plan steps, making sure the moves and actions are in the right order. This looks good. It covers all the goals, and the communication and analysis steps are there. I just need to verify that `(0.6, -2.0)` *really* is collision-free and that the movement sequences work as intended. The path planning should now go smoothly with this new approach.
