           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unreachable Goal: A Deep Dive into the Rovers Domain**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with devising a plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()` in this *rovers* domain. First things first, I break down the goal: it boils down to achieving three things: getting images of objects `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`, as well as analyzing soil and stone samples. The catch? The robots *must* remain in their initial configurations, `v12` at `v13` and `v14` at `v15`.
           
           The initial state hands me a few satisfied conditions: the rovers are where they need to be, and their stores are free. But, I've got to ensure the necessary images get received, and that the analysis of stone and soil samples gets back.
           
           So I look at all the actions available: `move`, `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`, and `drop_rock`. Based on the goal conditions, I know I'll be focusing on the imaging and analysis actions. I need to get those images to lander `v9`, and the analysis data back from the samples I collect.
           
           Then, there's the issue of the "#" objects. These are *crucial*. They represent continuous parameters - think configurations and trajectories. The problem says if a "#" object is tied to `imagevisible` or `comvisible`, I have to specify a value for it. Crucially, the problem states that I have to use them if I can, or if there is no other path in the initial state. Well, the problem sets the stage. There are `imagevisible` predicates, with `v17, v18, and v19` as the targets. And `conf(v12, #o3)` and `conf(v14, #o3)` are in the initial state with `imagevisible` predicates. Also, `conf(v12, #o0)` and `conf(v14, #o0)` are also initial state predicates with `comvisible` predicates. However, the problem wants me to retain the initial `atconf` location, as well.
           
           The first step is `calibrate` then `take_image`. Then to meet the goal, I have to `send_image`. The `take_image` has a crucial precondition, `imagevisible`, but with it, a distance limit of 2 units. The initial configuration is `atconf(v12, v13)` and the distance from `v13` to all objects is way greater than the distance. So, here's where the problem really bites me: The problem says that rovers must stay at `v13` and `v15`. So, given that the robots can't *move* to get closer, those image targets are always outside the camera range. No image can be acquired.
           
           I calculated the distances, and it's a no-go. No matter the configuration, with all of them greater than 2, I can't even get started. I did calculations for both rovers, from both of their fixed starting points, just to be sure. I'm hitting a roadblock. So, to be super clear:
           
           *   The goal requires those images.
           *   The `imagevisible` predicate is tied to a 2-unit limit.
           *   Because the rovers have to stay put, I can't meet that range requirement and the images are unreachable.
           
           Thus the goal is unsolvable.
