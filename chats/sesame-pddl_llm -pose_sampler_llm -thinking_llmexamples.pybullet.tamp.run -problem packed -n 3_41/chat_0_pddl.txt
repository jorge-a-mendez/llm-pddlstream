(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object 4 on Surface 0**
           
           My initial thought is to secure 50 stable placements for object ID 4, a nearly square object with dimensions approximately 0.09 x 0.09 meters, on surface 0, a square surface spanning from -0.135 to 0.135 meters in both x and y directions, centered at (0, 0).  The core challenge is ensuring each placement is stable, meaning the object is fully contained within the surface, regardless of its rotation.
           
           The object's dimensions are described in terms of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB). When rotated by an angle *θ*, its world-aligned AABB's dimensions will change.  Specifically, the new width (*W*) and height (*H*) of this bounding box can be determined using the object's original dimensions (*obj_w*, *obj_h*) and the rotation angle *θ*:
           
           *W = obj_w * |cos(θ)| + obj_h * |sin(θ)|*
           *H = obj_w * |sin(θ)| + obj_h * |cos(θ)|*
           
           Given the object is nearly a square, *W* and *H* will be similar. At *θ = pi/4*, *W* and *H* reach their maximum size, approximately sqrt(2) * 0.09 = 0.127.
           
           To ensure stability, the object's center must be within a region that accounts for its rotated size.  For the worst-case scenario (largest rotated bounding box), I calculate the maximum allowable center coordinates. If the object’s dimensions after rotation is at their largest possible size W_max, which is 0.127. Then maximum allowable `x` coordinate and `y` coordinate for placement is 0.135 - 0.127/2 = 0.071, from -0.071 to 0.071, which allows for stable placement.
           
           Considering these constraints and leveraging the fact that the surface is large enough relative to the object's potential rotated footprint, I've decided to employ a straightforward yet effective strategy. My plan involves selecting a diverse set of angles (`θ`) and positioning the object's center at (0, 0) for each angle. Specifically, I'll use 50 evenly spaced angles from 0 to 2π. This allows for diverse orientations. Since the object comfortably fits at its largest size, (0, 0) will be a valid position for every angle from the set of 50.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement for Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a new square-ish object (Object 5) on a square surface.  I know a previous object (Object 4) is already placed on the same surface, centered at (0,0). I need to ensure that Object 5 doesn't collide with Object 4.
           
           My initial analysis reveals the surface and Object 5 have dimensions of roughly 0.27 and 0.086 respectively.  Object 4 has a side length of about 0.09.  I've done the math to figure out the allowed area for Object 5, even considering its possible rotation (0.074 units from the center, for any rotation).
           
           Now, the collision aspect... Placing Object 5 at the center (0,0) will cause a direct collision with Object 4.  So, I need to shift it.  If I consider just one orientation (theta=0), I can shift Object 5 to the edges and calculate collision-free placements.  By shifting it 0.09 units along the x or y-axis.  But this simple approach won't work once I consider rotations. 
           
           The most conservative and reliable approach is to consider the maximum rotated dimensions of Object 5 (effectively making it a circle of radius about 0.06), and then check for non-overlapping AABBs.
           
           After some rigorous calculations, I realize that it's going to be difficult, if not impossible, to guarantee collision-free placements for *any* rotation, specifically around angles of pi/4. There's a "forbidden" zone around the central placement of Object 4 due to the interaction of the bounding boxes.  
           
           I will need to be smart to provide the 50 placements. I'll need to focus on angles where I can guarantee it and avoid areas of the object.  I can divide up angles into safe and unsafe ranges.  I can find the angles from `0` to 0.05 and a similar zone on all quadrants where collision is safe. I will choose angles only from these smaller zones to avoid these problems and maximize the area for placement. The formula will be: 
           For each `theta`:
           1.  Calculate `w_curr`, `h_curr`, `wh_curr`, `hh_curr`.
           2.  Calculate surface bounds: `x_s_min`, `x_s_max`, `y_s_min`, `y_s_max`.
           3.  Calculate collision thresholds: `x_coll_thresh`, `y_coll_thresh`.
           A) Try `x = x_s_max`. If `x_s_max >= x_coll_thresh`:
              `y = (y_s_min + y_s_max) / 2.0`. This is a valid `(x, y)` and ensures `abs(x) >= x_coll_thresh`. Add `(0, theta, x, y)`.
           So, I'll generate the 50 placements, calculating for each theta.  I'll then determine a range.  This should provide stable, collision-free placements for Object 5!

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's break this down.**  My goal is to find 50 stable positions for a new object (ID 6) on a square surface (Surface 0). I've got to carefully avoid any collisions with the objects already in place: Object 4 (centered at (0,0)) and Object 5 (positioned in the top-right). It's all about ensuring Object 6 fits snugly and safely within Surface 0.
           
           **The Landscape:**
           Surface 0 is a square,  with each side 0.27 long and center at (0,0). Object 4 is almost a square and occupies the center of the surface at (0,0) ([-0.04498, 0.04498] x [-0.04498, 0.04498] for it's AABB). Object 5, also nearly a square, sits in the top-right corner.
           
           **Object 6, Our New Contender:**
           It's similar in size to the existing objects. Its dimensions will get larger depending on it's rotation from pi/2 or 0 or multiples of these. I need to figure out where it *can* go without bumping into anything.
           
           **The Rules of the Game:**
           1.  **Stay Within the Lines:** Object 6 must stay within Surface 0.
           2.  **No Bumping:**  Object 6 cannot collide with Object 4 or Object 5.
           
           **The Strategy:**
           I'm zeroing in on placing Object 6 in safe areas: specifically, the bottom-left, top-left, and bottom-right corners of Surface 0, taking object 4 and object 5 into account.
           
           *   To calculate 50 placement points, I need to limit the range of possible angles to place them: The dimensions of object 6 *abs(cos(theta)) + * abs(sin(theta)) is <= 0.09002. This results to be around delta = 0.030 radians from multiples of pi/2.
           *   Once this safe delta is calculated, there are three regions of interest (BL, TL, BR). Angles generated. Placements calculated for Object 6
           
           **The Bottom Line:**
           I'm confident that this approach will yield 50 stable, collision-free placements for Object 6.
