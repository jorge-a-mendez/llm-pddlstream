           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes three graspable objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`. They are currently at specific poses: `v8` at `v9`, `v12` at `v13`, and `v14` at `v15`. All three are supported by `v11`. The goal is to place all three objects on `v16`.
           
           The initial state indicates that the robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both are handempty. The robot's base is at `v3`.
           
           However, the only allowed action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action moves the robot's base from `v3` to `v3` (i.e., it doesn't actually move) and consumes the `canmove()` predicate. This action does not directly help in picking, placing, cleaning, or cooking any objects.
           
           To achieve the goal of `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`, the robot needs to perform `pick` and `place` actions for each of these objects. The `pick` action requires a `kin` predicate and the `place` action also requires a `kin` predicate. These `kin` predicates involve continuous parameters (poses, grasps, trajectories) which are not provided in the initial state or within the allowed action instances. Specifically, there are no `pick` or `place` action instances available.
           
           Therefore, with only `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` available as an action, it is impossible to pick up `v8`, `v12`, or `v14` from their current locations on `v11` and place them on `v16`. The goal is unreachable.
