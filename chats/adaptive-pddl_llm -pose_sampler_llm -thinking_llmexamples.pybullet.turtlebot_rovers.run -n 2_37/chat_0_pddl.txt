           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of Achieving new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunction demanding specific image and analysis receipts. My focus narrows immediately to how to generate these receipts.  The key predicates I need to satisfy are `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           To get the images, I'd rely on the `take_image` and `send_image` actions. To send a good image, I first must achieve having one. `take_image` hinges on `atconf(?v, ?q)` which is met, but so is  `imagevisible(?v, #o3, #o4, v17)`. My analysis of the preconditions shows that  my available rovers, `v12` and `v14`, must be positioned in a configuration where they can "see" these targets. Currently, `v12` is at configuration `v13` and `v14` at `v15` which is in no way similar to the visible configuration `#o3` required. The only available moves are no-ops.
           
           The situation mirrors the image analysis: `sample_rock` to get the analysis, then sending it. Yet again, the crucial precondition is `atconf(?v, ?q)`, where the rovers are stationed `above` the target rocks. Initial state, no matter, as `atconf` positions for both rovers are not close to the configurations needed to access any of the targets.
           
           So, I'm faced with a critical obstacle: **the rovers' inability to change their configuration**. The `move` actions I can use result in no change. I am dead in the water because I can't generate the required `imagevisible` and `above` conditions. My only conclusion is that the goal is unattainable with the given actions and the initial state.
