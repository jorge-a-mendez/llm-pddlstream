(Thoughts: **My Reasoning for Stable Object Placement**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5) on a single surface (surface 0).  The object is nearly square (dimensions ~0.094 x 0.094), and the surface is a square of size 0.27 x 0.27 centered at the origin.
           
           My approach is straightforward: since the object's dimensions are almost equal, orientation won't significantly affect its AABB within the surface. Therefore, I'll use a fixed rotation of 0 radians (no rotation) for all placements to simplify calculations. I'll need to calculate the allowable placement region to maintain full containment.
           
           Given the surface dimensions and object size, I've determined that the center of the object must fall within a smaller, inner square. To ensure this, I calculate the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates for this inner square by subtracting the object's half-width and half-height from the surface limits.
           
           I'll generate a grid of x and y coordinates within this valid inner square, using `np.linspace` to create equally spaced points.  A 7x7 grid provides 49 placements, and I'll add the center of the surface as the 50th.
           
           I've already computed the correct range for both x and y.
           
           The final output will be a list of 50 tuples: `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`, where `surf_idx` is always 0 (surface 0), `theta` is always 0 radians, and `x` and `y` are the calculated grid coordinates. These points will be used to ensure valid and robust object placements on surface 0.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object ID 6**
           
           Okay, so I've got the task: find 50 stable spots for object ID 6 on surface 0.  A key constraint?  No collisions with that pesky object ID 5 that's already in place.  I've got the scene's dimensions – a square surface from -0.135 to 0.135 in both X and Y.  Object 6 is roughly a 0.08 by 0.08 square, so I calculate its half-extents (about 0.04) and figure out the valid range for its center point, initially thinking only about the surface boundaries.
           
           Then comes the crucial part: avoiding Object 5.  Its center coordinates and bounding box are known.  To prevent a crash, the new object's bounding box can't overlap. I analyze the conditions for collision, which involve checking the X and Y coordinates of their centers relative to each other and their extents.  I quickly see that the simplest approach is to make sure Object 6 ends up either to the *right* of, or *above* Object 5.
           
           So, I define a safety margin, calculated using the dimensions of Object 5 and 6 (it's about -0.0006 for both x and y). Any center coordinate for object 6 that is to the right of this threshold (-0.0006) for x, or above this threshold for y, is going to be valid.
           
           To generate the candidate placements, I create a grid of points over the available space.  I'm starting with a 9x9 grid, which should give me around 80 points to work with. I calculate the bad or invalid region based on my collision rules. I can quickly filter out and identify which grid points are within the collision area. The points that are safe is if their x-coord is beyond the separation threshold, or their y-coord is greater than the same separation threshold.  After analyzing the grid's dimensions, I filter and conclude I will have 65 points. The goal is to generate 50 stable configurations, so after validating my calculations, I take the first 50 configurations, for placement and further analysis.

(Thoughts: **My Current Approach to Stable Placement of Object ID 4**
           
           I'm tackling the challenge of placing object ID 4 stably (i.e., without any rotation, for simplicity) on surface 0, while carefully avoiding collisions with existing objects, specifically IDs 5 and 6. I've already calculated the valid area for placement on surface 0, considering the object's square-like shape and size. Now, I'm identifying areas on the surface where I *can't* place ID 4 because they are occupied by ID 5 and ID 6.
           
           To do this, I've defined a grid of potential center points for ID 4 across the surface. Then, I wrote an efficient algorithm to check each potential placement's bounding box and identify which points on the grid have collision with the bounding boxes of ID 5 and ID 6. If ID 4's bounding box intersects with either ID 5 or ID 6, the placement is deemed invalid.
           
           In essence, I'm filtering out the collision zones and generating a list of center points for object ID 4 that are collision-free on the surface.

(Thoughts: **My objective is clear: to place 50 stable instances of object ID 7 onto surface 0 without any collisions.**  I've already laid the groundwork by defining the valid placement area on the surface, accounting for the object's size and shape (a square). I know the exact bounds where the center of object ID 7 *must* reside to fit.
           
           The challenge lies in avoiding collisions with three previously placed objects: ID 5, ID 6, and ID 4.  I have calculated precise bounding boxes (BBs) for each of these existing objects.  With these bounding boxes established, I now have the data to start the collision detection logic.
           
           My approach will be to generate a dense grid of candidate center points for object ID 7 and then filter them by checking for collisions against the existing object's bounding boxes.  I've set up a function to efficiently perform this collision check between the candidate object and the existing placed objects. I can reuse the function for all other future placed objects.
           
           The grid generation process involves calculating the appropriate grid spacing.  For this implementation, a 12x12 grid gives me more than enough candidate points. Now the python code runs with the logic I have set.
