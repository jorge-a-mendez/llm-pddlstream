           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains several objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) that are currently supported by v11, and the goal is to have all of them on v18. The object v18 is a stackable surface. We have two arms, v4 and v6, both are currently handempty.
           
           The provided action instances only include a `move_base` action that moves from configuration v3 to v3, using trajectory #o0. This action is trivial and doesn't change the robot's base configuration or interact with any objects.
           
           The goal requires placing four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) onto v18. To achieve this, we would need a sequence of `pick` and `place` actions for each object. However, no `pick` or `place` action instances are provided in the allowed actions list. The only available action is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, which does not help in manipulating objects. Therefore, with the given allowed actions, it is impossible to achieve the goal.
           
           The current state shows that objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` are all `on v11` (derived from `supported` and `atpose` axioms). The goal is to move them all to `on v18`. To achieve this, we would need `pick` actions to lift each object from `v11` and `place` actions to put them onto `v18`. Since there are no allowed `pick` or `place` actions, the goal is unreachable.
