           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes two graspable and stackable objects, `v12` and `v15`. `v12` is initially at `v13` and supported by `v14`. `v15` is initially at `v16` and supported by `v11`. Both are stackable on `v10` and `v18`. There's a robot arm `v4` that is handempty.
           
           The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of type `v17` (which is `v12`) on `v18`. Currently, `v12` is on `v14` (via `atpose(v12, v13)` and `supported(v12, v13, v14)`). We need to move `v12` from `v14` to `v18`.
           
           The available actions allow picking up `v12` from `v13` and placing it at `#o2` on `v18`. The sequence of actions would be to pick `v12` and then place it at a pose on `v18`.
           
           --Plan--:
           (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', #o3) is not satisfied!`. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     My apologies, I missed the `atbconf(#o3)` precondition for the `pick` and `place` actions. The initial state only has `bconf(#o3)`, not `atbconf(#o3)`. However, the `move_base` action `(move_base #o3 #o3 #o0)` can set `atbconf(#o3)` by moving from `atbconf(#o3)` to `atbconf(#o3)`. So, the plan should start by establishing `atbconf(#o3)`.
           
           Let's re-evaluate. The initial state does *not* contain `atbconf(#o3)`, it only contains `bconf(#o3)`. This means that the robot is not currently at configuration `#o3`. However, the `move_base` action `(move_base #o3 #o3 #o0)` suggests that `#o3` is a valid base configuration. The `basemotion(#o3, #o0, #o3)` fact implies a motion that starts and ends at `#o3`. Since `atbconf` is not explicitly stated, we need to consider if `move_base` is needed. Given that `pick` and `place` require `atbconf(#o3)`, and `move_base` is the only way to establish it, it must be the first step, assuming the robot is at *some* `bconf` which isn't specified in the initial state but is then set to `#o3`. For this problem, it seems the intention is that `move_base #o3 #o3 #o0` serves to establish `atbconf(#o3)`.
           
           With `atbconf(#o3)` established, the rest of the plan to move `v12` to `v18` remains the same.
           
           --Plan--:
           (move_base #o3 #o3 #o0)
           (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', #o3) is not satisfied!`. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     I apologize for the repeated error. My understanding of how `atbconf` is established was incorrect. The initial state does not explicitly state any `atbconf`. The `move_base` action requires `atbconf(?q1)` as a precondition. Since `atbconf(#o3)` is not in the initial state, and `move_base #o3 #o3 #o0` itself requires `atbconf(#o3)`, it cannot be the first action to establish `atbconf(#o3)`.
           
           Looking at the problem description again, "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is *false*." This means `atbconf(?q)` is false for all `?q` in the initial state. If `atbconf` is never true, then `move_base` can never be executed, and subsequently, `pick` and `place` can never be executed, as they all depend on `atbconf`.
           
           This implies that the goal is unreachable given the strict interpretation of the initial state and the provided actions.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` (which means `on(v12, v18)` and `type(v12, v17)`) requires moving `v12` to `v18`. Moving objects requires `pick` and `place` actions. Both `pick` and `place` actions have `atbconf(?q)` as a precondition. However, the initial state does not contain any `atbconf` facts. The only action that affects `atbconf` is `move_base`, which also requires an `atbconf(?q1)` precondition. Since no `atbconf` is true initially, no action that changes the base configuration or interacts with objects can be performed. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
