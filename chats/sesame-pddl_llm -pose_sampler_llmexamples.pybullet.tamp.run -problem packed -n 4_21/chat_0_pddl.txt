           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27. The object is also square, with side length approximately 0.084. I need to place the object on the surface such that it is fully contained. Since the object is square, its dimensions are the same for x and y. Rotating a square object by 90 degrees or 180 degrees will result in the same bounding box, so I can try different rotations. The center of the surface is (0,0). The center of the object can be anywhere within the surface, as long as its extents do not go beyond the surface boundaries.
           
           The surface ranges from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. The object has a size of 0.08422447975906633. If the object is not rotated, its half-extents are 0.042112239879533165.
           So, the center of the object (cx, cy) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.042112239879533165 <= cx <= 0.135 - 0.042112239879533165
           -0.09288776012046684 <= cx <= 0.09288776012046684
           
           And similarly for cy.
           
           I will generate placements that vary the position and rotation within these bounds.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27. I have successfully placed object 5 at the center of the surface without rotation.
           The new object, ID 6, is also square, with side length approximately 0.088. I need to place this object on the surface such that it is fully contained, and *without colliding with object 5*. Object 5 is located at (0,0) with no rotation. Its half-extents are 0.042112239879533165. So, object 5 occupies the region from roughly -0.042 to 0.042 in both x and y.
           
           The new object (ID 6) has size_x = 0.08847825130290848 and size_y = 0.08847825130290854. Its half-extents are approximately 0.0442.
           The surface ranges from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           For the new object, its center (cx, cy) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.0442 <= cx <= 0.135 - 0.0442
           -0.0908 <= cx <= 0.0908
           
           And similarly for cy.
           
           I need to avoid the region occupied by object 5, which is from roughly -0.042 to 0.042 in x and y.
           So, the center of object 6 must be such that its bounding box does not overlap with the bounding box of object 5.
           If object 6 is centered at (cx, cy) with no rotation, its x-range is [cx - 0.0442, cx + 0.0442] and y-range is [cy - 0.0442, cy + 0.0442].
           To avoid collision with object 5, which is at (0,0) with half-extents 0.0421, the center of object 6 must satisfy:
           abs(cx) > 0.0421 + 0.0442 = 0.0863, OR
           abs(cy) > 0.0421 + 0.0442 = 0.0863.
           
           Given the maximum allowed center is 0.0908, this means I can place it near the corners or edges, but not too close to the center. For example, if cx is 0.09, then the x-range is [0.09 - 0.0442, 0.09 + 0.0442] = [0.0458, 0.1342]. This doesn't overlap with object 5's x-range [-0.0421, 0.0421]. So, (0.09, 0.0) would be a valid placement. Similarly, (0.0, 0.09), (-0.09, 0.0), (0.0, -0.09), and all four corners like (0.09, 0.09) should be valid.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27.
           I have successfully placed:
           - Object 5: ID 5, size 0.0842, at (0,0) with 0 rotation. Its bounding box is approximately [-0.0421, 0.0421] in x and y.
           - Object 6: ID 6, size 0.0885, at (0.09, 0.0) with 0 rotation. Its bounding box is approximately [0.09 - 0.0442, 0.09 + 0.0442] = [0.0458, 0.1342] in x, and [-0.0442, 0.0442] in y.
           
           The new object, ID 4, is also square, with side length approximately 0.0946. Its half-extents are approximately 0.0473.
           The surface ranges from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           For the new object (ID 4), its center (cx, cy) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.0473 <= cx <= 0.135 - 0.0473
           -0.0877 <= cx <= 0.0877
           
           And similarly for cy.
           
           I need to avoid collisions with both object 5 and object 6.
           Object 5 (at (0,0), half-extents 0.0421):
           To avoid collision in x: abs(cx) > 0.0421 + 0.0473 = 0.0894.
           To avoid collision in y: abs(cy) > 0.0421 + 0.0473 = 0.0894.
           This means placing it exactly at the maximum allowed center (0.0877) might still cause a slight collision if one coordinate is near zero. So, to be safe, I should place it further. However, the maximum center is 0.0877, which is less than 0.0894. This means I cannot place object 4 directly adjacent to object 5 along a single axis if object 4 has 0 rotation. This could be due to the conservative bounding box collision check. Let's try to place it such that the center is outside the sum of half-extents.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the collision check more precisely for object 4 (half-extents 0.0473) and object 5 (half-extents 0.0421).
           If object 4 is at (cx, cy) and object 5 is at (0,0):
           Collision if:
           (abs(cx) < 0.0473 + 0.0421) AND (abs(cy) < 0.0473 + 0.0421)
           (abs(cx) < 0.0894) AND (abs(cy) < 0.0894)
           
           Now for object 6 (at (0.09, 0.0), half-extents 0.0442):
           If object 4 is at (cx, cy) and object 6 is at (0.09, 0.0):
           Collision if:
           (abs(cx - 0.09) < 0.0473 + 0.0442) AND (abs(cy - 0.0) < 0.0473 + 0.0442)
           (abs(cx - 0.09) < 0.0915) AND (abs(cy) < 0.0915)
           
           The allowed range for (cx, cy) is [-0.0877, 0.0877].
           This implies that I cannot place object 4 at (0,0) or too close to it.
           I also cannot place it too close to (0.09, 0.0). For example, (0.09, 0.0) for object 4 would result in:
           abs(0.09 - 0.09) = 0 < 0.0915. So it would collide with object 6.
           Also, (0.09, 0.0) is outside the allowed range for cx. The maximum cx is 0.0877.
           
           Considering the maximum allowed center for object 4 is 0.0877, and the minimum x-separation from object 5's center is 0.0894, object 4 cannot be placed directly to the left, right, top, or bottom of object 5, if it's not rotated. It must be placed diagonally.
           For example, if cx = 0.0877 and cy = 0.0877, this is a corner of the allowed placement region for object 4.
           Let's check collision with object 5 at (0,0).
           (abs(0.0877) < 0.0894) is TRUE.
           (abs(0.0877) < 0.0894) is TRUE.
           This implies (0.0877, 0.0877) would collide with object 5, which seems to imply that there might be no space for object 4 if the bounding box collision is strict.
           
           However, the problem statement says I should use previous placements that "did not collide with fixed obstacles" as positive examples. It might be that the collision check for fixed obstacles is less strict or different than for objects. Or, my understanding of how much space is needed for "collision" is overly conservative.
           
           Let's assume the success (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) for ID 5 means that its bounding box is [-0.0421, 0.0421] x [-0.0421, 0.0421].
           And (0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.0) for ID 6 means its bounding box is [0.0458, 0.1342] x [-0.0442, 0.0442].
           
           The current object 4 has half-extents 0.0473.
           Its center must be in [-0.0877, 0.0877].
           
           Let's try to place it at (-0.087, 0.087).
           Does it collide with object 5 at (0,0)?
           x-range of obj 4: [-0.087 - 0.0473, -0.087 + 0.0473] = [-0.1343, -0.0397]
           y-range of obj 4: [0.087 - 0.0473, 0.087 + 0.0473] = [0.0397, 0.1343]
           x-range of obj 5: [-0.0421, 0.0421]
           y-range of obj 5: [-0.0421, 0.0421]
           No collision in x: -0.0397 < -0.0421 is false, but -0.1343 to -0.0397 and -0.0421 to 0.0421 are disjoint.
           No collision in y: 0.0397 to 0.1343 and -0.0421 to 0.0421 are disjoint.
           So (-0.087, 0.087) does not collide with object 5.
           
           Does it collide with object 6 at (0.09, 0.0)?
           x-range of obj 4: [-0.1343, -0.0397]
           y-range of obj 4: [0.0397, 0.1343]
           x-range of obj 6: [0.0458, 0.1342]
           y-range of obj 6: [-0.0442, 0.0442]
           No collision in x: [-0.1343, -0.0397] and [0.0458, 0.1342] are disjoint.
           No collision in y: [0.0397, 0.1343] and [-0.0442, 0.0442] are disjoint.
           So (-0.087, 0.087) does not collide with object 6.
           
           This corner placement should be valid. Let's try other corners.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27.
           I have successfully placed:
           - Object 5: ID 5, size 0.0842, at (0,0) with 0 rotation. Bounding box (BB): approximately [-0.0421, 0.0421] in x and y.
           - Object 6: ID 6, size 0.0885, at (0.09, 0.0) with 0 rotation. BB: approximately [0.0458, 0.1342] in x, and [-0.0442, 0.0442] in y.
           - Object 4: ID 4, size 0.0946, at (-0.087, 0.087) with 0 rotation. BB: approximately [-0.1343, -0.0397] in x, and [0.0397, 0.1343] in y.
           
           The new object, ID 7, is also square, with side length approximately 0.0761. Its half-extents are approximately 0.0381.
           The surface ranges from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           For object 7, its center (cx, cy) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.0381 <= cx <= 0.135 - 0.0381
           -0.0969 <= cx <= 0.0969
           And similarly for cy.
           
           I need to avoid collisions with objects 5, 6, and 4.
           
           Let's check potential clear areas.
           Object 5 is in the center. Object 6 is to the right. Object 4 is in the top-left.
           This leaves the bottom-left, top-right, and bottom-right corners, and possibly some gaps along the edges.
           
           Let's try to place object 7 in the bottom-left corner. A center like (-0.09, -0.09).
           x-range of obj 7: [-0.09 - 0.0381, -0.09 + 0.0381] = [-0.1281, -0.0519]
           y-range of obj 7: [-0.09 - 0.0381, -0.09 + 0.0381] = [-0.1281, -0.0519]
           
           Collision check with object 5 (BB: [-0.0421, 0.0421] x [-0.0421, 0.0421]):
           Object 7 x-range [-0.1281, -0.0519] does not overlap with Object 5 x-range [-0.0421, 0.0421]. (max of 7 < min of 5)
           Object 7 y-range [-0.1281, -0.0519] does not overlap with Object 5 y-range [-0.0421, 0.0421]. (max of 7 < min of 5)
           No collision with object 5.
           
           Collision check with object 6 (BB: [0.0458, 0.1342] x [-0.0442, 0.0442]):
           Object 7 x-range [-0.1281, -0.0519] does not overlap with Object 6 x-range [0.0458, 0.1342]. (max of 7 < min of 6)
           Object 7 y-range [-0.1281, -0.0519] does not overlap with Object 6 y-range [-0.0442, 0.0442]. (max of 7 < min of 6)
           No collision with object 6.
           
           Collision check with object 4 (BB: [-0.1343, -0.0397] x [0.0397, 0.1343]):
           Object 7 x-range [-0.1281, -0.0519] overlaps with Object 4 x-range [-0.1343, -0.0397]. (Overlap: [-0.1281, -0.0519])
           Object 7 y-range [-0.1281, -0.0519] does not overlap with Object 4 y-range [0.0397, 0.1343]. (max of 7 < min of 4)
           Since the y-ranges do not overlap, there is no collision with object 4.
           
           So, a placement like (-0.09, -0.09) should be valid. Let's explore other similar valid positions.
           The corner at (0.09, -0.09) should also be free.
           And possibly along edges, like (0.09, -0.0). Oh wait, 0.0 is occupied by obj 5 and 6.
           
           Let's try (0.09, -0.09) for obj 7.
           x-range: [0.09 - 0.0381, 0.09 + 0.0381] = [0.0519, 0.1281]
           y-range: [-0.09 - 0.0381, -0.09 + 0.0381] = [-0.1281, -0.0519]
           
           Vs obj 5 (center (0,0)):
           x-ranges [0.0519, 0.1281] and [-0.0421, 0.0421] are disjoint.
           y-ranges [-0.1281, -0.0519] and [-0.0421, 0.0421] are disjoint.
           No collision with obj 5.
           
           Vs obj 6 (center (0.09, 0.0)):
           x-ranges [0.0519, 0.1281] and [0.0458, 0.1342] overlap. (Overlap: [0.0519, 0.1281])
           y-ranges [-0.1281, -0.0519] and [-0.0442, 0.0442] are disjoint.
           No collision with obj 6.
           
           Vs obj 4 (center (-0.087, 0.087)):
           x-ranges [0.0519, 0.1281] and [-0.1343, -0.0397] are disjoint.
           y-ranges [-0.1281, -0.0519] and [0.0397, 0.1343] are disjoint.
           No collision with obj 4.
           
           So (0.09, -0.09) is also a valid placement.
