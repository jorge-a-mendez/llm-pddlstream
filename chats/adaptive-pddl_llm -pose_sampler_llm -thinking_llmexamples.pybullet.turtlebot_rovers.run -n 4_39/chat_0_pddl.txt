User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Strategy for Robot Base Placement**
           
           My task is to determine three viable base positions for a robot, adhering to specific constraints: each base must be within a 2-unit radius of a designated target point, and the robot's orientation will automatically adjust to face the target.  The environment contains fixed obstacles represented as Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs).  Crucially, the robot's position is also limited to a region defined by  `x: [-2.5, 2.5]` and `y: [-2.5, 2.5]`.
           
           My approach is systematic: First, I meticulously analyze the provided AABBs to construct a mental model of the scene. The primary challenge stems from a central vertical wall located at x=0, which significantly impacts potential base locations. Given that the target point is positioned just left of this wall, any potential robot base must also be situated on the left side to maintain line-of-sight. Any base on the opposite side of the target would be instantly occluded.
           
           Next, I generate candidate positions at a 2-unit distance from the target point. To ensure diversity and line-of-sight, these positions are generated in various directions: left, up, and northwest (which I'll refine later based on the results). For each candidate, I apply these checks:
           1.  Verify that its coordinates fall within the environment bounds (`x: [-2.5, 2.5]`, `y: [-2.5, 2.5]`).
           2.  Guarantee the x-coordinate is less than -0.05, ensuring it stays on the correct side of the central wall.
           3.  Check for collisions with all relevant fixed obstacles. A collision occurs if the candidate point is enclosed within any obstacle's AABB.
           
           This process eliminates candidates that violate the constraints. For example, a South-West position collided with an obstacle and was discarded. The remaining candidates are deemed valid. Finally, I confirm that each point also satisfies the maximum allowed distance of 2 from the target.
           
           By systematically considering both line-of-sight (relative to the central wall) and obstacle avoidance, I am able to identify 3 valid and well-distributed positions.
