(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements for a Square Object on a Surface**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to figure this out. I need to place a square object (0.07 x 0.07) on surface 0, which is a rectangular area bounded by ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  Essentially, I'm working with a 0.6 x 0.6 area. The goal is 50 placements, and they need to be "stable," meaning the entire object's bounding box must fit within the surface's boundaries.
           
           First, I need to understand how rotation affects things. For the square, rotation makes the bounding box a square too, but larger. The amount it grows depends on the rotation angle (theta). I figured out the rotated side length `dim_rot` of the object's bounding box will be `0.07 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This value ranges from 0.07 (no rotation or 90 degrees) to approximately 0.099 (45-degree rotation).
           
           Now, to make sure the object is stable, the object's bounding box, after any rotation, needs to fit within that 0.6 x 0.6 area of the surface. So, for a given theta, the (x, y) coordinates of the object's center must be within a certain range. The valid range for x and y depends on that rotated side length I mentioned earlier.
           
           I'm aiming for variety in the placements, so I'll try several rotations. Because a square has rotational symmetry every pi/2 radians, and the calculation for `dim_rot` is symmetric over pi/2, angles from 0 to pi are sufficient to cover all unique orientations for my purposes.
           
           My strategy is to generate `num_angles` * `num_xy_per_angle` total placements. To cover enough orientations I picked `num_angles` as 10 evenly spaced angles between 0 and pi (0, pi/10, 2pi/10, ...9pi/10). And for each of those 10 angles, I'll generate 5 different (x, y) coordinates for placement. I will vary the (x, y) positions for each of these angles. Each set of (x, y) points includes the corners of the valid rectangle and the center.
           This method ensures that I generate 50 distinct placements and that I cover an appropriate space.
           I believe this approach will give a diverse and stable set of placements.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing and Refining Object Placement for ID 5 & 10:**
           
           Okay, so the feedback was pretty clear: my initial calculations for placing object ID 5 were slightly off, specifically regarding how much space a rotated square needs within the surface boundaries. It looks like I was using an incorrect `dim_rot` in my calculation of valid x and y center ranges, which led to some objects extending beyond the surface's AABB. I dug back into the math, re-evaluating how to accurately determine the dimensions of a rotated square's bounding box and correctly establish the containment conditions.
           
           I meticulously went through one of the failed examples, carefully calculating the rotated dimensions and the valid center point ranges. I pinpointed my error in how I handled the rotation, particularly with the `dim_rot` and its halved version. The problem was that the object's corners were hanging over the edge due to a small miscalculation.
           
           After that deep dive, I'm confident I've got a handle on the geometry now. I even got the error message's AABB and Surface AABB and checked that my calculations matched them - the math lined up perfectly now.  I've adjusted my approach to precisely calculate `half_effective_dim`, ensuring that the object's bounding box stays firmly within the surface's boundaries for both ID 5 and now, ID 10.
           
           Now, for object ID 10 (a slightly larger square), I'm leveraging the same strategy, but with absolute precision in my calculations. The goal is to generate 50 placements, each guaranteed to be stable and contained within the surface. I will choose 10 different angles for the rotation and I will use the corners, center, and edges inside the bounding box, making sure the math is right and that the bounding box fits.
