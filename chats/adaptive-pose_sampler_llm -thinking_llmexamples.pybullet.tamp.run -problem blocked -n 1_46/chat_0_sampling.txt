(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 5 (0.07 x 0.07 Square) on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to generate 50 stable placements for the given square object (ID 5, dimensions 0.07 x 0.07) on a single surface (Surface 0) defined by the bounds ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)). A stable placement is defined by the surface index, orientation (theta), and center coordinates (x, y) of the object.  The object must be fully contained within the surface boundaries.
           
           First, I need to calculate the effective half-width (h_eff) of the rotated square, as this determines the safe boundaries for placement. Since the object is a square, the effective half-width is consistently  `0.5 * 0.07 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This value varies between 0.035 and approximately 0.0495 depending on the rotation.
           
           Next, I determined the surface dimensions and valid range for x and y center coordinate placement.  Using this h_eff, I calculate the `x_min`, `x_max`, `y_min`, and `y_max` coordinates that will keep the object inside surface 0.
           
           To ensure diversity in orientations and positions, I decided on a methodical approach. First, I selected 10 distinct angles between 0 and pi. I used  `k * math.pi / 10` for `k = 0 to 9`. For each of these ten angles, I calculated the effective half-width, and the valid region for the center points of the object.  Then, within the defined regions, I choose 5 center coordinate (x,y) positions using a defined fractional distribution of the available ranges, for the 50 placements.  The positions (x,y) are generated in these 5 configurations:  `x_fracs = [0.2, 0.8, 0.5, 0.2, 0.8]` and `y_fracs = [0.2, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 0.8]` relative to the surface's valid x,y ranges. These fractional coordinates ensure a good distribution of the objects on the given surface.  I then store these as tuples `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`. The object is a square and therefore rotation by  `pi/2` yields overlapping placements. This gives 10 valid thetas, times 5 valid placements per theta.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Strategy for Placement of a New Object**
           
           I've been tasked with finding 50 stable, collision-free placements for a new square object (ID 10) on Surface 0, which already has a smaller square object (ID 5) placed successfully.  My primary concern is avoiding overlap between these two objects.  The surface is small (0.6x0.6), so I need to be precise.
           
           First, I analyzed the existing placement of Object ID 5, noting its dimensions (0.07x0.07) and position (4.341, -0.459).  Since it's at a 0-degree angle, its bounding box is axis-aligned.  This information forms the "exclusion zone" I need to work around.
           
           Then I moved to object ID 10 with its dimensions slightly different than object ID 5. (0.07131095081673955 x 0.07131095081673955).
           Knowing the surface's boundaries and object 5, I calculated the effective half-width (`h_eff`) of Object 10 based on its rotation angle (`theta`).  The critical factor is the rotated bounding box. Maximum `h_eff` happens at 45 degrees, where the rotated AABB is 1.414 * s, or approximately 0.0504; and the minimum for an object aligned to the axis at angles that are multiples of pi/2 happens where the value is simply half the size, so approximately 0.035.
           
           I devised a strategy that generates candidate placement locations and then carefully filters for collisions. I do this by calculating the ranges in x and y that object 10 can fit based on the rotation angle, checking the AABB for those placements, and only adding them to my list if they do not intersect with object 5's AABB.  By using the `check_collision_aabb` helper function, I will ensure proper handling of all the conditions necessary to avoid collision.
           
           My methodology involves:
           
           1.  Determining valid ranges for x and y center positions of Object 10 based on its size and theta.
           2.  Checking candidate points within surface bounds with the correct bounding box.
           3.  Avoiding the bounding box around object ID 5.
           
           I will iterate through 10 possible angles, sampling positions and filtering for collisions until I reach 50 unique, stable placements, or until all possible placements are exhausted.  By using the script I've prepared, I will obtain the 50 desired placements.
