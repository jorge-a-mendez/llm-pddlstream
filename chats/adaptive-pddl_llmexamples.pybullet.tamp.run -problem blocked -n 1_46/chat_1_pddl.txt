           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains several objects: `#o0`, `#o1`, `#o2`, `#o3`, `#o4` (continuous parameters), and `v3` through `v18` (discrete objects).
           The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both of which are initially empty. The robot is at base configuration `v3` and arm configurations `v5` (for `v4`) and `v7` (for `v6`). The robot `canmove()`.
           Objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v15` are graspable.
           `v8` is currently at `v9` supported by `v11`. It is stackable on `v10` and `v18`. Its type is `v17`.
           `v12` is currently at `v13` supported by `v14`. It is stackable on `v10` and `v18`. Its type is `v17`.
           `v15` is currently at `v16` supported by `v11`. It is stackable on `v10`.
           There are various kinematic configurations (`kin`) for arm `v4` to interact with `v8`, `v12`, and `v15` at different poses and grasps (`#o1`, `#o2`) and base configurations (`#o3`), involving arm trajectory `#o4`.
           The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. Looking at the initial state, `v8` and `v12` have type `v17` and are stackable on `v18`. This means either `v8` or `v12` needs to be placed on `v18`. Since `v12` is of type `v17`, we can choose `v12` to be our `?green` object.
           The plan would then involve picking up `v12` from its current pose `v13` and placing it on `v18`.
           
           However, the only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action only moves the base from `v3` to `v3` (effectively not moving) and consumes the `canmove()` predicate without re-establishing it (unless there is an implicit re-establishment that is not shown in the action definition, which there isn't). This action alone cannot achieve the goal of moving an object, as it does not involve any picking or placing. Furthermore, `new-axiom@0()` implies `on(?o, v18)`, which means placing an object on `v18`. The `move_base` action cannot achieve this.
           Since no `pick` or `place` actions are provided as valid action instances, the goal is unachievable with the given constraints.
