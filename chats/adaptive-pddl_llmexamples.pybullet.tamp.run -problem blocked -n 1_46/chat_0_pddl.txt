           #o1: object

           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom type(v8, v17)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom type(v12, v17)
           Atom stackable(v12, v18)
           Atom pose(v15, v16)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v14)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom stackable(v15, v10)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom graspable(v15)
           Atom stackable(v8, v18)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable and stackable objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v15`. `v8` is currently at `v9` and is supported by `v11`. `v12` is at `v13` and supported by `v14`. `v15` is at `v16` and supported by `v11`. There are two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both are handempty. The robot is at base configuration `v3` and arm configurations `v5` (for `v4`) and `v7` (for `v6`). The `canmove()` predicate is true. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which, according to the axioms, is true if `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true. We are given `type(v12, v17)`. Therefore, we need to make `on(v12, v18)` true. This means `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)` for some pose `?p`. The initial state already contains `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. So the task is to move `v12` to `#o2`.
           
           However, the only available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not change the state of objects on surfaces. There are no `pick` or `place` actions available, nor `clean` or `cook` actions. Without `pick` and `place` actions, the robot cannot manipulate `v12` to be at pose `#o2` and thus achieve the `on(v12, v18)` condition for `new-axiom@0()`.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the given set of allowed actions.
