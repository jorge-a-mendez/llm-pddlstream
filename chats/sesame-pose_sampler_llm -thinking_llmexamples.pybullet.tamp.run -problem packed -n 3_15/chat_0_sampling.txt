           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **My plan is to generate 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5) on surface 0.** Given the surface's bounding box and the object's size, I've calculated the valid range for the object's center coordinates (x and y) to ensure it stays fully contained. Since the object is a square, its bounding box remains the same regardless of its orientation. Therefore, I can primarily use a rotation of zero (0.0) for the placements, but I will introduce a single different rotation to fulfill the request.
           
           I'll create a grid of 49 points within the calculated valid range using a 7x7 grid. The grid step will ensure the maximum spread within the valid ranges. Finally, I'll add one more placement at the center of the surface with a rotation of pi/4 (45 degrees) for diversity. This ensures I get 50 unique placements as the requirement. All the placements will be on surface 0, and no consideration is needed for object collision, as requested. The output will be a list of tuples, each representing a placement as (surface index, rotation angle, x-coordinate, y-coordinate).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement for Object ID 4**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. We've got a new request to place object ID 4, a square with dimensions 0.08567... x 0.08567..., on surface 0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).  The key challenge is avoiding a collision with the pre-existing object ID 5, already positioned on the surface. Object 5 occupies an AABB starting at (-0.135, -0.135) and ending at (-0.036, -0.036). We need to identify 50 stable placements.
           
           My approach is to create a strategic grid and rotate a few placements to diversify.
           
           For simplicity, let's start with placements at `theta=0`.  The center of object 4 can only lie within [-0.092, 0.092] on both the x and y axes to fit inside the surface. However, it cannot overlap object 5, which occupies most of the bottom-left corner of the surface.  Since object 5's AABB is in the lower left, I must keep object 4's center above, to the right, or a combination of the two.
           
           I've generated a 7x7 grid for valid placements. I made sure to exclude those points inside the region that would lead to a collision with object 5, defined as a rectangle in the lower left corner.
           
           The result is 33 placements with `theta=0`. These points are all above and to the right of object 5, in the AABB of surface 0.
           
           To get the remaining placements to reach 50, I'll take a subset of the 33 valid placements and rotate the object to `theta=pi/2`, since object 4 is a square. So, 12 of these placements, I will create placements with `theta=pi/2`.
           
           For more diversity, I'll also add a few placements using `theta=pi/4`. The rotation reduces valid center placement range to [-0.074, 0.074] for x and y.  Object 5 is still an obstacle. Thus, to avoid any collision, the valid regions are those centers lying above and to the right of the existing object.
           This gives me 5 more points.
           
           In sum, I have 33 points with `theta=0`, 12 points with `theta=pi/2`, and 5 points with `theta=pi/4`. These 50 unique placements are valid and collision-free.

(Thoughts: **My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 6) on surface 0, while ensuring it doesn't collide with two existing objects (ID 5 and ID 4).**  Surface 0 is a rectangular area defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           Object ID 5 is positioned at `(0, 0, -0.08564832, -0.08564832)` with extents of `0.098703355` in both dimensions. Its AABB is `((-0.135, -0.135), (-0.036, -0.036))`.

           The new object has dimensions of `0.09766825177630195` x `0.09766825177630192`. Due to its near-square shape, I'll use `half_obj6_x = half_obj6_y = 0.048834125888150975`. For rotated positions (at a 45-degree angle), I calculate an effective half-diagonal, `half_obj6_rot`, which comes out to `0.0690626078278788`.
           
           To find valid placements, I first establish the allowed center ranges for the new object's AABB:  `-0.086` to `0.086` in both x and y. Then I calculate the collision zones: Object 5's collision zone is above `y = 0.0125` and/or right of `x = 0.0125`; object 4's collision zone is below `y = -0.0005` and/or left of `x = -0.060`. I now generate candidate center points, then filter out those that would collide with these areas.
           
           Using a fine grid within the bounds of surface 0, I scan the surface, filtering the collision spaces to find the safe 50.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single surface, `0`, defined by the axis-aligned bounding box `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           There are two previously placed objects that must be avoided:

           The new object (ID: 6) has extents `(0.09766825177630195, 0.09766825177630192)`.
           Let `obj6_hx = 0.09766825177630195 / 2 = 0.048834125888150975` and `obj6_hy = 0.09766825177630192 / 2 = 0.04883412588815096`.
           
           Crucially, when a request is made for an object `ID i`, and there are previous successful placements for `ID i`, those previous placements are *not* treated as obstacles for the current `ID i` object. The collision rule "avoid collision between objects i and j" applies only when `i != j`. Therefore, the previous successful placements of `ID 6` are NOT obstacles for the *new* placements of `ID 6`. I only need to avoid `ID 4` and `ID 5` placements.
           
           To ensure stability, the new object's AABB (considering its rotation) must be fully contained within surface `0` and must not collide with any of the AABBs of `ID 4` or `ID 5`.
           
           I will generate placements using a grid search across the surface, trying different common rotations (0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2, pi/4, 3pi/4 radians) to maximize diversity and coverage of stable spots. For each potential placement, I'll check for collisions with the 7 fixed obstacle AABBs (1 for ID 5, 6 for ID 4).
