(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for Object ID 6 on a Surface**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 6, which has dimensions of (0.09822311482414835, 0.09822311482414836), on the given surface: AABB `0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  This surface is a square with side length 0.27, centered at (0,0).  Since the object is almost a perfect square, I can leverage this symmetry to simplify the calculations.
           
           To ensure stability, I need to constrain the object's center coordinates (x, y) based on its effective size, which changes with rotation (theta).  The effective extents are calculated as:
           
           `effective_size_x = abs(size_x * cos(theta)) + abs(size_y * sin(theta))`
           `effective_size_y = abs(size_x * sin(theta)) + abs(size_y * cos(theta))`
           
           From these I can find valid (x,y) by the following formula.
           
           `surf_lower_x + effective_size_x / 2 <= x <= surf_upper_x - effective_size_x / 2`
           `surf_lower_y + effective_size_y / 2 <= y <= surf_upper_y - effective_size_y / 2`
           
           I started by approximating the object size as 0.098223.  With theta = 0, this simplifies to determining the maximum and minimum locations for (x, y).
           
           `x_min_bound = -0.135 + (0.098223/2) = -0.085888`
           `x_max_bound =  0.135 - (0.098223/2) = 0.085888`
           Similar calculations for y gave these values for the max and mins.
           
           I then chose to create a grid of 49 placements, all with a rotation of 0.  I created 7 evenly spaced x-coordinates between -0.085888 and 0.085888, and 7 similarly spaced y-coordinates.  These values are:
           
           *   `-0.085888, -0.057259, -0.028629, 0.0, 0.028629, 0.057259, 0.085888`
           
           The 50th placement is placed at `(0, np.pi/4, 0.0, 0.0)` for diversity.  The center of the object will then be within the bounds of  `[-0.06554269802168148, 0.06554269802168148]` for both x and y.  
           
           This approach efficiently covers a wide range of stable placements, exploiting the near-square shape of the object. Since there are no prior objects, there's no need to consider collision avoidance.  I know that these 50 placements are all stable placements, given the object and the surface provided.

Model:     **Finding 50 Stable Placements for Object ID 6 on a Surface**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 6, which has dimensions of (0.09822311482414835, 0.09822311482414836), on the given surface: AABB `0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.

           From these I can find valid (x,y) by the following formula.

           The 50th placement is placed at `(0, np.pi/4, 0.0, 0.0)` for diversity.  The center of the object will then be within the bounds of  `[-0.06554269802168148, 0.06554269802168148]` for both x and y.

(Thoughts: **My Approach to Placing Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with placing object ID 5 onto surface 0, avoiding collision with the already placed object ID 6. Object 6 is snug in the bottom-left corner and I need to strategically place this new, nearly square object without overlap. Here's my thought process:
           
           1.  **Calculate the Collision Zone:** I started by determining the exact bounds of object 6's occupied space. Knowing its size and position, I computed its minimum and maximum x and y coordinates. This essentially gave me the "forbidden zone" that object 5 *must* avoid.
           
           2.  **Determine Placement Limits:** Next, I considered the overall dimensions of surface 0. Using object 5's dimensions, I calculated the permissible center points for object 5, both in the x and y directions, assuming it's positioned at a zero degree rotation, ensuring its AABB would fit in the surface. This gave me the total space where the object can be validly placed.
           
           3.  **Collision Avoidance Criteria:** With both the "forbidden" region and available space defined, I formulated my collision avoidance criteria. Given a zero rotation object, a placement is valid if the object is *entirely* to the right of object 6, *or* if it's *entirely* above object 6. This is to guarantee the bounding boxes don't overlap.
           
           4.  **Density, Grid Approach, and Theta Variation:** I recognized that generating 50 diverse placements would be best achieved by leveraging a grid. This gives me a nice distribution that can take advantage of the surface as a whole.
               *   To do this for zero rotation, I established a grid, taking the area from the boundaries from step 2, removing the collision areas of 3, leaving a nice surface to place the objects in.
               *   To mix things up, I also wanted to introduce rotations, specifically pi/4 radians. The bounding box has a different shape and area now, which changes the available space, so I did a similar operation as above.
           
           5.  **Placement Validation:** I'm going to carefully apply my collision check to the calculated points. I need to generate enough *valid* positions for object 5.
               *   I'll generate the valid points.
               *   I'll filter out locations that overlap, and generate valid placements by combining rotations with grid locations.
           
           6.  **Finalize 50 Points:** I've ensured a diverse set of placements. I need to make sure I achieve the final 50. I have the main body of points, with the theta 0 and theta pi/4 points. But I need one more. So, I will also incorporate an edge placement as my 50th item.
               *   I'm confident in my strategy to produce 50 collision-free, valid placements for object ID 5.

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's break this down systematically to find those 50 stable placements for Object ID 4 on Surface 0, making sure to dodge collisions with Objects ID 5 and 6.**
           
           First, the key is understanding the surface and the other objects. Surface 0 is a nice, square-ish area: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  I've got two obstacles already:
           
           *   **Object ID 6:**  Its center is near (-0.086, -0.086), and it's a bit smaller than the surface, occupying the lower-left corner, and is almost square as well.
           *   **Object ID 5:** Its center is near (-0.088, 0.029), and it's the right middle section.
           
           My new object is a square of the size of the pre-existing objects, as well. 
           
           The strategy is simple: generate placement positions, check for collisions, and keep only the non-colliding ones. Since the object is square, there are two primary orientations to test:  `theta = 0` (aligned with the axes) and `theta = pi/4` (rotated 45 degrees).
           
           The first step is to calculate the effective half-extents (basically, half the size) of Object 4 in each orientation.  For `theta = 0`, it's just half the side length. For `theta = pi/4`, it's a bit bigger due to the rotation, since the AABB now needs to encompass the rotated square's corners.
           
           **Avoiding Collisions (theta = 0):**
           
           With `theta = 0`, I need to determine the collision-free regions.  I've already calculated the available surface area for Object 4 using surface dimensions. I determined that all the first column points are colliding with other objects. In order to be free of collision with obj 5 and obj 6 it has to lie at the coordinates where `x >= 0.01122` which is the case in `Region A` where there is a large rectangle with plenty of free space. A very small rectangle with some free space is the `Region B`. I determined the available (x,y) coordinates within both the rectangles which would give non colliding positions.
           
           **Collision Avoidance (theta = pi/4):**
           
           Again, I determined all the available space with a similar method as above. The coordinates that are collision free with `theta = pi/4` lies in the `Region A'` where there is a very small area and the `Region B'` which is a small area.
           
           I am generating the placements by going through all x and y coordinates that I found out for both theta=0 and theta=pi/4 to have the object in the desired placements. These are then compiled and will be rendered.
