           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find three distinct locations (x, y coordinates) for a robot base around a target point, ensuring each spot is within a range of 2 units, with the robot facing the target. The main challenges are avoiding collisions with those AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) obstacles and maintaining a clear line of sight to the target. Crucially, the robot needs to stay within the boundaries of x: [-2.5, 2.5] and y: [-2.5, 2.5].
           
           **Data Inspection and Spatial Reasoning**
           
           The provided obstacle list is the starting point. I can quickly spot some key patterns here: the outer square defining the environment and the obstacles composing the walls. Of particular interest is that vertical obstacle cutting down the center at x=0. That's going to be a real consideration, since my target (0.9, -1.0) and my goal are to pick a point that is visible to it.
           
           **Core Algorithm Design - Point and Line-of-Sight Checks**
           
           First, it's essential to check if a proposed base point is *inside* an obstacle or too far from the target. The core of the problem comes down to the line-of-sight test: I need to ensure a straight line between a proposed base point and the target doesn't intersect any obstacles.
           
           My approach will be straightforward: 1) Point in AABB check for valid base points. 2) Line-of-sight check by intersecting the line segment from base to target with each AABB obstacle. I'll rely on the Liang-Barsky line segment clipping algorithm, that should be more robust in determining if any part of the segment passes through an obstacle.
           
           **Specific Implementation Details and Edge Case Considerations**
           
           I will be using Python and define functions for `is_point_in_aabb` and `line_segment_collides_with_aabb`. I'll pay very close attention to edge cases like points *on* the boundaries of obstacles. Remember the x=0 vertical obstacle is key. The line of sight is blocked by the obstacle if the robot base is on the opposite side of the target.
           Since the task is to ensure visibility of the target, I must ensure that these constraints are observed. For line of sight to work, both endpoints of the segment must not be inside any obstacle and the segment itself must not intersect any obstacles.
           
           **Proposed Solution**
           
           The objective is to find a set of 3 diverse base positions. I will examine points around the target and check their validity and line of sight. It makes sense to test points above, below, to the left, and to the right of the target.
           
           **Candidate Positions and Validations**
           
           *   **Candidate 1:** Directly to the right of the target (2.4, -1.0), distance 1.5 units - This seems to work. The segment is a horizontal line from (2.4, -1.0) to (0.9, -1.0), and it avoids all obstacles.
           
           *   **Candidate 2:** Directly above the target (0.9, 0.5), distance 1.5 - With a vertical line of sight from (0.9, 0.5) to (0.9, -1.0), and it avoids all obstacles.
           
           *   **Candidate 3:** Bottom-right Diagonal: (1.96, -2.06) - Valid distance and appears to have clear line of sight.
           
           **Final Confirmation**
           The 3 valid positions are (2.4, -1.0), (0.9, 0.5) and (1.96, -2.06).

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Definition**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. First, I need to remember that the previous feedback I received was for a *different* target point, and therefore doesn't apply directly here. The *current* target is `(0.514, 1.833)`, which I'll call `T`. I need to generate three new positions for *this* target, based on the `x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5]` room limits, keeping in mind the distance constraint (max range 2) from `T` and the obstacle wall at x=0.
           
           **Analyzing Previous Feedback**
           
           I reviewed the previous failures, noting that they were primarily invalidated due to the distance constraint.  `x=2.4` failed because it hit the right wall, but, the coordinates suggested were already invalid because of being too far away. The other two positions proposed for the *previous* target point also did not satisfy the target constraints and distance constraints and therefore were also invalid.
           
           **Obstacle Awareness and Search Space Refinement**
           
           Now, for this target point `(0.514, 1.833)`. From the room limits and the target itself, I've determined that the valid area for the robot base is roughly `x in [0.05, 2.5]` and `y in [-0.167, 2.5]`.  I then identified and mapped the obstacles in this area.  Critical insight: the target point itself is *inside* two obstacles, a larger one (Obstacle 9) and a smaller one within it (Obstacle 20).
           
           **Line-of-Sight Problem and Strategic Maneuvering**
           
           This creates a significant challenge! If the target is embedded within an obstacle, it is impossible to have a clear line of sight to it. This suggests one of several possibilities: (a) My interpretation of "line-of-sight" is inaccurate for this simulation; (b) the simulator allows for visibility even of obstacles, in which case the target could be viewed; or (c) the target *object* should be seen. So, I will choose locations outside obstacles 9 and 20.
           
           **Generating Potential Positions**
           
           I will now find three potential positions, outside these obstacles, but still within range 2 of `T`.
           
           **Candidate 1:** I'll look for a position to the *left* of Obstacle 9 at `x = 0.1` and `y = 1.0` (outside of obstacles and is close to the target).
           **Candidate 2:** I'll select a position to the *right* of Obstacle 9 at `x = 0.8` and `y = 1.0` (it also must be outside the target, which it is because `x > 0.75`).
           **Candidate 3:** I'll set a position *below* Obstacle 9 at `x = 1.5` and `y = 0.5` (outside of these two target-centered obstacles and closer to the original target point).
           
           These three positions should be good candidates within the parameters provided, but this is assuming the target object must be viewable.
