(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable positions for a square object (size `0.0716` x `0.0716`) on a square surface (`-0.135` to `0.135` in x and y). Stability here means the object's AABB is entirely within the surface's boundaries. Since the object's square shape means its AABB always remain square and the problem states the `size_x` and `size_y` as *local* dimensions,  I'll explore a few rotation angles (`theta`) and then distribute object centers accordingly within the bounds.
           
           First, I define the key parameters: `S = 0.0716`, surface boundaries are -0.135 to 0.135, so I can use surface bounds to find the maximum possible center position `xb` that maintains object containment within the surface. The effective size of the object, `S_eff`, which is the side length of the bounding box around a rotated square, changes depending on the rotation.
           
           I'll consider a range of rotations from 0 to pi/2, namely 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8 and pi/2 to ensure spatial diversity.
           
           For a given `theta`, the rotated square's AABB size changes.
           For `theta = 0` or pi/2, there's no rotation and `S_eff = S`.
           For `theta = pi/4`, the biggest possible enclosing square is generated and the size is `S * sqrt(2)`. The sizes in-between are generated at `pi/8` and `3pi/8` that will represent AABB sizes between the min and max cases.
           
           For each of these angles, I'll calculate `S_eff` and derive the allowed range for the center (x, y) coordinates of the object. For each rotation, I'll place the object at various positions within the limits: center of surface, corners of the allowed region, midpoints of the sides of the allowable region.
           
           So, in the end, for each rotation angle, I calculate `xb` such that the object can be centered on a point and still be contained by the surface. And within that `xb`, I place 10 locations. The plan is to get a uniform distribution with varying rotations.

(Thoughts: **My plan for object placement, a detailed breakdown:**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed object 4, a small square, at the origin. Now, I need to figure out where to place object 5, which is a slightly larger square, without any overlap. This is surface 0, and the overall boundaries are clearly defined.
           
           Here's my approach: First, I'll calculate the effective bounding box size of object 5, depending on how it's rotated. Since both are squares, this rotation impacts the overall size. Then I'll determine the potential "safe" region on the surface, keeping in mind only the surface boundaries.
           
           I'll iterate through possible placement locations, checking each one against object 4 for any collisions. To do this, I need to know the AABB of both objects for that specific orientation. Object 4’s AABB is easy, it's already at (0,0) and the dimensions are well-known. For object 5, the AABB changes with its orientation and position. I’ll make a function for it and store it.
           
           Let's do some calculations to see what my limits will be.
           For `theta = 0`, the effective size of object 5 is the same as its side length: about 0.084. If no collision, then its x and y bounds must be between `-0.09299` and `0.09299`.
           For `theta = pi/4`, that will mean 0.118 and the range for the bounding center will be -0.07559 and 0.07559.
           
           Now the important part. To avoid collision, I need to keep the AABBs of the two squares from overlapping. I’ll ensure that either object 5’s x-interval is entirely to the left or right of object 4’s, or the same for the y-intervals.
           
           The "collision" check will focus on how the AABBs of these two interact: if they are overlapping in the x-axis, the maximum position of object 5 must be less than the minimum of object 4, *or* if the minimum of object 5 is greater than the maximum of object 4. The same applies to the y-axis.
           
           Object 4 has a fixed AABB at (0,0) between the bounds of `-0.0358` and `0.0358`.
           Therefore, object 5's placement must be offset away from the region around (0,0). So, to generate placements, I'll test some angles, starting from 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, and pi/2. I’ll push object 5 to the edges and the collision threshold away from (0,0).
           
           For `theta = 0`, I calculate a boundary zone, about `0.0778` away from (0,0). I have an OR condition, so if `x` is in the safe zone, then `y` *must* be out of the safe zone, or vice versa. Therefore, I’ll need to make a good grid with positions outside the forbidden region.
           
           Since the collision situation depends on my calculated parameter `x_coll_threshold = S_4_half + Half_S5_eff`, if `theta = pi/4` and beyond the surface bounds would be smaller than the collision threshold and no placements would be possible.
           
           Only `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/2` will have feasible placements for object 5.
           I'll set my parameters and generate combinations to reach 50 viable placements, as directed.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID: 6) on surface 0, while avoiding collisions with two existing objects (IDs 4 and 5).  To do this, I need to consider several constraints: the object must remain within the surface boundaries, and its bounding box (AABB) mustn't overlap with the AABBs of the fixed obstacles, regardless of its rotation.
           
           First, I define the key parameters: the surface bounds and the dimensions and placement of the existing objects, determining their AABBs. Then, I calculate the effective half-side length for the new object's AABB for different rotation angles. The rotation impacts the bounding box since the object is square. This half-side length will be required to calculate the surface constraints and collision checks later.
           
           To ensure stability and adherence to my constraints, I calculate the boundaries for the object's center, keeping it within the surface, taking into consideration the effective size of the object. My approach is to check many x, y positions at specific rotations (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2).
           
           To efficiently find valid positions, I will evaluate a coordinate grid of x and y values within the surface bounds, checking for collisions at each position and rotation. The collision check uses a function `is_colliding()`, which will tell me if the new object's AABB is overlapping with any existing AABB at a given x, y position, for the current rotation. By checking various positions with various rotation, I will find a set of 50 non-colliding positions for the object.
