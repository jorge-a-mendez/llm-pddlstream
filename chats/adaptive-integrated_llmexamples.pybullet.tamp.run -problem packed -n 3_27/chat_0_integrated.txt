User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.28, -0.317), (-0.197, -0.234)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.238, -0.275, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.108, 0.994).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.155, 0.398, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.86, 0.51).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.203, 0.351), (-0.107, 0.446)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.125, 0.475), (0.218, 0.567)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.171, 0.521, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.213, 0.977).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable objects (v8, v12, v14) that are currently placed on object v11. The goal is to move all three objects onto object v16. Object v11 (table) is a large surface, and object v16 is a smaller surface.
           
           The initial state provides three supported predicates for object #o2, which specifies a common pose for v8, v12, and v14 on either v10 or v16. Since the goal is to place the objects on v16, we will use the pose #o2 supported by v16.
           
           The provided action instances only include a `move_base` action, which moves the robot from v3 to v3 with trajectory #o0. This implies that the robot is already in a suitable position to perform the task or that movement is not required for the actions that will be chosen from the set of actions of the domain `pr2-tamp`. Since the goal is to place the objects and there are no pick or place actions in the `action instances` list, and no kinematic information `kin` is given for any pick or place action, it is not possible to achieve the goal of placing objects using the `pick` and `place` actions. However, `on` is an axiom that is true if `supported` and `atpose` are true. The problem asks to provide a plan to achieve the goal using the actions of the `pr2-tamp` domain. Since the only available action is `move_base`, and it doesn't change the state of the objects or their poses, it is impossible to satisfy the goal of moving the objects onto v16. Therefore, the goal is not achievable.
