User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object

           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object

           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.194, -0.244), (0.284, -0.154)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.279, 0.224), (-0.195, 0.308)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.239, -0.199, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.178, 0.984).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.1, -0.573), (-0.019, -0.492)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.237, 0.266, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.993, -0.114).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.06, -0.532, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.996, -0.085).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Placement**
           
           My goal is to position objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto surface `v16`. Currently, they reside on `v11`. I've analyzed the problem and determined the most efficient approach: a sequential pick-and-place operation for each object using the robot's arm `v4`. The critical part involves calculating collision-free and stable poses for each object on the target surface, `v16`. The plan uses the only available *kin* relationships, with the required base configuration (`v3`), grasp (`#o1`), and trajectory (`#o4`) for all objects.
           
           To achieve this, I'll execute the following steps:
           
           1.  **Object AABB Interpretation:** I'm interpreting the provided axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) for each object as relative *dimensions*, centered at the object's origin. This is a common interpretation that I've used in the plan.
           2.  **Target Pose Calculation (for `#o2`):** For each object (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`), I will calculate a collision-free placement on `v16`. Given `v16` has an AABB spanning from `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`, I will place each object within that extent.
               *   `v14`: Center position at `(-0.07, 0.07, 0.781, 0.0)`. This places it within the bounds of `v16`.
               *   `v8`: Center position at `(0.07, 0.07, 0.781, 0.0)`. This placement is collision-free with `v14` on `v16`.
               *   `v12`: Center position at `(0.0, -0.07, 0.781, 0.0)`. This placement is also collision-free on `v16`.
               *   I'll maintain a consistent *z* value (0.781) and *theta* value (0.0). These target poses enable the `supported(obj, #o2, v16)` predicates to be met, fulfilling the `on(obj, v16)` goal.
           3.  **Plan Execution:**
               *   Pick `v14` from its initial pose.
               *   Place `v14` at the calculated `#o2` pose on `v16`.
               *   Pick `v8` from its initial pose.
               *   Place `v8` at its calculated `#o2` pose on `v16`.
               *   Pick `v12` from its initial pose.
               *   Place `v12` at its calculated `#o2` pose on `v16`.
           
           The total cost will be the sum of 3 `pickcost()` and 3 `placecost()`. No `move_base` actions will be used as their cost is zero in this problem, and no base movement is needed. This optimized strategy ensures that all three objects are successfully positioned on the target surface `v16`. This plan will work under the assumptions of the object poses and collision checks made in my plan.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Plan Infeasibility**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a planning problem and a list of *valid action instances*, but the user is telling me the plan I came up with previously is flawed. Specifically, I see now that my previous attempt used `pick` and `place` actions, which are *not* included in the provided list of valid actions. That's a critical oversight on my part.
           
           Looking at the constraints, the *only* action I have available is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  This means the robot can *only* move its base from `v3` to `v3` using a specific trajectory, which is essentially a no-op! It can't manipulate objects directly with `pick` and `place`.
           
           The goal the user set is to have `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all stacked on top of `v16`. But the current state places those objects on `v11`. Clearly, I need a plan that involves moving them from `v11` to `v16`. Given my limited action space, this is a non-starter. To achieve that stacking, I would need those prohibited `pick` and `place` actions.
           
           Therefore, rather than offering up a plan I know is impossible to execute, I need to communicate to the user *why* the goal is unachievable given the constraints. It's a matter of clearly and concisely stating the action space limitation and its impact on the goal state. No plan can be formulated.
