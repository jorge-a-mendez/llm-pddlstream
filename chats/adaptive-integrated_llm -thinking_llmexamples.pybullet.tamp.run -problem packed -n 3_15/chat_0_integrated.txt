User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.194, -0.244), (0.284, -0.154)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.239, -0.199, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.178, 0.984).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.1, -0.573), (-0.019, -0.492)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.237, 0.266, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.993, -0.114).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.279, 0.224), (-0.195, 0.308)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.06, -0.532, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.996, -0.085).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom arm(v4)

           Atom handempty(v4)

           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)

           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)

           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve the goal of placing objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto surface `v16`. Currently, they're all resting on `v11`.  
           
           My initial approach, given my knowledge of planning, would be to use a combination of `pick` and `place` actions. I'd essentially formulate a plan that involved picking up each object from `v11` and then placing it onto `v16`. I even mapped out what these actions would look like, considering the robot's arms `v4` and `v6`, and a suitable target pose for each object on `v16` (likely using `#o2`).
           
           However, the crucial constraint here is the *limited* set of available actions. I'm *only* allowed to use action instances provided in the list. This is a pretty strict restriction. The problem *explicitly* states that any action instance *not* in that list is off-limits. Unfortunately, the only action I'm given is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.
           
           This means I can only move the robot's base between the same configuration. This doesn't change anything about the objects on any surfaces.
           
           Since I don't have instances of `pick` or `place`, I can't actually move the objects. My usual plan is rendered impossible. I've re-read the problem statement for clarity: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." This is a definitive constraint. Without `pick` and `place`, achieving the goal, which requires moving objects, is simply impossible. The initial and goal state contrast confirms this.
           
           Therefore, and after careful analysis, I conclude that the goal is *unreachable* given the provided action instances. The lack of `pick` and `place` actions is the critical bottleneck. I'll need to explain this in detail.
