               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes two arms, `v4` and `v6`, and several graspable, stackable objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`. There are also two regions, `v10` and `v16`, where objects can be stacked. Initially, objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are all at specific poses (`v9`, `v13`, `v15` respectively) and are supported by `v11`. It seems that `v11` is not a `stackable` region, as the goal is to move the objects onto `v16`.
           
           The goal is to have `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all `on` the object `v16`. The `on` predicate is an axiom, meaning it's true if the object is `supported` by `v16` and is `atpose` a specific pose. This means we need to pick up each object and place it onto `v16` at a suitable pose.
           
           From the initial state, we know `atbconf(v3)` and `canmove()`. We also have `handempty(v4)` and `handempty(v6)`. The only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which doesn't change the base configuration and thus is not useful for picking and placing objects across different locations.
           
           Let's analyze the available `kin` facts. All `kin` facts provided are for arm `v4`. This indicates that `v4` is the arm we should use. There are `kin` facts for `v4` to interact with `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` at their current poses (`v9`, `v13`, `v15`) with a general `grasp` `#o1`. Crucially, there are also `kin` facts for placing these objects at pose `#o2` on `v10` or `v16`.
           
           The problem is that the only allowed action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action effectively does nothing as it moves from `v3` to `v3`. Without `pick` and `place` action instances, or any other `move_base` actions that would allow the robot to reach different locations, it's impossible to move the objects from `v11` to `v16`. Even if there were `pick` and `place` actions, they require a `kin` fact which includes a base configuration `q` that is `atbconf(q)`. Currently, only `v3` is `atbconf`. The `kin` facts provided use `#o3` for the base configuration, which is a continuous parameter that needs to be computed. Even if `#o3` could resolve to `v3`, the `pick` and `place` actions themselves are not in the list of allowed action instances.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the given set of allowed actions.
           
           The goal is not achievable with the provided allowed action instances. The only allowed action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which does not change the state relevant to the goal. There are no `pick` or `place` actions available, which are necessary to move objects from their current location (`v11`) to the target location (`v16`).
