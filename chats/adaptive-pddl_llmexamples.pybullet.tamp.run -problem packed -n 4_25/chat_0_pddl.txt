           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes several objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) that are currently on object v11. The robot has two arms (v4 and v6) and is at a specific base configuration (v3). The goal is to move all four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) onto object v18.
           
           However, the only allowed action instance provided is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action moves the robot's base from configuration v3 to v3 using trajectory #o0. This action does not change the state of any of the objects, nor does it allow for picking or placing objects. Since the goal requires moving objects, and no pick or place actions are available, the goal is unachievable with the given allowed action instances.
           
           It is important to note that the provided initial state also includes `supported` facts for v8, v12, v14, and v16 on both v10 and v18, but their `atpose` facts are on v11. For example, `Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)` means that a pose #o2 exists where v8 would be supported by v18. However, the current pose of v8 is v9, and it is currently supported by v11 (`Atom atpose(v8, v9)` and `Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)`). The goal `on(v8, v18)` means `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)`. To achieve this, a `place` action would be necessary to change the `atpose` of v8 to a pose on v18. Since no `pick` or `place` actions are available, the goal cannot be achieved.
