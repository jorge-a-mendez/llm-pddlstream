           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.177, 0.481), (-0.079, 0.579)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.039, 0.191), (0.045, 0.276)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.254, -0.25), (-0.179, -0.176)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.128, 0.53, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.434, 0.901).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.003, 0.233, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.619, 0.786).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.217, -0.213, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.732, 0.681).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Task at Hand**
           
           I'm faced with a classic robot manipulation problem: get three objects (v8, v12, and v14) onto a target surface (v16) from their initial positions on another surface (v11).  I'm interpreting this as a sequence of pick-and-place actions. The challenge is in the specifics of the constraints and ensuring the plan adheres to the problem's rules regarding multiple placements at a single symbolic pose.
           
           **Breaking Down the Constraints**
           
           All three objects are initially "supported" by v11, and the goal is to have them "on" v16.  This strongly implies I'll be using pick and place operations, with a base "move" to the pickup and release zones. I've also noted that the problem mandates different continuous pose values for the `#o2` symbol, even though they all share that label in the PDDL. This is a crucial distinction.
           
           **Building the Plan**
           
           The core of the plan will be:
           1.  Move the base robot from `v3` to a configuration `#o3` which allows pick and place actions.
           2.  Pick `v8` from pose `v9` and place it on a specific pose on `v16` (let's call it `#o2_v8`).
           3.  Pick `v12` from pose `v13` and place it on a specific pose on `v16` (let's call it `#o2_v12`).
           4.  Pick `v14` from pose `v15` and place it on a specific pose on `v16` (let's call it `#o2_v14`).
           
           I recognize that the `#o2` pose is not just a single point; it's a symbolic pose I need to translate into three *unique* continuous poses.
           
           **Parameter Definitions**
           
           *   `#o0`: Dummy trajectory for base motion.
           *   `#o1`: Generic grasp (no specific value needed).
           *   `#o2`: The target pose on `v16` for each object. I will give it the values described below.
           *   `#o3`: Base configuration. I determined (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) is a reasonable position.
           *   `#o4`: Arm trajectory (no specific value needed).
           
           **Continuous Parameters**
           
           I need to provide continuous values for:
           *   `#o2 v8 v16`: (0.05, 0.05, 0.781, 0.0).
           *   `#o2 v12 v16`: (-0.05, 0.05, 0.781, 0.0).
           *   `#o2 v14 v16`: (0.0, -0.05, 0.781, 0.0).
           
           These positions are within the AABB of `v16`, a small square surface ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)), and ensure a stable placement.
           
           **Action Preconditions**
           
           I've reviewed the preconditions for each action to verify that all the required predicates and facts will be met before execution, using the initial conditions and action effects.
           
           **Cost Analysis**
           
           The plan's cost will be the distance for the `move_base` action (1.0), plus the cost of each pick and place (3 * 1 = 3), resulting in a total cost of 4.0.
           
           **Final Thoughts**
           
           With this plan in place, and a deep understanding of the problem's restrictions, I believe I have a clear and efficient solution.
