(Thoughts: **My Task: Generating 50 Stable Placements for a Rectangular Object on a Surface**
           
           I need to determine the surface index (which is always 0 in this case), the rotation angle, and the (x, y) coordinates for 50 placements of a rectangular object (ID: 4) on a given AABB surface. The surface is centered at (0, 0) and extends from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). The object's dimensions are roughly square, with size_x = 0.0969422334089032 and size_y = 0.09694223340890318.
           
           To ensure the object is *fully* contained within the surface, I've calculated that, I need to consider the half-width and half-height of the object. For a given rotation `theta`, the effective width and height of the bounding box around the rotated object are calculated using trigonometric functions, to include the absolute value of sine and cosine of theta. Then half-width and half-height for object need to be added/subtracted with the surface dimensions.
           
           The object's almost-square shape simplifies things. The maximum extent of the bounding box will occur at a rotation of π/4 radians (45 degrees), and, the object will have maximum edge-to-edge extent in the diagonal dimension, or square root of 2 times one edge. For this particular setup, this will be 0.137090333 units. Since the surface spans an entire length of 0.27 units in both axes, this means that even with maximal rotation the object will easily fit inside the surface.
           
           I've determined the valid ranges for the x and y coordinates of the object's center. To do this I needed to determine valid `theta` values. The rotation of the box repeats its bounding box every PI/2 radians, and values within [0, PI/2] are thus sufficient.
           
           I've chosen to distribute the 50 placements among 5 angles, namely 0, π/6, π/4, π/3, and π/2. Each angle gets 10 positions. For the x and y coordinates, I calculate the `linspace_points`, which automatically calculates the end points if I've provided it with the `min` and `max` values to the valid range. In addition, I ensure this range is evenly covered via an even grid to ensure a uniform coverage within the available surface area. This will give me a good distribution, and the object's square-like shape makes it unlikely that the specific chosen positions will be unstable from collision with its own bounding box.
           
           In the end I'll have 50 unique placements across the specified theta values for the given AABB dimensions. All placements are guaranteed to be stable since they are within the surface bounds.

(Thoughts: **Final Placement Strategy for Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've received confirmation that the scene is as I expect it, with object 4 successfully placed. Now, I need to find 50 stable placements for object 5, a smaller, near-square object.  I'm dealing with the same surface, but importantly, I *must* avoid any collision with object 4, which is now a fixed obstacle at its current location.
           
           Object 4 has been placed in the bottom left corner, with coordinates roughly `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(-0.038, -0.038)`. This area is a no-go zone.
           
           The object 5 is slightly smaller than object 4. I know that the max effective size depends on object's rotation.
           
           Now, my strategy: I'll generate 50 points by strategically placing them in the valid area, which is the surface excluding the space occupied by object 4. To accomplish this, I'll calculate the clearance, based on object 4's bounding box and the rotation-dependent dimensions of object 5.
           
           For each rotation angle, I'll calculate a clearance threshold such that any placement that has its center beyond this threshold should guarantee no collision. Essentially, I'll work mostly in the top right, where the non-collision conditions are easiest to maintain, as a quick way to generate valid positions.
           
           I'll pick 5 angles, namely 0, PI/6, PI/4, PI/3 and PI/2.
           For each angle, I will generate 5 `x` coordinates and 2 `y` coordinates.
           To make sure those points are valid (that is, the object does not collide with object 4), I'll make sure that object 5's placement is at least as far to the right or above as the edges of object 4. That means for each placement, either the x coordinate of the center has to be far enough right, or the y coordinate of the center has to be high enough, given the current rotation.  For most of the cases, this comes down to generating points in the positive region of x and y.
           
           So the plan: for each of the rotations 0, PI/6, PI/4, PI/3, and PI/2, I'll create 10 placements. This method allows for both efficient generation and a quick collision check, while exploring different rotation angles. The generation will work through a process of generating x and y values, and then making sure the positions are away from the placement region of object 4, such that collision avoidance is guaranteed.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single surface (surface 0) defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. There are two previously placed objects that act as obstacles:
           
           *   **Object 4 (ID: 4):** Placed at `(0, 0.0, -0.0865288832955484, -0.08652888329554841)`. Its dimensions are `0.0969422334089032` x `0.09694223340890318`. With `theta=0`, its AABB is `[-0.135, -0.0380577665910968] x [-0.135, -0.03805776659109682]`. This object occupies the bottom-left corner of the surface.
           
           *   **Object 5 (ID: 5):** Placed at `(0, 0.0, 0.000827742156189295, 0.00082774215618926)`. Its dimensions are `0.07777101749457219` x `0.07777101749457216`. With `theta=0`, its AABB is `[-0.0380577665910968, 0.03971325090347539] x [-0.03805776659109682, 0.03971325090347534]`. This object is placed adjacent to Object 4, touching its top-right corner, and extending into the central-bottom-left region of the surface.
           
           The new object (ID: 7) has dimensions `0.09828709785590364` x `0.09828709785590362`. This is a slightly larger object than ID 4.
           
           My detailed analysis suggests that, under standard AABB non-overlap definitions, object 7 is too large to fit in the remaining space of surface 0 without colliding with either object 4 or object 5. Specifically:
           1.  Object 7's minimum width/height (`0.098287...`) is greater than the available width/height `0.096942...` to the left of `x_4_max` or below `y_4_max`. This means it cannot be placed fully to the left of or fully below Object 4.
           2.  Object 7's minimum width/height (`0.098287...`) is also greater than the available width/height `0.095286...` to the right of `x_5_max` or above `y_5_max`. This means it cannot be placed fully to the right of or fully above Object 5.
           
           This leads to a situation where any placement that is within the surface bounds will necessarily have AABB overlap with either object 4 or object 5, or both. Since the problem requires me to provide placements and "never give up", there might be a subtle interpretation of "collision" or a floating point tolerance I am not accounting for, or the non-fixed nature of objects implies some dynamic movement not fully described by static AABBs.
           
           Therefore, I will generate 50 placements for Object 7 that are safely contained within the primary surface (Surface 0) but may, according to my strict geometric analysis, collide with the existing objects. This will allow the system to provide feedback on which, if any, of these placements are considered valid.
           
           The maximum effective dimension (W or H) of object 7, considering all rotations, is achieved at `theta = PI/4`, where `W = H = 0.09828709785590364 * cos(PI/4) + 0.09828709785590362 * sin(PI/4) = 0.13899999999999997`.
           Half of this dimension is `0.0695`.
           The surface extends from `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           For object 7 to be fully contained, its center `(x, y)` must satisfy:
           `surf_lower_x + W/2 <= x <= surf_upper_x - W/2`
           `surf_lower_y + H/2 <= y <= surf_upper_y - H/2`
           Using the maximum `W/2 = 0.0695`, the valid range for `x` and `y` centers is `[-0.135 + 0.0695, 0.135 - 0.0695] = [-0.0655, 0.0655]`.
           I will generate placements using a diverse set of angles (`0`, `PI/6`, `PI/4`, `PI/3`, `PI/2`) and sample `(x, y)` from within this conservative `[-0.0655, 0.0655]` range.
