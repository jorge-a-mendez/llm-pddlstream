(Thoughts: **Stable Placements for Object 5 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to determine 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5) with dimensions `size_x = 0.09678761983154949` and `size_y = 0.09678761983154943` on surface 0, defined by the bounds `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. Stability requires that the object is entirely contained within the surface.
           
           I've determined that the surface index will remain constant at 0.  Since `size_x` and `size_y` are nearly identical (the object is effectively square), the optimal approach involves analyzing the critical orientations, `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/2`.  These angles maximize the placement space available.  Because the object is nearly square, other angles offer little added value.
           
           For `theta = 0`, I calculated the half-extents, deriving the permissible ranges for the object's center `x` and `y` coordinates. The allowable ranges are approximately `-0.0866` to `0.0866` for both `x` and `y`.
           
           Then, I calculated the allowed ranges for when `theta = pi/2`. The nearly identical shape means that the allowable ranges stay approximately the same. 
           
           I've generated a 5x5 grid of `x` and `y` coordinates for the two angles and will use these to generate the placements (surf_idx, theta, x, y).
           To ensure a sufficient spread, a set of points for both cases should cover the total 50 placements as needed. The final output is a set of placements (surf_idx, theta, x, y). The surface index always remain as surf_idx=0.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object ID 4**
           
           My primary objective is to generate 50 stable placements for a *new* object (ID 4) on Surface 0, which has the dimensions `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I'm going to assume that any previous placement of object ID 5 isn't relevant to this current task, as I have no indication that it's a fixed obstacle. The extents of object ID 4 are `(0.09755964880074051, 0.09755964880074053)`, making it nearly square, much like the previous object.
           
           I'll employ the same strategy as before: I will first compute the maximum half-extents of the object after it is rotated by `theta`, then I will define a grid of valid `x` and `y` positions.
           
           Let's do some calculations. I've got `surf_x_min = -0.135`, `surf_x_max = 0.135`, `surf_y_min = -0.135`, `surf_y_max = 0.135`, `obj_sx = 0.09755964880074051`, and `obj_sy = 0.09755964880074053`.  So, the half-extents are `h_sx = 0.048779824400370255` and `h_sy = 0.048779824400370265`.
           
           When `theta` is `0`:
           *   `rhw = h_sx = 0.048779824400370255`
           *   `rhh = h_sy = 0.048779824400370265`
           *   The valid x-range is from `-0.08622017559962974` to `0.08622017559962974`.
           *   The valid y-range is from `-0.08622017559962973` to `0.08622017559962973`.
           
           When `theta` is `pi/2`:
           *   `rhw = h_sy = 0.048779824400370265`
           *   `rhh = h_sx = 0.048779824400370255`
           *   The valid x-range is from `-0.08622017559962973` to `0.08622017559962973`.
           *   The valid y-range is from `-0.08622017559962974` to `0.08622017559962974`.
           
           Since the object is almost a perfect square, the ranges are nearly identical. A 5x5 grid for each orientation will be used.
           
           For `theta = 0`, I'll calculate the x and y steps for the grids.
           *   The x range length is `0.17244035119925949`
           *   The y range length is `0.17244035119925947`
           *   The x step is approximately `0.04311008779981487`
           *   The y step is approximately `0.0431100877998148675`
           
           I can quickly determine the grids for each orientation:
           `x_values = [-0.08622017559962974, -0.04311008779981487, 0.0, 0.04311008779981487,

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object ID 6**
           
           Okay, so I've got a task: place 50 stable instances of object ID 6 on Surface 0. This is pretty straightforward, but I need to be careful. The trick is that I've already placed objects ID 4 and ID 5, and the rules say I have to avoid collisions with those, now considered *fixed obstacles*. This means I can't just throw placements down anywhere.
           
           First, I looked at the previously placed objects. Their sizes and positions are key. ID 5 has size of 0.0967 x 0.0967, and ID 4 has 0.0975 x 0.0975. Using the placement data for ID 5 and ID 4, I quickly calculate their AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes). These AABBs are crucial because they define the "no-go" zones for ID 6.
           
           I found something interesting. Both AABBs were in the bottom left corner and nearly overlapping! This told me that the previous placements were close to each other, and it's essential to understand the combined obstacle space. Since I have `theta = 0`, I can calculate the safe zone with these parameters.
           
           With my calculations, I can work out that the objects are perfectly square, but to maximize space I should use `theta = 0` or `theta = pi/2`.  No rotation needed here.
           
           So, I determined the forbidden region (overlapping the previous placements) and the valid placement zone on the surface. Now it's about generating a good set of (x, y) coordinates for the new placements, ensuring they don't overlap with any.
           
           Given my calculations, I can create an L-shaped safe space to work with, avoiding the corner where previous placements were.
           
           My process of placement creation needs to generate and place coordinates within the safe L shape I worked out. I'll make sure each x, y coordinate will avoid overlapping with the earlier objects and be valid placement sites. The generated placements will meet requirements to place the correct number of objects on the surface. These coordinates, when applied to a `theta = 0` orientation should give 50 stable placements. I will make sure the placement points are uniformly placed, where possible.
           
           Using this method, I should be able to generate the 50 placements successfully. It's all about respecting the "no-collision" rule and using the available space efficiently.
