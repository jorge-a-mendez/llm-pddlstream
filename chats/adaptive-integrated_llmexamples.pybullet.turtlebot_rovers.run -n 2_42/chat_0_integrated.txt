           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The task is to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom representing a complex set of conditions including `receivedimage` for two objectives, `receivedanalysis` for two types of rocks, and the `atconf` and `free` predicates for both rovers and the store.
           
           Looking at the initial state and available action instances, we have two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, and one store, `v16`. Both rovers are at their respective initial configurations `v13` and `v15`, and both are `free` with respect to `v16`. There are multiple rocks of different types (`v2` and `v6`). We also have `camera v10` on board both rovers, which `supports` `v11` mode. There is a `lander v9`.
           
           The given action instances are only `move` and `drop_rock`. This immediately tells us that we cannot achieve the goal as described by `new-axiom@0()`. `new-axiom@0()` requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates to be true. To achieve `receivedimage`, we need to use `take_image` and `send_image` actions. To achieve `receivedanalysis`, we need to use `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` actions. None of these actions are available in the provided list of valid action instances. Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the given set of allowed actions.
           
           The presence of continuous parameters starting with '#' like `#o0`, `#o1`, `#o2`, `#o3`, `#o4`, `#o5` in the initial state and motion predicates is for cases where actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` would be used. Since these actions are not allowed, the specific values for these continuous parameters are irrelevant.
           
           The goal cannot be achieved with the given available actions.
