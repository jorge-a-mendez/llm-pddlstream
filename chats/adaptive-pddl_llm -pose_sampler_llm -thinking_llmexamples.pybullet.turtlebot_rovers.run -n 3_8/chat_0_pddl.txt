           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Breakdown of the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with the goal `new-axiom@0()`.  Let's dissect this, starting with its definition. It's a conjunction of several conditions, with the core being about acquiring images (`receivedimage`) and analyses (`receivedanalysis`). My immediate thought is, "How do I trigger these?" I need to look at the relevant actions - specifically, `send_image` and `send_analysis`.  This feels straightforward, right?  Get images, get analyses, problem solved.  But the devil is in the details, as usual.
           
           **Examining the State and Identifying the Obstacles**
           
           The initial state, surprisingly, already satisfies most of the conditions within `new-axiom@0()`. That's a nice start! However, the crux of the problem lies in the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates, which necessitate the `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions. Let's dig deeper into the prerequisites for these actions.
           
           Both actions require the rovers to be in specific configurations denoted by `atconf(?v, ?q)`. The critical thing here is that the 'q' values must match the communications configurations.  For example, `send_image` necessitates `atconf(v, #o0)`. The initial state gives us `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`. The only available "move" actions don't change these configurations; they just re-state them. This raises a major red flag.
           
           **Analyzing the Move Actions and the Crucial Observation**
           
           The only "move" actions I have just keep the rover in the same config. They don't let me *change* the configuration. And that's the kicker! They only allow the rover to be re-stated at the same config. The communication configs for `send_image` and `send_analysis`  are *not* the rover's current configuration. This means, I'm stuck. No move action can alter the current configurations to satisfy the `atconf` preconditions. I'm essentially boxed in.
           
           **Implications of the Configuration Conundrum**
           
           Since I can't meet the `atconf` requirements, I can't execute `send_image` or `send_analysis`. Thus, I can't fulfill the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates, the ultimate goal. Therefore,  `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable.
           
           **A Detailed Re-evaluation**
           
           To be absolutely sure, I've re-read the action instances. There are only two types: movement (which doesn't actually change config) and "drop_rock". I've re-examined the preconditions, including the need to be "free", where the rover already starts "free". Nothing here changes the fundamental problem.
           
           **The Inevitable Conclusion**
           
           Given the limited set of available actions and the current configuration constraints, it's impossible to reach the goal. I cannot manipulate the rovers' states to enable the core communication and analysis actions. It would be different if I could change configurations! But I cannot.
           
           Therefore, `new-axiom@0()` is not achievable. This conclusion is based on the initial configuration, the action instances, and the preconditions of the required actions. It's a sad but unavoidable outcome.
