           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v15`. `v8` is currently at `v9` and supported by `v11`. `v12` is at `v13` and supported by `v14`. `v15` is at `v16` and supported by `v11`. `v8`, `v12`, and `v15` are all stackable on `v10` and `v18`. All three objects are of `type v17`. There are two arms: `v4` and `v6`, both are handempty and at their respective home configurations. The robot's base is at `v3`.
           
           The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which, according to the axioms, is true if `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. In this specific problem, `?green` can be any of `v8`, `v12`, or `v15` since they are all of `type v17`. The condition `on(?green, v18)` expands to `supported(?green, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(?green, ?p)`.
           
           Looking at the initial state, we already have `type(v8, v17)`, `type(v12, v17)`, and `type(v15, v17)`. We also have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. However, `v8` is currently at `v9` and `v12` is at `v13`. Neither of these objects are currently at a pose that is supported by `v18`. Therefore, to achieve the goal, we need to place either `v8` or `v12` onto `v18`. The object `v15` is not supported on `v18` in the initial state so we cannot use it.
           
           There are no pick or place actions available in the list of allowed action instances. The only available action is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, which does not change the state of any object or the robot's arm, but only moves the base from `v3` to `v3`. Since we cannot pick up and place any object, and no object is initially on `v18` at a supported pose, the goal is unreachable.
           
           --Plan--:

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.
