(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0.  Since the object is square (0.07 x 0.07), its bounding box is also a square, but the size changes with rotation. To be safe, I’ll use the *maximum* possible bounding box size (when the object is rotated 45 degrees), which is 0.07 * sqrt(2) * 0.5 = ~0.0495  for the half-side length. This ensures that *any* rotation will fit inside the surface bounds.
           
           The surface 0 dimensions are defined by ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  So, I calculate the safe region for the object's center (x, y) by subtracting this maximum half-extent from the surface bounds. This gives me a rectangular area within the surface where I can place the object.  The range for `x` is roughly from `4.25` to `4.75`, and for `y` is from `-0.55` to `-0.05`.
           
           Now, for the actual placements.  I'll create an 8x7 grid of 56 points within the safe region, and pick the first 50.  Then, I'll assign a diverse set of 10 rotation angles (0 to 2*pi in equal steps) to these placement points. I am picking 10 different angles so that I can have multiple angles for each position, ensuring diversity.
           
           This guarantees that each placement will be stable and that I meet the requested number of placements. I now just need to loop over the grid, assign each point, and then report the results.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 10**
           
           Based on the feedback and the need to avoid collisions with the previously placed object (ID 5), I've refined the placement strategy for the new object (ID 10) with dimensions `0.072985 x 0.072985`.  The critical factors are:
           
           1.  **Object Dimensions and AABB:** Given the near-square shape of ID 10 and ID 5, I'm using the maximum effective side length for the Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) calculation, using a side length of `S = 0.072985`.  This leads to a maximum half-extent of `max_half_extent_ID10 = S \* sqrt(2) / 2 =  0.051606`. Similarly, for ID 5, the AABB has `max_half_extent_ID5 = 0.049497`.
           
           2.  **Surface Constraints:**  The available surface is defined as `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))` with a width of 0.6 and a height of 0.6. With the maximum half extent, the original safe ranges for ID 10 were  `x_min = 4.251606`, `x_max = 4.748394`, `y_min = -0.548394`, `y_max = -0.051606`.
           
           3.  **Collision Avoidance:** The key is avoiding collisions with the successful placements of ID 5, and it occupies a significant portion of surface 0. Successful placements of object ID 5 form two rows. The first row covers the *x* axis from 4.2 to 4.8 and *y* range from -0.6 to -0.501, and the second row covers the *x* axis from 4.2 to 4.37 and *y* range from -0.516 to -0.417. To be certain of avoiding collisions, it's essential to define the bounding boxes for these placements and ensure that ID 10's AABB doesn't overlap. To be conservative, I am using  `max_half_extent_ID5` to calculate the AABB for each placement for the avoidance checks.
           
           4.  **Updated Safe Placement Range:** Because the lower portion of surface 0 is occupied, the safe *y* range for ID 10 must be adjusted. The lower bound of the y-range for ID 10 becomes  `y_min = -0.365883` to ensure that it's placed above the occupied area. The safe center bounds for ID 10 are: `x_min = 4.251606`, `x_max = 4.748394`, `y_min = -0.365883`, and `y_max = -0.051606`.
           
           5.  **Placement Grid:**  With the new constraints, I will generate a placement grid with 8 x positions (x_coords) and 7 y positions (y_coords), for 56 positions. The final placements will consist of 50. I will cycle through 10 angles.
