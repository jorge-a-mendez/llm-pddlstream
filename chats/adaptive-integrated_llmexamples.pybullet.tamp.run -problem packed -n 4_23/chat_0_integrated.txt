User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.235, 0.233), (-0.137, 0.331)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.175, -0.362), (0.262, -0.276)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.021, 0.335), (0.077, 0.433)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.186, 0.282, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.442, 0.897).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.114, 0.245), (0.202, 0.332)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.218, -0.319, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.137, 0.991).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.028, 0.384, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.431, 0.903).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.158, 0.288, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.595, 0.803).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains a base configuration `v3` and two arms `v4` and `v6`. There are four graspable objects: `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`. They are currently placed on `v11` at poses `v9`, `v13`, `v15`, and `v17` respectively. The goal is to place all four objects on `v18`. Since `v18` is an object, it's likely a smaller surface (like a tray) that the objects need to be stacked onto. All objects are stackable with `v18`. The robot can pick and place objects using either arm. The only available motion action is a null motion of the base, indicating the robot is already in a good position or doesn't need to move for this task.
           
           The initial state provides `pose(obj, #o2)` for all four objects and `supported(obj, #o2, v18)`. This indicates that `#o2` is the target pose on `v18` for all objects. However, since the goal requires all four objects to be `on(obj, v18)`, and `on` is defined as `supported` and `atpose`, we will need to place each object at a *distinct* pose on `v18`. Therefore, the current `#o2` should be interpreted as a placeholder for potentially multiple distinct poses. Since no other specific poses on `v18` are given, I will define new poses for each object to be placed on `v18`.
           
           I will use arm `v4` to pick and place objects.
           
           Here's a plan:
           1. Pick `v8` from `v9` on `v11`.
           2. Place `v8` at a new pose, say `#p0`, on `v18`.
           3. Pick `v12` from `v13` on `v11`.
           4. Place `v12` at a new pose, say `#p1`, on `v18`.
           5. Pick `v14` from `v15` on `v11`.
           6. Place `v14` at a new pose, say `#p2`, on `v18`.
           7. Pick `v16` from `v17` on `v11`.
           8. Place `v16` at a new pose, say `#p3`, on `v18`.
           
           I will need to define `kin` for each pick and place action, and `grasp` for each object. The initial state provides `grasp(obj, #o1)` for all objects, and since it is a single grasp, it implies that the robot only has one grasp type. I'll need to define new `kin` values for each action, so I'll just use dummy values as they are not provided. The `basemotion` is only a null motion, so I'll assume the robot's base configuration `v3` is suitable for all pick and place operations without further movement.
           
           The objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16` have AABBs:
           `v8`: ((-0.235, 0.233), (-0.137, 0.331)) -> width = 0.098, length = 0.098
           `v12`: ((0.114, 0.245), (0.202, 0.332)) -> width = 0.088, length = 0.087
           `v14`: ((-0.021, 0.335), (0.077, 0.433)) -> width = 0.098, length = 0.098
           `v16`: ((0.175, -0.362), (0.262, -0.276)) -> width = 0.087, length = 0.086
           
           The target surface `v18` has AABB: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). This is a square with side length 0.27. I can place all four objects on `v18` with proper spacing. I will place them in a 2x2 grid on `v18`. The `z` value for placing on `v18` needs to be calculated based on the height of `v18` itself, which isn't explicitly given. However, typical z-coordinates for placing objects on tables are around 0.781 (like the initial poses). I'll assume `v18` is at the same height as `v11` for simplicity (or at least the `z` value 0.781 is relative to the surface and not the world origin, so the actual surface height is subtracted later). For the purpose of providing poses, I will use a z-coordinate of 0.781.
           
           I will define the poses for each object on `v18` as follows, keeping them within the bounds of `v18`:
           `#p0` for `v8`: (-0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           `#p1` for `v12`: (0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           `#p2` for `v14`: (-0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           `#p3` for `v16`: (0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #k0) , (place v4 v8 #p0 #o1 v3 #k1) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #k2) , (place v4 v12 #p1 #o1 v3 #k3) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #k4) , (place v4 v14 #p2 #o1 v3 #k5) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #k6) , (place v4 v16 #p3 #o1 v3 #k7)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The only available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which is a null motion of the robot's base. This means the robot cannot pick up or place any objects, clean them, or cook them. Since the goal requires placing objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto `v18` (i.e., changing their `atpose` predicate), and the only available action is `move_base` which does not change object poses or robot's grip, the goal is unreachable. The robot cannot perform any manipulation tasks with the given set of valid actions.
