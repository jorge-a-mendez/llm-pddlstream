           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene has a large square boundary defined by obstacles 0-4. Obstacle 5 is a thin vertical wall in the center. Obstacles 6-10 are relatively large obstacles in specific quadrants. Obstacles 11-20 are smaller obstacles scattered around. I should try to avoid placing the robot within 2 units of the target point directly on top of or too close to any of these obstacles. I will prioritize positions that are clearly in open spaces and have a good line of sight to the target. I will also try to vary the positions to cover different angles around the target.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     The previous attempts were far from the target point and likely failed due to occlusions by the central wall (obstacle 5) and other obstacles. The new target point is (-1.8659321069717407, 1.8544378280639648), which is in the upper-left quadrant. This means I should focus on positions within a 2-unit radius around this point, carefully considering the obstacles in that region. Obstacles 8, 10, 11, 19, and 20 are in this general area. I need to find positions that are clear of these and also provide a line of sight. Given the target's y-coordinate is quite high, I should aim for positions also with a high y-coordinate, but potentially to the left, right, or slightly below the target to avoid obstacles immediately next to it. I'll try positions closer to the target this time.

Model:     The previous attempts were still too far from the target or were trying to cross the central wall. The target is (-1.8659321069717407, 1.8544378280639648). This is in the upper-left quadrant. I should aim for positions closer to the target that are not immediately adjacent to obstacles 8, 10, 11, or 19. I'll try to find positions directly to the left or right of the target, within the 2-unit radius. The previous failed positions were too far from the target and likely were occluded by obstacles in the middle of the scene. I will try to stay in the upper-left quadrant this time.

Model:     The target point is now (0.42683809995651245, 1.921217679977417). This is in the upper-right quadrant, close to obstacle 9 and 20, and relatively close to the central wall (obstacle 5). The previous attempts for a different target were far off. For this new target, (-2.0, 1.0), (-2.2, 1.5), and (-1.0, 1.5) all failed, likely due to line of sight issues because they were on the wrong side of the central wall. I need to find positions in the upper-right quadrant, within a 2-unit radius of the target, avoiding obstacles 5, 9, and 20.
