(Thoughts: **Stable Object Placements on a Surface**
           
           My task is to find 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, nearly a square with side ~0.09895) on a square surface (surface 0, centered at (0,0) with side 0.27).  Stability means the object is fully contained within the surface and doesn't collide with any other placed objects (currently none).  Since I have the luxury of a completely empty space, and the object's dimensions relative to the surface are easily handled, finding 50 stable placements should be straightforward.
           
           First, I analyzed the surface and object's dimensions.  I quickly determined that the object is essentially a square, which simplifies the calculations. For placement, I need to define the surface index, rotation angle (theta), x-coordinate, and y-coordinate.  I know that by varying the values, I should be able to get 50 different placements.
           
           To ensure the object remains within the surface, I considered the AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) of the object for any given rotation. The maximum extent of the AABB changes with rotation. I realized I needed to calculate how the object's width and height will impact the bounding box. It changes as I rotate.
           
           For `theta = 0` (or multiples of pi/2), the AABB side lengths are simply the original `x` and `y` object dimensions. I can easily calculate a region where the object's center must lie.  Similarly, I calculated the bounds for `theta = pi/4`, which is when the AABB's dimensions are maximized.
           
           My strategy is to utilize the ranges I computed to select several well-spaced points.
           
           The calculation went like this:
           1. I chose a reasonable spacing for the coordinates given the boundaries I calculated for the coordinates.
           2. I determined a set of values for `x` and `y` for `theta=0`, creating 25 positions.
           3. For the rotation, I selected `pi/4`.
           4.  I determined a new, more constrained area for the coordinates, calculating its limits.
           5. I chose a set of values for `x` and `y` for `theta=pi/4`, creating another 25 positions.
           
           This strategy ensures that the object stays within the surface at all times.  The calculations were done carefully to make sure that none of the points overlap.
           
           The result is a set of 50 distinct, stable object placements represented as tuples `(surface_index, theta, x, y)`.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Avoiding Collisions and Ensuring Stability**
           
           I've been tasked with placing a new object (ID 4) onto surface 0, while carefully considering a critical constraint: avoiding collision with a *fixed obstacle*—object ID 5, already placed at (0, 0.0, -0.08, -0.08). My strategy revolves around ensuring the new object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) remains fully within the surface's boundaries and, most importantly, doesn't intersect with the pre-existing obstacle's AABB.
           
           Object ID 5, being the fixed obstacle, is positioned with an AABB from roughly (-0.13, -0.13) to (-0.03, -0.03), centered at (-0.08, -0.08).  I need to calculate the bounding boxes and their dimensions to calculate for collisions. 
           
           The new object (ID 4) presents a square shape with a size of roughly 0.084 units. For stable placement (i.e. not hitting anything else), it must fit within the bounds of surface 0, which extends from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  I calculate that by rotating the new object by *any* 90 degree increment, it will still have an AABB dimensions. To calculate for collisions, I have to ensure the center positions of the new objects are carefully chosen.
           
           To avoid collision, I need to place object ID 4 such that its center is beyond a certain distance from the fixed object ID 5. This distance is determined by the size of the objects. I pre-calculated and will create:
            1.  Placement Locations at `theta = 0` (5 values for x, 3 values for y.  15 placements)
            2.  Placement Locations at `theta = pi/2` (5 values for x, 3 values for y. 15 placements)
            3.  Placement Locations at `theta = pi` (5 values for x, 3 values for y.  15 placements)
            4.  Placement Locations at `theta = pi/4` (2 placements).
           These should all be distinct, and no collisions.  I will ensure this by a test, before placement is returned.
           
           The new placement positions are:
           -  (0.04, 0.08)
           -  (0.08, 0.04)
           -  (0.08, -0.04)
           -  (0.08, 0.0)
           -  (0.04, -0.08)
           -  (0.04, 0.0)
           -  (-0.04, 0.08)
           -  (-0.04, 0.04)
           -  (0.0, 0.08)
           -  (0.04, -0.04)
           -  (0.04, -0.0)
           -  (0.0, 0.04)
           -  (0.0, 0.08)
           -  (-0.08, 0.04)
           -  (-0.08, 0.08)
           -  (-0.04, 0.04)
           -  (0.03, -0.07) for `theta = pi/4`
           -  (0.07, -0.03) for `theta = pi/4`

(Thoughts: **Finalized Placement Strategy for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for this new object (ID 6) on surface 0, while keeping in mind the existing obstacles (IDs 4 and 5) that are fixed in place. The surface is a square of size 0.27 centered at (0,0).
           
           First, I defined the constraints: ensure object 6 stays within the surface bounds, and it doesn't collide with the other objects, no matter the rotation.
           
           Here's the approach I'll take:
           
           **Axis-Aligned Placements (Theta = 0 and Pi/2):**
           
           1.  I found the "safe" regions for object 6's center, (x, y), where it can be without colliding. The key is to avoid the collision regions for both objects:
               *   Object 5's collision: Center `(-0.08, -0.08)`, Size 0.09895. Collision happens when the center lies within a rectangle.
               *   Object 4's collision: Center `(-0.08, 0.04)`, Size 0.083995. Collision happens when the center lies within a rectangle.
           2.  I performed precise calculations to define the boundary conditions for both (x and y) centers
           3.  I generated a finely-spaced grid of points and tested each point to see if it causes a collision.
           4.  I used a combination of grid-based search and precise collision detection rules.
           5.  I ended up with 31 valid placements for this axis-aligned orientation.
           6.  Since a 90-degree rotation of a square doesn't change anything, these same 31 points also work for rotations of Pi/2.
           
           **Rotated Placements (Theta = Pi/4):**
           
           1.  I used collision rules similar to before.
           2.  Because the surface bound limits are more strict, for the rotated placements, I considered grid point pairs with larger spacing
           3.  I generated points and repeated the collision tests.
           4.  Then, I took the first 19 valid placements from my list to meet the target of 50.
           
           So the final solution is: 31 placements at 0 degrees, and 19 placements at 90 degrees.
