           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unachievable Given Constraints**
           
           My task is to create a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which requires several conditions to be met simultaneously.  I immediately recognize that four of these conditions, `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, and `free(v14, v16)`, are already true in the initial state. However, the other six conditions, particularly those involving `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`, are where the challenge lies.
           
           To satisfy `receivedimage(?o, ?m)`, I would need to use the `send_image` action, which itself relies on `take_image` and ultimately, `calibrate`. Similarly, `receivedanalysis` requires the `send_analysis` action, which I do not initially have access to. I then go deeper into the plan to explore these actions. I carefully evaluated the preconditions for `calibrate`, `take_image`, and `send_image` to understand the dependencies. For example, to get a image, the rover needs to be calibrated, then take an image, then send the image.
           
           The initial state provides many helpful clues, but they also highlight a critical constraint. For instance, the rovers (`v12` and `v14`) are currently at specific configurations (`v13` and `v15`, respectively). The available `move` actions, which seem to be the primary tools for state change, only allow the rovers to *remain* at their current configurations. They can't move to other configurations, such as `#o3` or `#o0`, which are needed for actions like `take_image` and `send_image`. This is an unexpected limitation.
           
           The allowed actions are only move and drop_rock!
           
           This makes sense based on the problem statement that all action instances must come from a given list, the "valid action instances." The given list of instances is critical: if an action is not on the list, it cannot be used.
           
           **The Crucial Constraint and the Unachievable Goal**
           
           I reviewed the available action instances and found only `move` and `drop_rock`. I have no way to calibrate, take images, send images or send analysis. Given this severe limitation, itâ€™s clear that I cannot achieve the goal.  Without `send_image` and `send_analysis`, I cannot achieve the goal's conditions regarding receiving images and analyses. The rovers are stuck at their initial configurations. I conclude that the `new-axiom@0()` goal is unachievable given the constraints of the available actions.
