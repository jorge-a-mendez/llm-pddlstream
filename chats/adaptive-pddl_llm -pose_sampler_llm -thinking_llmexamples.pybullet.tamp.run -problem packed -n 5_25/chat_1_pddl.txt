           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unattainable Goal Due to Action Restrictions**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: get all these objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) onto object v20.  My initial assessment is straightforward: I need to use a `place` action. To `place`, I need to be `holding` the object, and to `hold`, I need to `pick` it up first.  Standard TAMP stuff.
           
           Looking at the current situation, everything I need seems to be there: I've got robot arms (v4 and v6), they're both empty, I've got a base configuration (v3), the objects to move, their poses, and the target pose on v20.  I've also got the necessary `kin` facts for arm v4, providing me with the means to move each object.
           
           Initially, my plan was simple: pick up each object from its current position on v11, and then place it onto v20.  The preconditions for `pick` and `place` seem to hold true. I mean, I have `atbconf(v3)`, handempty(v4), and everything looks good!
           
           Then, I come across this tricky constraint: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."  The only valid action instance I'm given is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This single action does nothing to help me achieve my objective. It simply changes the current "canmove" status and base configuration, which is not really helpful.
           
           In my view, while the structure of a solution is clear – using `pick` and `place` actions – these actions *aren't* valid instances because they aren't explicitly provided in the allowed list. Therefore, I can't construct the plan that solves the initial goal.
           
           Given the rigid restriction on using only the provided action instance, and the fact that it doesn't help me reach my goal, I'm forced to conclude that the goal is currently unreachable.  A bit of a head-scratcher!
