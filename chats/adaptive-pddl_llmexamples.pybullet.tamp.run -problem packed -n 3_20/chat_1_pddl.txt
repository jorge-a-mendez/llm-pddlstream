           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes several objects (v8, v12, v14) that are graspable and stackable. These objects are currently at specific poses (v8 at v9, v12 at v13, v14 at v15) and are supported by v11. There are also two arms, v4 and v6, both of which are handempty. The goal is to place all three objects (v8, v12, v14) onto v16.
           
           Looking at the initial state, we have objects v8, v12, and v14 on v11 (since they are supported by v11 at their current poses). The goal is to move them to be on v16.
           
           The only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not directly involve picking or placing objects. It only moves the base from one configuration to the same configuration, essentially a no-op that takes a certain cost. Since there are no pick or place actions available that are parameterized to allow moving the objects, and the `clean` and `cook` actions are also not relevant or available for this goal, it is impossible to achieve the goal of changing the support of objects from v11 to v16. The `on` predicate depends on the `supported` and `atpose` predicates. To change the `supported` predicate to v16, we would need to pick up and place the objects. However, there are no available `pick` or `place` actions in the provided list.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the given set of available action instances.
