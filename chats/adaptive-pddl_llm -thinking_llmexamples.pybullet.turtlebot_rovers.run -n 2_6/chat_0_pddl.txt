           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Plan's Feasibility**
           
           My initial analysis focused on constructing a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, breaking it down into sub-goals and identifying the necessary actions. I carefully examined the initial state and the preconditions of the relevant actions, like `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`, considering objects like rovers, cameras, objectives, and communication modes. I needed to ensure that the rovers remained in their starting configurations to comply with the initial state and the goal's requirements.
           
           Initially, I devised a plan involving a calibration step, taking images, sending the images, sampling rocks, sending analyses, and dropping rocks, which seemed logical given the available predicates and relationships. I assumed that the continuous parameter `#o5` for the `above` predicate, could be instantiated with the discrete configurations `v13` or `v15` for the rovers. However, the plan hinged on the ability to actually *execute* the identified actions.
           
           The key realization came when I explicitly checked against the constraint: "You are only allowed to use the provided actions. It's essential to stick to the format of these basic actions." The given "list of valid action instances" was extremely restricted: just identity moves and drop_rock. It became clear that the goal, which required `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`, was fundamentally unachievable. The actions required for imaging and analysis were *not* included in the permitted actions. Therefore, there's no way to reach the desired state from the initial state, given these specific constraints, making the plan impossible.
