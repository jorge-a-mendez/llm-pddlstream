(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object 4 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to come up with 50 stable placements for object ID 4 on surface 0, which is a square area. Given the object's dimensions and the surface's bounding box, it's pretty straightforward. Since the object is square, rotating it doesn't change its AABB, which simplifies things in terms of stability.  My strategy will be to focus on finding a suitable range for the (x, y) coordinates of the object's center and then generate points within that range.  
           
           First, I need to calculate the valid region.  I start by determining the "safety margin" around the surface edges.  This is half the object's width, which is the same as half the object's height since it's square. I calculate the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates where the object's *center* can be while still being completely inside the surface. This is done by offsetting the surface's bounds by half the object's dimensions.
           
           The valid range for the x-coordinate of the object's center is calculated.  Similarly, I calculated the valid range for the y-coordinate. With these ranges, I've got the playing field.  To come up with 50 placements, I'll create a grid of points within the valid ranges. A simple grid makes it easy to ensure decent coverage.  I decided to generate a 5x10 grid, so I create 5 equally spaced x values and 10 equally spaced y values, ranging from the minimum valid position to the maximum, for each axis. Then, I iterate through all combinations of these x and y values.
           
           Even though theta (the object's rotation) doesn't affect stability in this case, I will add variety by cycling through different rotation values for each placement. I'll use 8 different theta values (0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi, 5pi/4, 3pi/2, and 7pi/4).
           
           Finally, I generate the 50 placements by iterating through these x and y coordinates in a grid pattern. Each combination gets a unique (x, y) coordinate, within the ranges I calculated, and I assigned a theta using the defined list. Since there are 50 placements and 8 different theta values, the theta values cycle. Since this is the first request for the object, no information from prior collisions is available, therefore this has no effect on the strategy.  And that's it!  50 stable, and diverse, placements ready to go.

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's get to work on placing this new object, ID 5, while avoiding that previous object, ID 4.** Based on the feedback, I need to ensure object ID 5 doesn't collide with where object ID 4 was successfully placed. I have the dimensions of object 5 and the surface (Surface 0) and the previous placement of object 4. First, I compute the half-dimensions of object 5 because it simplifies the collision checks, and establish that its nearly square. I then have to calculate the valid range for the center of object 5 on surface 0, taking into account the surface boundaries.
           
           I've got the bounding box and center of object 4 from its successful placement, so that is another important point that needs to be considered. Then, the collision constraints are then reevaluated: Object 5's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) can't overlap with object 4's AABB. I calculate valid regions for object 5's center, (x,y), with respect to the bounds of surface 0, and the previous position of object 4. Object 5 can't be fully within the AABB of object 4. This means object 5 must be either to the right or above of object 4.
           
           I determine a forbidden region on surface 0 where the center of object 5 can't be placed. This creates a valid region. To achieve a diverse set of 50 stable placements, I will use a grid of points on the surface, and exclude any points that fall within the collision region defined by the bounding box of object 4. I create a grid with 5 steps for x and y. Then I need to use rotation of object 5, and I choose three angles (0, pi/4, pi/2).
           
           Now, using a python program, I iterate through these valid (x,y) positions and angles, and create an output of unique and non-colliding placements. This placement data will then be output for the robot.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placement of Object ID 6: A Focused Summary**
           
           My current task is to generate 50 stable placements for Object ID 6 on a 2D surface, ensuring it avoids collisions with two pre-existing objects (ID 4 and ID 5) while respecting the surface boundaries. Object ID 6 is a square with side length 0.09324. Surface 0 is a 2D rectangle defined by the coordinates `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           I've established the necessary geometric calculations: the half-extents of Object ID 6 are 0.04662. This has allowed me to compute the valid region where Object ID 6's center can reside without violating surface containment.  For full containment, the center must be within `x: [-0.088, 0.088]` and `y: [-0.088, 0.088]`.
           
           I've calculated and visualized the AABBs for existing Objects ID 4 and ID 5, and their positions, which gives me an exclusion zone to avoid. Object ID 4 is in the bottom-left of the surface and has dimensions `(-0.135, -0.053) x (-0.135, -0.053)`. Object ID 5 lies to the left and has dimensions `(-0.135, -0.057) x (-0.039, 0.039)`.
           
           **Methodology:**
           To find stable positions efficiently, I'm constructing a 5x5 grid of potential (x, y) placements within the valid surface range.  Since Object ID 6 is square, I can significantly simplify collision detection: I only need to check the AABBs for overlap, and rotation does not affect the AABB dimensions.
           
           1.  **Grid Generation:** Create a grid of x and y coordinates that span the valid surface region.
           2.  **Collision Check:** For each grid point `(x, y)`, calculate Object ID 6's AABB. Then, compare its AABB against Object ID 4's AABB and Object ID 5's AABB.
           3.  **Validity Determination:** A placement is valid if the Object ID 6 AABB does *not* overlap with either obstacle AABB.
           4.  **Rotation:** Once a valid (x,y) location is obtained, create additional unique placements by applying multiple diverse rotations.
           
           I've carefully inspected the valid positions. Some grid positions will have collisions with the existing objects, so I've calculated that approximately 20 (x, y) coordinates can be placed within the valid space. A few valid (x,y) positions are `(0, 0)`, `(0.044, 0)`, `(0, 0.044)`, and `(0.044, 0.044)`. From each valid (x, y) placement, I can generate multiple valid, independent, stable placements based on the varied rotations of Object ID 6.
           
           I will iterate through the grid, check each point, and keep a list of the unique, stable (x, y) placements. I then combine those positions with the rotation angles to generate 50 unique placements for Object ID 6. The process is deterministic, so the list of placed objects will be repeatable.
