           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Immovable Object: An Analysis of Unreachable Goals**
           
           My analysis begins with the straightforward goal of placing four objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) onto a single surface (v18), effectively achieving the `on(object, v18)` predicate for each. The foundation of this plan rests on the axiom `on(o, r)` which is fulfilled when an object is `supported` by a pose on the surface and that the object is at that pose (`atpose`). I immediately decompose this goal into four subgoals, each focused on a single object.
           
           My initial investigation into the initial state reveals the current `on` relationships: all four target objects are already `on` a different surface (v11). The only available actions capable of changing this state are `pick` and `place`, which directly modify the `on` predicate. I confirm that the `place` action aligns with the required objective: placing an object at a pose where it is `supported` by the target surface (v18).
           
           My plan now hinges on identifying a feasible sequence of `pick` and `place` actions. Examining the initial state, I identify a shared 'target pose' (#o2) on v18 that the objects will be supported by. This suggests all objects could be moved to this target pose.
           
           I then focus on the `pick` and `place` actions, which use the `kin` facts, which detail the robot's arm configuration and grasp parameters. I realize that the action requires the arm to have a handempty state, that the object must be currently `atpose` where it is, and importantly, `atbconf` of the bconf, which is the base configuration, to be in position.
           
           The problem lies here. The initial state provides `atbconf(v3)`, but the necessary `kin` facts for executing actions (for `v8`, `v12`, `v14` and `v16`) consistently specify `#o3` as the required base configuration. The provided `move_base` action, unfortunately, does nothing and can't change the base configuration to #o3. Since the robot requires `#o3` to pick and place, and this cannot be achieved, the goal is unreachable given the current information. There are no relevant actions that can change the robot's base configuration.
