User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):

           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is largely defined by a central open area, with outer walls from -2.55 to 2.55 in both x and y. There's a vertical wall along x=0. Other obstacles are scattered within the larger area, including a large one in the bottom left, and smaller ones clustered in the top and bottom regions, and some isolated smaller obstacles. The target point is (0.8, -0.7). I will try to place the robot in a circle of radius 2 around the target point. I need to avoid the large vertical wall at x=0, and other small obstacles, especially those near the target. I will try to place the points in a way that minimizes the chance of occlusion by fixed obstacles. I will prioritize points that are not too close to the obstacles, and are on different sides of the target. I will check for the collisions within the provided AABBs.
           
           Obstacle AABBs:
           0: ((-2.5, -2.5), (2.5, 2.5)) - This is the overall boundary.
           1: ((-2.55, 2.45), (2.55, 2.55)) - Top wall.
           2: ((-2.55, -2.55), (2.55, -2.45)) - Bottom wall.
           3: ((2.45, -2.55), (2.55, 2.55)) - Right wall.

           The target point is (0.8, -0.7).
           The central wall is at x=0, so the target is to the right of it.
           Obstacles 12, 15, 17 are fairly close to the target on the right. Obstacle 16 is also relatively close.
           
           I will try to place positions to the right of the central wall (x>0), and avoid the small obstacles.
           
           Positions:
           (1.8 -0.7)
           (0.8 1.3)
           (0.8 -2.0)
           

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: (-0.570412814617157, 2.189479351043701, 0.20100000500679016), Proposed position: (1.8, -0.7) -- no line of sight to target
           ```
           
           The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point has changed to (-0.570412814617157, 2.189479351043701). The previous request's proposed position (1.8, -0.7) failed because there was no line of sight to the target. This makes sense as the new target is in the top-left quadrant, and the proposed position was in the bottom-right. The central wall at x=0.05 is a major obstacle. The previous position was on the right side of the wall, and the current target is on the left side, confirming that the central wall causes line-of-sight issues.
           
           Now, the target is at (-0.57, 2.19). This is in the top-left quadrant, to the left of the central wall (x=0). It's also quite close to the top wall (y=2.45).
           
           Let's look at the obstacles near the new target:
           Obstacle 1: ((-2.55, 2.45), (2.55, 2.55)) - Top wall. The target is very close to this.
           Obstacle 4: ((-2.55, -2.55), (-2.45, 2.55)) - Left wall.
           Obstacle 5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)) - Central vertical wall. This is a critical obstacle, as the target is to its left.
           Obstacle 19: ((-0.6079491784717449, 2.151942987189113), (-0.5328764507625691, 2.227015714898289)) - This is very close to the target! The target is at x=-0.57, y=2.19, and this obstacle spans x from -0.6 to -0.53 and y from 2.15 to 2.22. This means the target is *inside* or very close to the edge of obstacle 19. I need to be careful with this one.
           Obstacle 20: ((-1.9994035358387308, 1.8602712755244895), (-1.9203469162028952, 1.939327895160325)) - Another small obstacle, further to the left and slightly below the target.
           Obstacle 8: ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)) - Another obstacle further to the left and below.
           Obstacle 10: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)) - This one is also very close to the target, directly below it.
           
           Given the target is very close to and possibly inside obstacle 19, I need to place the robot very carefully. It implies that the line of sight must pass *through* this obstacle if the robot is placed directly in line with it. I should try to place the robot on different sides of obstacle 19, and obstacle 10. The max range is 2.
           
           Possible locations to consider:
           1. Directly below the target, but far enough to avoid obstacle 10 and 19.
           2. To the left of the target, avoiding obstacle 8, 20 and 19.
           3. To the right of the target, avoiding obstacle 5 (the central wall) and obstacle 19 and 10. This will be difficult due to the central wall.
           
           Let's try to place the robot below the target, around y = 0.5 to 1.5, and x near the target x.
           For example: x = -0.57, y = 1.0 (distance approx 1.19).
           Let's try to place the robot to the left of the target: x = -1.5, y = 2.19 (distance approx 0.93).
           Let's try to place the robot to the left and below: x = -1.5, y = 1.5 (distance approx sqrt(0.93^2 + 0.69^2) approx 1.16).
           
           Let's calculate precise positions avoiding the obstacles and within the max_range=2.
           Target: (-0.57, 2.19)
           Obstacle 19: ((-0.607, 2.151), (-0.532, 2.227)) - target is within this obstacle.
           Obstacle 10: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)) - target is above this obstacle.
           
           Since the target is within obstacle 19, any position will collide with obstacle 19. I assume the target is visible through whatever is considered "obstacle 19". If not, then this is impossible. Given the problem setup, this indicates that the "obstacle" in this context is just a region, and the robot might be able to see through or over it, or it is a very small part of the target itself. I will proceed as if the obstacle region doesn't prevent sight *if the base is not colliding with it*. The crucial point is that the robot base cannot *be inside* any obstacle.
           
           So, I need to choose a position (x, y) such that it is not within any of the AABBs.
           My target point is inside obstacle 19: x from -0.607 to -0.532, y from 2.151 to 2.227. My target is (-0.57, 2.19).
           The robot base cannot be in this region.
           The max range is 2.
           
           Let's try to place the robot base below the target, to avoid obstacle 19.
           If I put x = -0.57, y = 1.0. This is not in any obstacle. Distance is sqrt(0^2 + (2.19-1.0)^2) = 1.19. This is within max_range.
           Let's try to place the robot base to the left of the target, avoiding obstacle 19.
           If I put x = -1.0, y = 2.19. This is not in obstacle 19. Distance is sqrt((-0.57 - (-1.0))^2 + 0^2) = sqrt(0.43^2) = 0.43. This is within max_range.
           Let's try to place the robot base to the right of the target. This will be tricky because of the central wall at x=0.05.
           If I put x = -0.2, y = 2.19. This is not in obstacle 19. Distance is sqrt((-0.57 - (-0.2))^2 + 0^2) = sqrt(-0.37^2) = 0.37. This is within max_range. This is also to the left of x=0. It will avoid the central wall.
           
           Positions:
           (-0.57 1.0)
           (-1.0 2.19)
           (-0.2 2.19)

           The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point has changed again to (0.30324360728263855, 2.029843330383301). Let's call it (0.3, 2.03) for simplicity.
           This new target is in the top-right quadrant, to the right of the central wall (x=0).
           
           The previous positions failed for the previous target.
           Specifically, for the *new* target (0.3, 2.03):
           - (-0.57, 1.0) was "not reachable for robot base". This likely implies it was too far from the *new* target, or maybe out of bounds in some other way. The distance from (0.3, 2.03) to (-0.57, 1.0) is sqrt((0.3 - (-0.57))^2 + (2.03 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.87^2 + 1.03^2) = sqrt(0.7569 + 1.0609) = sqrt(1.8178) approx 1.348, which is within the max_range of 2. So "not reachable" probably implies a collision or line-of-sight issue for the *new* target point.
           - (-1.0, 2.19) was also "not reachable for robot base". Distance from (0.3, 2.03) to (-1.0, 2.19) is sqrt((0.3 - (-1.0))^2 + (2.03 - 2.19)^2) = sqrt(1.3^2 + (-0.16)^2) = sqrt(1.69 + 0.0256) = sqrt(1.7156) approx 1.309. Again, within range. This position is to the left of the central wall, while the target is to the right, so line-of-sight issues through the central wall (obstacle 5) are very likely for this point.
           - (-0.2, 2.19) "collides with: obstacle 0: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)) and obstacle 1: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))".
               - Collision with obstacle 0: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)). My proposed position (-0.2, 2.19) is not within the x-range of obstacle 0, which is [-0.05, 0.05]. It is to the left of the central wall. This seems like a typo in the feedback, perhaps it meant obstacle 5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)) (the central wall), which it would not collide with.
               - Collision with obstacle 1: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)). My proposed position (-0.2, 2.19) *is* within this obstacle, as -0.75 < -0.2 < -0.25 is false (because -0.2 is not less than -0.25) and 1.75 < 2.19 < 2.25 is true. It means my calculation of avoidance was wrong. I thought -0.2 was to the right of -0.25. My apologies. Let me re-evaluate this. The position x=-0.2 is indeed to the right of x=-0.25, meaning it *is* within the x-range of obstacle 1. So this collision is correct.
           
           Now for the new target: (0.3, 2.03).
           This target is in the top-right.
           Relevant obstacles:
           1: ((-2.55, 2.45), (2.55, 2.55)) - Top wall. Target is close.
           3: ((2.45, -2.55), (2.55, 2.55)) - Right wall.
           5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)) - Central vertical wall. The target is to the right of this wall (x=0.3 > 0.05). Any position to the left of x=0.05 will likely have line-of-sight issues.
           9: ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)) - This obstacle is very close to the target! Target (0.3, 2.03) is within the x-range (0.25, 0.75) and y-range (1.75, 2.25). So the target is *inside* obstacle 9.
           21: ((0.267, 1.993), (0.339, 2.065)) - This obstacle is also very close to the target. Target (0.3, 2.03) is within the x-range (0.267, 0.339) and y-range (1.993, 2.065). So the target is *inside* obstacle 21.
           
           This means the target is inside two overlapping obstacles (9 and 21). As before, I must assume the robot base cannot be in these obstacles, but the target is viewable.
           
           I need to find positions (x,y) within distance 2 from (0.3, 2.03) such that they don't collide with any fixed obstacles, especially 9 and 21, and are to the right of the central wall (x > 0.05).
           
           Let's try to place the robot:
           1. Below the target (lower y, similar x).
           2. To the right of the target (higher x, similar y).
           3. Slightly below and to the right, or below and to the left (but still to the right of x=0.05).
           
           Consider a point directly below the target. Target y=2.03. I need to clear obstacle 9 (y max 2.25) and obstacle 21 (y max 2.065).
           Let's try x=0.3, y=1.0. Distance = sqrt((0.3-0.3)^2 + (2.03-1.0)^2) = 1.03. This is well within range.
           This position (0.3, 1.0) is not within obstacle 9: y=1.0 is outside (1.75, 2.25).
           This position (0.3, 1.0) is not within obstacle 21: y=1.0 is outside (1.993, 2.065).
           This position (0.3, 1.0) is not within obstacle 5 (central wall): x=0.3 is outside (-0.05, 0.05).
           This looks like a good candidate.
           
           Consider a point to the right of the target. Target x=0.3. I need to clear obstacle 9 (x max 0.75) and obstacle 21 (x max 0.339).
           Let's try x=1.0, y=2.03. Distance = sqrt((0.3-1.0)^2 + (2.03-2.03)^2) = sqrt((-0.7)^2) = 0.7. Well within range.
           This position (1.0, 2.03) is not within obstacle 9: x=1.0 is outside (0.25, 0.75).
           This position (1.0, 2.03) is not within obstacle 21: x=1.0 is outside (0.267, 0.339).
           This position (1.0, 2.03) is not within obstacle 5 (central wall): x=1.0 is outside (-0.05, 0.05).
           This also looks like a good candidate.
           
           Consider a third point. Let's try slightly below and slightly to the right of the target, but further away from the other positions.
           Maybe x=1.5, y=1.5. Distance = sqrt((0.3-1.5)^2 + (2.03-1.5)^2) = sqrt((-1.2)^2 + 0.53^2) = sqrt(1.44 + 0.2809) = sqrt(1.7209) approx 1.31. Within range.
           This position (1.5, 1.5) is not within obstacle 9: x=1.5 is outside (0.25, 0.75).
           This position (1.5, 1.5) is not within obstacle 21: x=1.5 is outside (0.267, 0.339).
           This position (1.5, 1.5) is not within obstacle 5 (central wall): x=1.5 is outside (-0.05, 0.05).
           This looks like a good candidate.
           
           Positions:
           (0.3 1.0)
           (1.0 2.03)
           (1.5 1.5)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point has changed yet again to (-1.959875226020813, 1.8997995853424072). Let's call it (-1.96, 1.90) for simplicity.
           This new target is in the top-left quadrant, to the left of the central wall (x=0).
           
           All the previous positions failed for the previous target.
           Specifically, for the *new* target (-1.96, 1.90):
           - (0.3, 1.0) was "no line of sight to target". This is expected as (0.3, 1.0) is to the right of the central wall (x=0.05), and the target is to the left (-1.96). The central wall (obstacle 5) would block line of sight.
           - (1.0, 2.03) was "no line of sight to target". Same reason as above, it's to the right of the central wall.
           - (1.5, 1.5) was "no line of sight to target". Same reason as above, it's to the right of the central wall.
           
           Now for the new target: (-1.96, 1.90).
           This target is in the top-left quadrant, to the left of the central wall.
           Relevant obstacles near the target:
           1: ((-2.55, 2.45), (2.55, 2.55)) - Top wall. Target is fairly close.
           4: ((-2.55, -2.55), (-2.45, 2.55)) - Left wall. Target is fairly close.
           5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)) - Central vertical wall. Target is to the left of this wall. Any position to the right of x=0.05 will likely have line-of-sight issues.
           8: ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)) - This obstacle is *very close* to the target! Target x=-1.96, y=1.90. Obstacle 8 has x from -2.25 to -1.75 and y from 1.75 to 2.25. The target is *inside* obstacle 8.
           20: ((-1.999, 1.860), (-1.920, 1.939)) - This obstacle is also *very close* to the target. Target x=-1.96, y=1.90. Obstacle 20 has x from -1.999 to -1.920 and y from 1.860 to 1.939. The target is *inside* obstacle 20.
           
           So the target is inside two overlapping obstacles (8 and 20). As before, I must assume the robot base cannot be in these obstacles, but the target is viewable.
           
           I need to find positions (x,y) within distance 2 from (-1.96, 1.90) such that they don't collide with any fixed obstacles, especially 8 and 20, and are to the left of the central wall (x < -0.05).
           
           Let's try to place the robot:
           1. Below the target (lower y, similar x).
           2. To the left of the target (lower x, similar y).
           3. Slightly below and to the left, or below and to the right (but still to the left of x=-0.05).
           
           Consider a point directly below the target. Target y=1.90. I need to clear obstacle 8 (y min 1.75) and obstacle 20 (y min 1.860).
           Let's try x=-1.96, y=1.0. Distance = sqrt(( -1.96 - (-1.96))^2 + (1.90 - 1.0)^2) = 0.9. This is well within range.
           This position (-1.96, 1.0) is not within obstacle 8: y=1.0 is outside (1.75, 2.25).
           This position (-1.96, 1.0) is not within obstacle 20: y=1.0 is outside (1.860, 1.939).
           This position (-1.96, 1.0) is not within obstacle 5 (central wall): x=-1.96 is outside (-0.05, 0.05).
           This looks like a good candidate.
           
           Consider a point to the left of the target. Target x=-1.96. I need to clear obstacle 8 (x min -2.25) and obstacle 20 (x min -1.999).
           Let's try x=-2.3, y=1.90. Distance = sqrt((-1.96 - (-2.3))^2 + (1.90 - 1.90)^2) = sqrt(0.34^2) = 0.34. Well within range.
           This position (-2.3, 1.90) is not within obstacle 8: x=-2.3 is to the left of -2.25 (outside).
           This position (-2.3, 1.90) is not within obstacle 20: x=-2.3 is outside (-1.999, -1.920).
           This position (-2.3, 1.90) is not within obstacle 5 (central wall): x=-2.3 is outside (-0.05, 0.05).
           This looks like a good candidate.
           
           Consider a third point. Slightly below and to the right of the target (but still left of central wall).
           Let's try x=-1.0, y=1.5. Distance = sqrt((-1.96 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.90 - 1.5)^2) = sqrt((-0.96)^2 + 0.4^2) = sqrt(0.9216 + 0.16) = sqrt(1.0816) approx 1.04. Within range.
           This position (-1.0, 1.5) is not within obstacle 8: x=-1.0 is outside (-2.25, -1.75).
           This position (-1.0, 1.5) is not within obstacle 20: x=-1.0 is outside (-1.999, -1.920).
           This position (-1.0, 1.5) is not within obstacle 5 (central wall): x=-1.0 is outside (-0.05, 0.05).
           This looks like a good candidate.
           
           Positions:
           (-1.96 1.0)
           (-2.3 1.90)
           (-1.0 1.5)
