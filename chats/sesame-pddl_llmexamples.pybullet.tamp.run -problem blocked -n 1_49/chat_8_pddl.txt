           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.
           
           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q4', '#t9'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g2', '#q4', '#t8'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q4', '#q5', '#t11'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', '#p2', '#g2', '#q5', '#t10'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-traj-pose:('#t8', 'v15', 'v16')->()`, which impeded executing the action pick('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g2', '#q4', '#t8').
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v15`. Each of these objects has an initial pose (`v9`, `v13`, `v16` respectively). There are also abstract poses `#o2` that these objects can be moved to, as well as an abstract grasp `#o1`. The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, but only `v4` is controllable and can perform actions. The initial base configuration is `v3` and an abstract base configuration `#o3` is available. The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if object `v8`, `v12` or `v15` is on `v18` and `v17` is the type of that object.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` is defined as `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.
           From the initial state, we have `type(v8, v17)`.
           We also have `stackable(v8, v18)`.
           So, if we can place `v8` on `v18`, the goal will be achieved.
           Currently, `v8` is at `v9` and supported by `v11`.
           
           The available actions allow picking `v8` from `v9` and placing it at `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           Let's break down the plan:
           1. Move the base to a configuration that allows picking `v8`. The provided `kin` fact `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)` indicates that `v4` can grasp `v8` at `v9` from base configuration `#o3` using grasp `#o1` with arm trajectory `#o4`. So the robot needs to move its base to `#o3`.
           2. Pick `v8` from its current pose `v9` using arm `v4`, grasp `#o1`, and base configuration `#o3`.
           3. Move the base to a configuration that allows placing `v8` on `v18` at pose `#o2`. The `kin` fact `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` indicates that `v4` can place `v8` at `#o2` from base configuration `#o3` with grasp `#o1` and arm trajectory `#o4`. So, we can stay at `#o3`.
           4. Place `v8` onto `v18` at pose `#o2`.
           
           Let's check the preconditions for each step:
           
           `move_base(v3, #o3, #o0)`:
           - `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)`: True (provided in initial state).
           - `atbconf(v3)`: True (provided in initial state).
           - `canmove()`: True (provided in initial state).
           - This action is available in the action instances.
           
           After `move_base(v3, #o3, #o0)`:
           - `atbconf(#o3)` is true.
           - `atbconf(v3)` is false.
           - `canmove()` is false.
           
           `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`:
           - `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`: True (provided in initial state).
           - `atpose(v8, v9)`: True (provided in initial state).
           - `handempty(v4)`: True (provided in initial state).
           - `atbconf(#o3)`: True (achieved by `move_base`).
           - `unsafeapproach(v8, v9, #o1)`: False (no atom for `~test-cfree-approach-pose-negative` and `atpose` with other objects).
           - `unsafeatraj(#o4)`: False (no atom for `~test-cfree-traj-pose-negative` and `atpose` with other objects).
           - `new-axiom@0(v8)`: False (this axiom is `NegatedAtom =(?culprit, ?o)` `Atom graspable(?culprit)`, and since `v8` is `?o`, it would require a culprit other than `v8` to be graspable, which is not relevant here for the negative atom). The axiom new-axiom@0(?o) for picking is `NegatedAtom =(?culprit, ?o) Atom graspable(?culprit)`. If `?o` is `v8`, then it implies there must not exist any other graspable object. But in the current PDDL definition, `new-axiom@0(?o)` means that `v8` is not the only graspable object. So `new-axiom@0(v8)` means there is some other graspable object besides `v8`. The precondition is `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)`. This means there should be NO other graspable object besides `v8`. This is not true because `v12` and `v15` are also graspable.
           Let's re-examine `new-axiom@0(?o)`.
           Axiom `new-axiom@0(?o)` is `Conjunction NegatedAtom =(?culprit, ?o) Atom graspable(?culprit)`.
           The precondition `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)` means that `NOT (EXISTS ?culprit (NOT (?culprit = ?o)) AND graspable(?culprit))`.
           This simplifies to `FORALL ?culprit ( (?culprit = ?o) OR NOT graspable(?culprit) )`.
           In other words, there are no graspable objects other than `?o`.
           This is a problem because the initial state has `graspable(v12)` and `graspable(v15)`. So, `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(v8)` is false, and the `pick` action cannot be executed.
           
           Let me re-check the definition of the axiom `new-axiom@0(?o)`.
           Axiom new-axiom@0(?o)
             Conjunction
               NegatedAtom =(?culprit, ?o)
               Atom graspable(?culprit)
           
           This axiom is derived from the predicates. It means that there exists another graspable object `?culprit` which is not `?o`.
           The precondition for `pick` action is `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)`.
           This means it must be false that there exists another graspable object `?culprit` which is not `?o`.
           In other words, `?o` must be the ONLY graspable object.
           However, in the initial state, we have `graspable(v8)`, `graspable(v12)`, and `graspable(v15)`.
           So, if `?o` is `v8`, then `v12` and `v15` are `?culprit`s that satisfy `NegatedAtom =(?culprit, v8)` and `graspable(?culprit)`. Therefore, `new-axiom@0(v8)` is TRUE.
           Since `new-axiom@0(v8)` is TRUE, `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(v8)` is FALSE.
           This means the `pick` action cannot be executed with `v8`, `v12`, or `v15` as `?o`.
           
           The problem appears to be in the `new-axiom@0(?o)` which makes it impossible to pick any object as long as there are multiple graspable objects in the scene. This seems like a common problem and there might be a misunderstanding of the PDDL syntax or the intent of this axiom. Assuming the intent of `new-axiom@0(?o)` in the pick action is to prevent picking certain objects (perhaps those that are not the *target* object, or to represent some other constraint), its current definition makes picking any object impossible when there are multiple graspable objects.
           
           Let's re-examine the goal `Atom new-axiom@0()` (without parameters).
           Axiom new-axiom@0()
             Conjunction
               Atom on(?green, v18)
               Atom type(?green, v17)
           
           This is a different axiom. The `new-axiom@0()` (without parameters) is the goal, and it requires some object `?green` to be on `v18` and be of type `v17`.
           We know `type(v8, v17)`, `type(v12, v17)`.
           We also know `stackable(v8, v18)` and `stackable(v12, v18)`.
           So, if we can place either `v8` or `v12` on `v18`, the goal will be achieved.
           
           However, the `pick` action still has the problematic `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)` precondition.
           Given the current PDDL definition of `new-axiom@0(?o)` and the initial state, it's impossible to pick any object, and therefore, impossible to achieve the goal of placing an object on `v18`.
           
           If the problem description implies that only the actions provided in the "list of valid action instances" are allowed, then the continuous parameters have already been calculated and if `pick` actions are in the list, they implicitly satisfy the cfree preconditions. However, the explanation for the failed plan suggests that `test-cfree-traj-pose` check can still fail. This is confusing.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the pick precondition `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)`.
           If `new-axiom@0(?o)` is true, then `pick` cannot happen.
           `new-axiom@0(?o)` is true if `exists ?culprit such that ?culprit != ?o and graspable(?culprit)`.
           In our case, `graspable(v8)`, `graspable(v12)`, `graspable(v15)`.
           If we try to pick `v8`: `new-axiom@0(v8)` is true because `v12 != v8` and `graspable(v12)`.
           If we try to pick `v12`: `new-axiom@0(v12)` is true because `v8 != v12` and `graspable(v8)`.
           If we try to pick `v15`: `new-axiom@0(v15)` is true because `v8 != v15` and `graspable(v8)`.
           
           Therefore, the `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)` precondition for *any* pick action is false in this initial state. This implies that no `pick` action can ever be executed. Since picking is required to place an object on `v18`, the goal is unreachable.
           
           I must conclude that the goal is unreachable under the current interpretation of the PDDL domain and initial state.
           
           Final check on axioms:
           Axiom `new-axiom@0(?o)` (with parameter):
             Conjunction
               NegatedAtom =(?culprit, ?o)
               Atom graspable(?culprit)
           This is true if there exists a graspable object other than `?o`.
           The `pick` precondition is `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)`.
           This means there should *not* exist a graspable object other than `?o`.
           In other words, `?o` must be the *only* graspable object in the scene.
           Given `graspable(v8)`, `graspable(v12)`, `graspable(v15)` in the initial state, this precondition can never be met for any of `v8`, `v12`, or `v15`.
           
           Therefore, no pick action can be performed. Since the goal requires moving an object, which implies picking it up first, the goal is unreachable.
