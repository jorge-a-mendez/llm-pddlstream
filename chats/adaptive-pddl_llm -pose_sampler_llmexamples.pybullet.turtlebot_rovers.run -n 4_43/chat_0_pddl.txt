User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with inner boundaries at approximately +/- 2.5 in both x and y. There is a central pillar along the y-axis at x=0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the room, including some near the edges and some in the interior. Given the target point {target_point}, I will try to find positions within a radius of 2 from it. I will prioritize positions that are not directly behind any known obstacles from the target's perspective and that are within the allowed x and y ranges. I will avoid the central pillar (x=0) and the obstacles around the perimeter.
           
           Positions:
           ( {target_point[0]} {target_point[1]} )
           ( {target_point[0]-1.0} {target_point[1]-1.0} )
           ( {target_point[0]+1.0} {target_point[1]-1.0} )
