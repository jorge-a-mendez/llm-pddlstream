           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis: A Dead End**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal `new-axiom@0()` that hinges on collecting images and analyses of rocks.  My initial thought was straightforward: break down the axiom, check what's already true in the initial state, and then plan to achieve the remaining preconditions.  Easy, right?  Wrong.
           
           The problem quickly became apparent when I started looking at the details.  The preconditions for sending and receiving images and analyses (the key actions) require the rovers to be at very specific *configurations*, represented by these continuous parameters like `#o0`, `#o3`, etc.  The initial state tells me that the rovers *can* be at those configurations, but crucially, they *aren't* currently there. They're stuck at `v13` and `v15`, and the only movement actions available allow for self-loops – they can only stay put!
           
           This is a fundamental constraint.  Even if I were to form the appropriate plans (calibrating the cameras, taking images, sampling rocks, and sending the data), the rovers simply *cannot* execute them because they cannot change their configurations to the required poses. The key is in the definition of those continuous parameters. They are not parameters to be searched for by the planner: they are fixed and *given*, and the rover cannot be at that configuration.
           
           The available actions are just a trap.  The `move` actions are useless, and all the "useful" actions depend on these unavailable configurations.  It's a classic case of an unsolvable problem due to a fundamental limitation in the allowed actions. The goal is unachievable given the constraints of the problem and I must conclude this. It's a nicely crafted puzzle, though!
