           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.046, -0.288), (0.144, -0.19)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.275, -0.359), (-0.178, -0.262)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.178, 0.347), (0.274, 0.442)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.267, 0.238), (-0.193, 0.311)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.095, -0.239, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.452, 0.892).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.226, -0.31, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.472, 0.881).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.226, 0.395, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.262, 0.965).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.23, 0.274, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, -0.028).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Path to Placement: A Robot's Journey**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is clear: get those four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) from their current perch on v11 and plant them on v18. It's like a mini-Tetris game, but with a robot arm.
           
           First, I need to understand the playing field. I've got the robot base (v3), its arm (v4), and everything's starting configuration. The initial state is the objects are sitting on v11, and my goal is for them to be "on" v18. The "on" axiom is the key, meaning I need each object's pose to satisfy the supported predicate relative to v18.
           
           Here's the plan I'm formulating:
           
           1.  **Get into Position:** The base has to move from its starting point (v3) to a "sweet spot" (#o3). This spot, according to the facts, is where the arm can easily reach the objects.
           2.  **Pick and Place Routine:** For each of the four objects:
               *   Reach out with the arm and grab it from its current pose.
               *   Then, precisely place that object on v18 at its target spot (#o2).
           
           The core of the plan involves picking and placing. The pick and place are handled by the `kin` facts, which provide all the necessary information. The plan utilizes the system's `unsafe...` axioms, and the problem states "is likely to be executable given the geometry of the scene".
           
           Now, let's translate this abstract plan into concrete actions. I've mapped out the poses, taking the object sizes and the size of v18 into account to get the final positions. I want the objects neatly organized and completely stable.
           
           *   I'll arrange v8, v12, v14, and v16 in a square-like formation on v18. Each will have a specific x and y coordinate, while maintaining the z-coordinate.
           
              After determining this placement on v18, I carefully defined each pose using the format (#o2 object surface), defining a location relative to surface v18. These will provide the input data.
           
           I'm checking all the constraints. The `kin` facts mean the base must be at #o3. I found that I need to move the base from the starting point at v3 to #o3. The problem statement says I'll define continuous object names starting with '#'.
           
           So, here's the final sequence:
           
           1.  Move the base from v3 to the position #o3.
           2.  Pick v8 from its initial location.
           3.  Place v8 at its target coordinates on v18.
           4.  Pick v12 from its starting position.
           5.  Place v12 at its coordinates on v18.
           6.  Pick v14 from its initial position.
           7.  Place v14 at its destination.
           8.  Pick v16.
           9.  Place v16.
           
           This approach should be efficient since it involves only one movement of the base and a pick/place process for each object. The estimated cost is low, as expected. I've got a precise strategy for this object manipulation task.
