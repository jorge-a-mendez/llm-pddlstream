User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene contains a large central obstacle, likely obstacle 0, which is a square from (-2.5, -2.5) to (2.5, 2.5). There are also outer boundary walls (obstacles 1-4) and a thin vertical wall through the center (obstacle 5). Additionally, there are several smaller rectangular obstacles scattered throughout the scene. My strategy is to select positions that are within the allowed range and are close to the target point, but attempt to avoid the known obstacles. I will prioritize positions that are likely to have a clear line of sight.
