           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable and stackable objects: `v15`, `v12`, and `v8`. They are currently at specific poses: `v15` at `v16`, `v12` at `v13`, and `v8` at `v9`. They are supported by `v11` and `v14` respectively, and also by `v10` and `v18` in various configurations. The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both of which are currently empty. The robot's base is at configuration `v3`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true. The object `v8` has `type(v8, v17)` and `stackable(v8, v18)`. The object `v12` has `type(v12, v17)` and `stackable(v12, v18)`. The object `v15` has no `type` or `stackable` information that aligns with `v17` and `v18`. Therefore, to achieve the goal, we need to place either `v8` or `v12` on `v18`.
           
           However, the only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not change the state of any objects (other than the base configuration, which remains `v3`), and does not allow for picking, placing, cleaning, or cooking. Therefore, it is impossible to achieve the goal of having `v8` or `v12` on `v18` with the given actions.
           
           The goal is unreachable with the given action instances.
