User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is enclosed by a square region defined by obstacles 0-4, ranging from approximately -2.5 to 2.5 in both x and y. There is a vertical wall (obstacle 5) at x=0, extending across the entire y-range. This divides the scene into two halves. There are several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the scene. It appears that the target point is at (0.0, 0.0). I need to find positions within a radius of 2 from this point. Given the wall at x=0, I should probably try to get positions on both sides of the wall, if possible.
           Positions:
           (1.0 0.0)
           (-1.0 0.0)
           (0.0 1.0)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point is now at (1.9376107454299927, 1.8146617412567139).
           From the previous attempt, I learned that (1.0, 0.0) and (-1.0, 0.0) do not have line-of-sight to the target, which is located in the upper-right quadrant. This makes sense given the vertical wall at x=0 (obstacle 5). Also, (0.0, 1.0) collides with obstacle 5, which is the wall at x=0. This means I need to be careful not to place the robot directly on the wall. Since the target is in the upper right quadrant, I should focus on positions in that general direction. I will try positions that are closer to the target point and more to the right, avoiding the x=0 wall. I will also make sure the positions are within 2 units of the target.
           Positions:
           (1.9 0.5)
           (0.5 1.9)
           (1.5 1.0)
