User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room defined by bounding box 0, with walls defined by bounding boxes 1-4. There's a vertical partition (bounding box 5) down the middle. There are several smaller obstacles scattered around, some in clusters (like 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) and some isolated (like 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20).
           Given the target point at (-1.33400511 0.44855239), and the max range of 4, I will try to place the robot in a variety of positions around the target, avoiding the known obstacles and the central partition. I will prioritize positions that offer a clear line of sight, such as those to the left or right of the target, and positions slightly further away to increase the chances of avoiding local occlusions. I will make sure the positions are within the overall room limits of x: [-2.5, 2.5] and y: [-2.5, 2.5].
