           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Goal and Action Applicability**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: `new-axiom@0()`. Breaking it down, it's a conjunction of several conditions.  Two of the primary ones are about getting images and analyses: `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`. The other conditions are already true in the initial state.
           
           To achieve these, I need to look at how these subgoals are accomplished through actions. For images, that's a series of steps: calibrate, take_image, and send_image.  For analyses, it's sample_rock, and then send_analysis.
           
           Now, here's where it gets interesting, and frankly, a bit limiting. I'm given a specific list of *valid* actions I'm allowed to use. These actions are limited to: `move` and `drop_rock`. 
           
           Here's the problem: none of these valid actions have an impact on any of the core sub-goals: taking or sending images, or obtaining and sending analyses. They can only manipulate the rover's location or the status of a store.
           
           Since I am restricted to the provided action instances, and these cannot achieve the preconditions needed to take and send images, or sample and send analyses, then the overall goal is not achievable. I can't construct a valid plan with the given tools. It's a no-go.
