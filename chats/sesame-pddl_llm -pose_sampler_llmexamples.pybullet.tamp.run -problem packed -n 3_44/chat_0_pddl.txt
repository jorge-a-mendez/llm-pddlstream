           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 4) -- 0.09631646928736382, 0.09631646928736382)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single square surface centered at the origin, with extents from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y directions. The object is a square with side length 0.09631646928736382. To place the object stably on the surface, its center must be within the surface's bounds, accounting for half of the object's dimensions.
           
           For a square object with side `s` on a square surface with bounds `(-L, -L)` to `(L, L)`, the object's center `(x, y)` must satisfy:
           `L - s/2 > x > -L + s/2`
           `L - s/2 > y > -L + s/2`
           
           In this case, `L = 0.135` and `s = 0.09631646928736382`.
           `s/2 = 0.04815823464368191`.
           So, the valid range for x and y is:
           `0.135 - 0.04815823464368191 > x > -0.135 + 0.04815823464368191`
           `0.08684176535631809 > x > -0.08684176535631809`
           The same applies to y.
           
           Since the object is a square, its orientation (rotation angle theta) does not affect its AABB. Therefore, any rotation will be equally stable as long as the center is within the valid range. I will generate a diverse set of placements by varying x, y, and theta. I will focus on the center of the surface, as well as positions near the edges but within the stable region.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still consists of a single square surface (0) with extents from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. A new object (ID: 5) is provided, which is also a square with side length 0.09243376220633714.
           
           I have learned that object 4 was successfully placed at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. This means object 4 is centered at `(0,0)` on surface 0.
           
           For object 5, its side `s_5 = 0.09243376220633714`.
           `s_5/2 = 0.04621688110316857`.
           The valid range for x and y for object 5 on surface 0 (without considering object 4) is:
           `0.135 - 0.04621688110316857 > x > -0.135 + 0.04621688110316857`
           `0.08878311889683143 > x > -0.08878311889683143`
           The same applies to y.
           
           Now I must avoid collision with object 4, which is a square centered at `(0,0)` with side `s_4 = 0.09631646928736382`.
           Its AABB extends from `(-s_4/2, -s_4/2)` to `(s_4/2, s_4/2)`.
           `s_4/2 = 0.04815823464368191`.
           So, object 4 occupies the region `(-0.04815823464368191, -0.04815823464368191)` to `(0.04815823464368191, 0.04815823464368191)`.
           
           To avoid collision, object 5's AABB must not overlap with object 4's AABB.
           This means that if object 5 is placed, its center `(x_5, y_5)` must be such that:
           `|x_5| > s_4/2 + s_5/2 = 0.04815823464368191 + 0.04621688110316857 = 0.09437511574685048` OR
           `|y_5| > s_4/2 + s_5/2 = 0.09437511574685048`
           
           However, the maximum x and y for object 5 are `0.08878311889683143`.
           Since `0.09437511574685048 > 0.08878311889683143`, it means that there is no space for object 5 on surface 0 if object 4 is at the center. This is because the sum of half-widths of the two objects is greater than the available width on the surface.
           
           Let me re-evaluate my reasoning. The problem statement says I'm given surfaces and an object, and I must find a stable placement. If a previous placement collided with a *non-fixed obstacle*, I must use that to learn about the geometry. The previous placement was a *success*, meaning it did *not* collide with a fixed obstacle. The ID 4 object is now present in the scene as a fixed obstacle.
           
           Okay, my previous calculation of valid ranges for object 5 was correct.
           Max `x` or `y` for object 5 is `0.08878311889683143`.
           Minimum `x` or `y` (absolute value) to avoid collision with object 4 is `0.09437511574685048`.
           Since `0.08878311889683143 < 0.09437511574685048`, it is impossible to place object 5 without colliding with object 4 if object 4 is at the center and considered fixed.
           
           This implies that my understanding of "non-fixed obstacle" might be wrong, or the problem has an edge case. If object 4 is truly a *fixed obstacle* now, then there is no stable placement for object 5.
           
           Let's assume the problem implies that I should find a stable placement *if one exists*, and that *my interpretation of "non-fixed obstacle" is incorrect and all previously placed objects are now fixed*. In this scenario, no placement for object 5 is possible on surface 0.
           
           However, the instructions state "You never give up. No matter how many times you fail... you will always try to find a new placement." This means I must provide 50 placements, even if they are likely to fail. I will provide placements that are as close as possible to being stable and avoiding collision, prioritizing being within the surface bounds, as that's a hard constraint. These placements will inevitably collide with object 4. I will try to place object 5 right at the edge of the allowed surface region, and also some positions within the central part to maximize diversity, knowing they will collide.
           
           I will attempt to place object 5 such that its AABB *barely touches* the AABB of object 4. For example, if object 5's x-coordinate is `s_4/2 + s_5/2`, it would theoretically avoid overlap, but this `x` value is beyond the surface bounds.
           So, the best I can do is place it as far as possible while staying on the surface.
           
           Maximum valid x for object 5: `x_max_5 = 0.08878311889683143`.
           Minimum valid x for object 5: `x_min_5 = -0.08878311889683143`.
           
           Any placement for object 5 will collide with object 4. I will pick placements at the extremes of the valid range for object 5 on the surface, and some inside, knowing they will collide. Since the object is a square, rotation doesn't change its AABB.

Model:     The scene still consists of a single square surface (0) with extents from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. A new object (ID: 6) is provided, which is also a square with side length `s_6 = 0.07840346535133186`.
           
           I have learned about the successful placements of two previous objects, which are now considered fixed obstacles:
           - Object 4 (ID: 4) is at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. Its side `s_4 = 0.09631646928736382`. Its AABB is `(-0.048158, -0.048158)` to `(0.048158, 0.048158)`.
           - Object 5 (ID: 5) is at `(0, 0.0, 0.088, 0.0)`. Its side `s_5 = 0.09243376220633714`. Its AABB is `(0.088 - s_5/2, -s_5/2)` to `(0.088 + s_5/2, s_5/2)`.
             `s_5/2 = 0.04621688110316857`.
             So, object 5's AABB is `(0.088 - 0.04621688110316857, -0.04621688110316857)` to `(0.088 + 0.04621688110316857, 0.04621688110316857)`.
             This simplifies to `(0.041783, -0.046217)` to `(0.134217, 0.046217)`.
           
           Now, for object 6, its side `s_6 = 0.07840346535133186`.
           `s_6/2 = 0.03920173267566593`.
           
           The surface bounds are `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           The stable region for object 6 on the surface (without considering other objects) is:
           `0.135 - s_6/2 > x > -0.135 + s_6/2`
           `0.135 - 0.03920173267566593 > x > -0.135 + 0.03920173267566593`
           `0.09579826732433407 > x > -0.09579826732433407`
           Same for y.
           
           Object 4 occupies `x` range `(-0.048158, 0.048158)` and `y` range `(-0.048158, 0.048158)`.
           Object 5 occupies `x` range `(0.041783, 0.134217)` and `y` range `(-0.046217, 0.046217)`.
           
           Let's find the regions where object 6 can be placed.
           Overlap of x-ranges:
           Object 4: `[-0.048158, 0.048158]`
           Object 5: `[0.041783, 0.134217]`
           The right side of object 4 is at `0.048158`. The left side of object 5 is at `0.041783`.
           There is an overlap between object 4 and object 5 in the x-direction from `0.041783` to `0.048158`. This seems to imply that Object 5's actual placement as given (`0.088, 0.0`) would make it collide with object 4, given the side lengths.
           
           Let's recheck the collision condition for Object 5 relative to Object 4.
           Object 4 center: `(0,0)`, `s_4/2 = 0.048158`
           Object 5 center: `(0.088, 0.0)`, `s_5/2 = 0.046217`
           Distance between centers in x: `0.088`.
           Sum of half widths: `s_4/2 + s_5/2 = 0.048158 + 0.046217 = 0.094375`.
           Since `0.088 < 0.094375`, object 5 *does* collide with object 4. This is a crucial piece of information. This means the feedback I received that `(ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.088, 0.0` was a "success" means it *did not collide with fixed obstacles*. This implies that my interpretation that previously placed objects become "fixed obstacles" is incorrect. Or, more likely, it means I should consider the success as true and work with those coordinates, but understand that the definition of a fixed obstacle might exclude other placed objects.
           
           The prompt states: "If you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene."
           And then it says: "The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests."
           
           This suggests that the *only* fixed obstacles are those *initially present in the scene*, not the objects I've placed. If placed objects were fixed, a placement that collides would not be a success. Since ID 5's placement was a success, it must mean it didn't collide with any *initial* fixed obstacles (of which there are none explicitly stated, only surface bounds). This also means it didn't collide with object 4, which would imply that my collision detection logic for "successes" is different from the problem's (perhaps it treats a small overlap as non-collision, or objects can share borders). Or, it means the objects I place *do not become fixed obstacles for subsequent objects*, which would contradict the spirit of "learning about the geometry of the scene" for non-fixed obstacles.
           
           Given the explicit success message, I will assume that the placement for ID 4 and ID 5 are indeed valid and that the 'fixed obstacles' only refer to the initial environment. Therefore, I will try to place object 6 within the surface 0 bounds, ignoring collision with objects 4 and 5 for now. I will try to place it in the negative x region, to differentiate from object 5.
           
           If this interpretation is wrong, then all my previous placements for object 5 would have failed, and object 6 would also likely fail. But since I must always provide 50 placements, I will proceed with this interpretation for now.
           
           Valid range for x and y for object 6 is `(-0.095798, 0.095798)`.
           I'll focus on the negative x-side of the surface for object 6, and also some other regions to provide diversity.
