           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.
           
           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q6', '#t16'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g3', '#q6', '#t11'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q6', '#q3', '#t14'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', 'p4', '#g3', '#q3', '#t3'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q3', '#q1', '#t13'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v12', 'v13', '#g1', '#q1', '#t1'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q1', '#q5', '#t18'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v12', 'p5', '#g1', '#q5', '#t10'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q5', '#q2', '#t19'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v14', 'v15', '#g2', '#q2', '#t2'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q2', '#q4', '#t17'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v14', 'p6', '#g2', '#q4', '#t4'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q4', '#q7', '#t20'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v16', 'v17', '#g0', '#q7', '#t12'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q7', '#q0', '#t15'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v16', 'p7', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-approach-pose:('v16', 'p7', '#g0', 'v12', 'p5')->()`, which impeded executing the action pick('v4', 'v16', 'v17', '#g0', '#q7', '#t12').
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions. If the failure occurs after placing on any pose that does not start with '#', it may be due to using a combination of invalid poses.As the expert, you may decide to choose additional poses, providing their continuous values using any free pose starting with '#'. 

Model:     The goal is to move all four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) onto the surface v18.
           Currently:
           - v8 is at v9, supported by v11.
           - v12 is at v13, supported by v11.
           - v14 is at v15, supported by v11.
           - v16 is at v17, supported by v11.
           
           All target poses p4, p5, p6, p7 are on surface v18.
           The robot needs to pick each object from its initial pose and place it onto its respective target pose on v18. The robot arm is `v4` and the base configuration is `v3`. The `handempty(v4)` predicate is true initially.
           
           The previous plan failed because placing `v16` at `p7` was obstructed by `v12` at `p5`. This indicates a collision issue when placing objects too close on the same surface.
           The problem provides collision check functions like `unsafeapproach` and `unsafepose` which will prevent placing or picking if there are collisions. The goal asks to place all four objects on `v18`. We have four target poses p4, p5, p6, p7 that are defined as supported by v18.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the placement sequence and available poses. The previous plan tried to place v8 on p4, v12 on p5, v14 on p6, and v16 on p7. The failure occurred when picking v16 to place on p7, which was obstructed by v12 on p5. This suggests that p5 and p7 might be too close, or the order of placement causes issues.
           
           We need to ensure that when placing an object, its target pose is not unsafe (e.g., collision with other objects already placed). We also need to ensure the approach for placing is collision-free.
           
           Looking at the available poses and supported relationships:
           - `pose(v8, p4)` supported by `v18` and `v10`
           - `pose(v12, p5)` supported by `v18` and `v10`
           - `pose(v14, p6)` supported by `v18` and `v10`
           - `pose(v16, p7)` supported by `v18` and `v10`
           
           All objects need to be placed on v18. The initial poses (v9, v13, v15, v17) are supported by v11.
           The provided action instances include `pick` and `place` actions for each object using both its initial pose and the target poses on v18. For instance, `pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4` (picking v8 from its initial pose v9) and `place v4 v8 p4 #o1 #o3 #o4` (placing v8 at p4).
           
           Let's consider the geometry of the target surface v18 (AABB = ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))). This is a relatively small surface centered at (0,0).
           The target poses are:
           p4: (0.05, 0.05, 0.782)
           p5: (-0.05, 0.05, 0.782)
           p6: (0.05, -0.05, 0.782)
           p7: (-0.05, -0.05, 0.782)
           
           These poses are close to the corners of the v18 AABB.
           Object v12 (AABB: (-0.085, 0.015), (-0.015, 0.085)) and v16 (AABB: (-0.085, -0.085), (-0.015, -0.015)) are small objects.
           If v12 is at p5 (-0.05, 0.05) and v16 is at p7 (-0.05, -0.05), they are on the left side of the surface v18, one in the front-left corner and one in the back-left corner. It's possible that the collision occurred because the robot's arm movement to pick v16 (which is at v17 originally) to place it at p7 was obstructed by v12 already placed at p5.
           
           The key is to select a sequence that minimizes collisions. A common strategy is to place objects from "inside-out" or "back-to-front" or to spread them out if possible. Given the very tight packing on `v18` (all four objects at the four corners), the order is critical.
           
           Let's try a different order of placing:
           1. Place v8 at p4 (0.05, 0.05)
           2. Place v14 at p6 (0.05, -0.05)
           3. Place v12 at p5 (-0.05, 0.05)
           4. Place v16 at p7 (-0.05, -0.05)
           
           This sequence attempts to clear one side (right side first) and then move to the other side (left side). The previous plan put v12 at p5 (left-front) and then picked v16 (from v17) to place it at p7 (left-back). This might have caused the approach trajectory for v16 to collide with v12.
           
           Since there are no alternative poses on v18 (no `#o2` supported by `v18` for `v8, v12, v14, v16` that is not `p4, p5, p6, p7`), we must use p4, p5, p6, p7. The only continuous parameters we can provide are for `#o3` (bconf) and `#o1` (grasp). The `kin` predicates use `#o3` and `#o4` (trajectory), `basemotion` uses `#o0` (trajectory).
           
           Let's use the given valid actions.
           The robot is at `v3` initially. The arm `v4` is at `v5` and `handempty`.
           All `pick` actions require `kin(v4, <object>, <initial_pose>, #o1, #o3, #o4)`.
           All `place` actions require `kin(v4, <object>, <target_pose>, #o1, #o3, #o4)`.
           So, all `pick` and `place` actions will use the same `#o1` (grasp) and `#o3` (bconf for the robot arm `v4` to operate).
           The base movements are `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` and `move_base #o3 v3 #o0`. This means the robot moves from its current base configuration `v3` to a new base configuration `#o3` where the arm operations take place, and then returns to `v3` if needed. The `kin` predicates indicate `#o3` is the base configuration where the `pick`/`place` actions occur. So we'll move to `#o3` once, do all picks/places, and then move back to `v3` at the end (although the goal doesn't require returning to `v3`).
           
           Let's assume `#o3` is a base configuration that allows reaching all pick and place poses.
           The current `atbconf` is `v3`. We need to move to `#o3` before any pick/place.
           `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)` and `kin(v4, ..., #o1, #o3, #o4)` are consistent.
           
           Plan:
           1. Move to the pick/place base configuration `#o3`.
           2. Pick v8 from v9.
           3. Place v8 at p4.
           4. Pick v14 from v15.
           5. Place v14 at p6.
           6. Pick v12 from v13.
           7. Place v12 at p5.
           8. Pick v16 from v17.
           9. Place v16 at p7.
           
           The previous plan had issues with `test-cfree-approach-pose:('v16', 'p7', '#g0', 'v12', 'p5')->()`. This means that `v12` at `p5` was obstructing the approach trajectory to place `v16` at `p7`. The objects are small, and the poses are on the corners of `v18`.
           - p4: (0.05, 0.05) - top-right
           - p5: (-0.05, 0.05) - top-left
           - p6: (0.05, -0.05) - bottom-right
           - p7: (-0.05, -0.05) - bottom-left
           
           The previous plan's order was:
           - v8 at p4
           - v12 at p5
           - v14 at p6
           - v16 at p7 (failed)
           
           The failure was picking v16 to place at p7, with v12 already at p5.
           Let's analyze the new proposed order:
           1. Pick v8 from v9, place v8 at p4. (top-right)
           2. Pick v14 from v15, place v14 at p6. (bottom-right)
              At this point, the right side of v18 is occupied. The left side is free.
           3. Pick v12 from v13, place v12 at p5. (top-left)
              Now, p5 is occupied.
           4. Pick v16 from v17, place v16 at p7. (bottom-left)
              When placing v16 at p7, v12 at p5 is at the other corner of the same side. This might still cause issues.
           
           Perhaps the collision is not between the objects, but the robot's arm colliding with objects already placed.
           Let's consider the arm `v4` and base configuration `#o3`.
           The `kin` predicates link `v4`, object, pose, grasp, bconf, atraj.
           The key here is that the `kin` predicates only specify a single `#o3` base configuration for all actions. If this `#o3` is chosen optimally to reach all pick and place locations, then it should work.
           
           Let's try another order: place objects from the back to the front, or from left to right.
           Consider `v18` with origin at (0,0), extending from -0.135 to 0.135 in x and y.
           p4: (0.05, 0.05)
           p5: (-0.05, 0.05)
           p6: (0.05, -0.05)
           p7: (-0.05, -0.05)
           
           If the robot is in front of the table (positive y or negative y side), it might reach different corners better.
           The poses seem to be defined with Z-up, so positive X is typically to the right, positive Y is typically forward from the robot's perspective.
           Let's assume the robot is positioned such that it faces the table.
           
           Maybe placing the objects that are furthest from each other first helps.
           p7 (-0.05, -0.05) and p4 (0.05, 0.05) are diagonal.
           p5 (-0.05, 0.05) and p6 (0.05, -0.05) are diagonal.
           
           Let's try placing two diagonal objects first, then the other two.
           Order: v16 -> p7, v8 -> p4, v14 -> p6, v12 -> p5.
           This order puts v16 at bottom-left and v8 at top-right. Then v14 at bottom-right and v12 at top-left.
           This ensures that when placing v12 at p5, v16 is at p7 (bottom-left) and v8 is at p4 (top-right). v14 is at p6 (bottom-right). The top-left corner is relatively clear for placing v12.
           Similarly, for placing v16 at p7, p5 (top-left) will be clear.
           
           Let's try this sequence of placing actions:
           1. `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` (move to operating base config)
           2. `pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           3. `place v4 v16 p7 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           4. `pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           5. `place v4 v8 p4 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           6. `pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           7. `place v4 v14 p6 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           8. `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           9. `place v4 v12 p5 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           
           The previous plan failed at `pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 #o3 #o4` because `test-cfree-approach-pose:('v16', 'p7', '#g0', 'v12', 'p5')->()` failed.
           This meant that when attempting to *pick* `v16` from `v17`, the approach trajectory for `v16` collided with `v12` already placed at `p5`.
           But `v12` is not placed at `p5` yet when picking `v16` from `v17` in *this* proposed order. `v12` is still at `v13`.
           The previous plan's sequence was:
           1. pick v8 from v9
           2. place v8 at p4
           3. pick v12 from v13
           4. place v12 at p5
           5. pick v14 from v15
           6. place v14 at p6
           7. pick v16 from v17 (here it failed, collision with v12 at p5)
           
           My proposed new order:
           1. pick v16 from v17
           2. place v16 at p7
           3. pick v8 from v9
           4. place v8 at p4
           5. pick v14 from v15
           6. place v14 at p6
           7. pick v12 from v13
           8. place v12 at p5
           
           Let's re-verify the pre-conditions for the failed action from the previous attempt.
           `pick(v4, v16, v17, #g0, #q7, #t12)`
           Preconditions:
           - `kin(v4, v16, v17, #g0, #q7, #t12)` (given as `kin(v4, v16, v17, #o1, #o3, #o4)`)
           - `atpose(v16, v17)` (true initially)
           - `handempty(v4)` (true before this pick)
           - `atbconf(#q7)` (true, was `atbconf(#q2)` before moving to pick v14) - this means base config might have changed.
           - `NegatedAtom unsafeapproach(v16, v17, #g0)` - this implies no object at `p5` (v12) when picking v16 from v17.
           - `NegatedAtom unsafeatraj(#t12)`
           
           The previous plan had:
           `move_base (#q5, #q2, #t19)` (base config becomes `#q2`)
           `pick (v4, v14, v15, #g2, #q2, #t2)` (v14 is picked)
           `move_base (#q2, #q4, #t17)` (base config becomes `#q4`)
           `place (v4, v14, p6, #g2, #q4, #t4)` (v14 is placed at p6)
           `move_base (#q4, #q7, #t20)` (base config becomes `#q7`)
           `pick (v4, v16, v17, #g0, #q7, #t12)` (this is where it failed)
           
           The error message was `test-cfree-approach-pose:('v16', 'p7', '#g0', 'v12', 'p5')->()`. This means that when trying to `pick v16` (from its *initial* pose `v17`), the approach trajectory for `v16` collided with `v12` at `p5`.
           This implies that `v12` must have already been placed at `p5`.
           Let's check the previous plan again:
           1. `pick v4 v8 v9 #g3 #q6 #t11` (v8 picked)
           2. `place v4 v8 p4 #g3 #q3 #t3` (v8 at p4)
           3. `pick v4 v12 v13 #g1 #q1 #t1` (v12 picked)
           4. `place v4 v12 p5 #g1 #q5 #t10` (v12 at p5)
           ... then subsequent actions, and finally the failed pick for v16.
           So yes, `v12` was indeed placed at `p5` *before* the failed `pick` action for `v16`.
           
           The failure was not about placing `v16` at `p7` being obstructed by `v12` at `p5`. It was `pick(v4, v16, v17, ...)` being obstructed by `v12` at `p5`. This is very critical.
           The `kin` predicates for picking `v16` from `v17` are: `kin(v4, v16, v17, #o1, #o3, #o4)`.
           The `unsafeapproach` predicate is `unsafeapproach(?o: object, ?p: object, ?g: object)`.
           For pick action, it's `NegatedAtom unsafeapproach(?o, ?p, ?g)`. Here `?o` is `v16`, `?p` is `v17`, `?g` is `#o1`.
           So the failure means `unsafeapproach(v16, v17, #o1)` was true.
           And `unsafeapproach` axiom states:
           `unsafepose(?o: object, ?p: object, ?g: object)`
             `Conjunction`
               `Atom pose(?o, ?p)`
               `Atom grasp(?o, ?g)`
               `Atom pose(?o2, ?p2)`
               `NegatedAtom =(?o, ?o2)`
               `Atom ~test-cfree-approach-pose-negative(?o, ?p, ?g, ?o2, ?p2)`
               `Atom atpose(?o2, ?p2)`
           In our case: `?o` is `v16`, `?p` is `v17`, `?g` is `#o1`.
           `?o2` is `v12`, `?p2` is `p5`.
           This means that when the robot was attempting to `pick v16` from `v17`, `v12` was already at `p5`, and `v12` at `p5` collided with the `approach trajectory` for picking `v16` from `v17`.
           
           This is a very specific type of collision. The approach trajectory for picking an object from its *initial* location can be blocked by objects *already placed* at their *target* locations. This is subtle.
           
           To resolve this, we need to ensure that when we pick an object, no already placed objects obstruct its *initial pick approach*.
           This means we should try to place objects at their target locations such that they don't block the approach paths to other objects' initial locations. This is difficult without knowing the exact geometry of approach paths.
           
           However, a simpler heuristic might be to place objects as far away from remaining objects' initial locations as possible.
           Initial locations:
           v9 (v8): (0.046, -0.374, 0.781)
           v13 (v12): (-0.1, -0.312, 0.781)
           v15 (v14): (-0.242, -0.485, 0.781)
           v17 (v16): (0.172, 0.541, 0.781)
           
           Target locations:
           p4 (v8): (0.05, 0.05, 0.782)
           p5 (v12): (-0.05, 0.05, 0.782)
           p6 (v14): (0.05, -0.05, 0.782)
           p7 (v16): (-0.05, -0.05, 0.782)
           
           The problematic collision was `v12` at `p5` obstructing `pick v16 from v17`.
           The target location `p5` for `v12` is (-0.05, 0.05).
           The initial location `v17` for `v16` is (0.172, 0.541).
           These are far apart in Y.
           If the robot is positioned such that Y is "forward", then `v17` is "far forward and right". `p5` is "near and slightly left".
           The arm would have to reach for `v17`, and its path might swing over `p5`.
           
           Let's try to empty the initial location region first without placing anything onto the target surface `v18`.
           But the goal is to place on `v18`. We can't just move them somewhere else.
           
           Consider using `#o2` for intermediate placements? No, `#o2` is also supported by `v10` and `v18`, so it's a target pose, not a temporary holding pose. And the problem says: "If there are sufficient poses without '#' to solve the problem, you should use those poses instead of any with '#'.". So we should stick to p4, p5, p6, p7.
           
           The only strategy left is to carefully reorder the pick and place operations, trying to avoid collisions with already placed objects during future pick approaches.
           The collision happened when picking `v16` from `v17`, with `v12` at `p5`.
           
           What if we place `v16` and `v12` last? Or place them far apart on the target surface?
           p7 (-0.05, -0.05) and p5 (-0.05, 0.05) are both on the "left side" of v18.
           If the robot is operating from the "front" (say, positive Y side of v18), then the left side is "top-left" and "bottom-left".
           The initial position of v16 is v17 (0.172, 0.541). This is quite far from the target surface v18 which is centered at (0,0).
           
           Let's try to place `v16` and `v12` (the culprits from the previous failure) in such an order that they don't interfere.
           Specifically, `v12` at `p5` (top-left) collided with `pick` of `v16` from `v17`.
           This might suggest that placing `v12` at `p5` should be done *after* picking `v16`. Or, placing `v16` at `p7` (bottom-left) should be done first to free up its initial `v17` spot, before `v12` is placed.
           
           Let's try the sequence:
           1. `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`
           2. Pick `v8` from `v9`. Place `v8` at `p4` (top-right).
           3. Pick `v14` from `v15`. Place `v14` at `p6` (bottom-right).
              Now the right side of `v18` is occupied.
           4. Pick `v16` from `v17`.
              Now, `v16` is picked. `v12` is still at `v13`. No collision from `v12` at `p5` yet. This pick should be fine in this order.
           5. Place `v16` at `p7` (bottom-left).
              Now the bottom side of `v18` is occupied.
           6. Pick `v12` from `v13`.
           7. Place `v12` at `p5` (top-left).
              `p5` and `p7` are on the same side, but `p7` would be already occupied by `v16`.
              The `unsafeapproach` predicate is for *picking* from an initial pose. So the issue was with `pick(v16, v17, ...)`.
           
           The key to fix this is to ensure that when any `pick` action happens, the objects that could cause `unsafeapproach` issues are either not yet placed at their final poses, or are placed at final poses that don't cause collision.
           The objects causing collision `?o2` are those that are `atpose(?o2, ?p2)`.
           In the failed attempt, `v12` was at `p5` (`atpose(v12, p5)` was true) when picking `v16` from `v17`.
           To prevent this, we must pick `v16` (from `v17`) *before* placing `v12` at `p5`.
           
           Revised plan to avoid the specific collision:
           1. `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`
           2. Pick `v8` from `v9`.
           3. Place `v8` at `p4`. (v8 is at p4)
           4. Pick `v14` from `v15`.
           5. Place `v14` at `p6`. (v14 is at p6)
              At this point, `v12` is still at `v13`, `v16` is still at `v17`.
           6. Pick `v16` from `v17`. (This should not collide with `v12` at `p5` because `v12` is not yet at `p5`).
           7. Place `v16` at `p7`. (v16 is at p7)
           8. Pick `v12` from `v13`. (This should be fine, v16 is at p7, v8 at p4, v14 at p6, they might interfere with the arm movement for `v12` if paths overlap)
           9. Place `v12` at `p5`.
           
           This sequence ensures that `v12` is not at `p5` when `v16` is being picked from `v17`. This should fix the specific error encountered.
           Let's confirm the arguments used in the actions:
           `#o0`: `basemotion` trajectory (not a pose, so no value needed)
           `#o1`: `grasp` (not a pose, so no value needed)
           `#o3`: `bconf` (not a pose, so no value needed)
           `#o4`: `atraj` (not a pose, so no value needed)
           `#o2`: is a `pose`. `pose(v14, #o2)`, `pose(v16, #o2)`, `pose(v12, #o2)`, `pose(v8, #o2)`.
           The action instances show `pick/place` using `p4, p5, p6, p7, v9, v13, v15, v17`. No actions use `#o2`. So `#o2` is not used in this plan.
           Therefore, no poses need to be assigned continuous values.
           
           The plan looks solid based on rectifying the previous collision.
           
           --Plan--:
           (move_base v3 #o3 #o0)
           (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v8 p4 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v14 p6 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v16 p7 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v12 p5 #o1 #o3 #o4)
