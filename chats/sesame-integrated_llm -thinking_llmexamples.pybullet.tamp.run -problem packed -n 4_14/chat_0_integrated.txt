           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.242, -0.485, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.031).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.1, -0.312, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.849, 0.528).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.002, -0.418), (0.089, -0.331)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.129, 0.497), (0.215, 0.584)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.279, -0.522), (-0.204, -0.448)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.147, -0.359), (-0.054, -0.265)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.046, -0.374, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.6, 0.8).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.172, 0.541, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.602, 0.798).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Plan: Placing Objects on v18**
           
           Alright, here's the game plan: my goal is to get v8, v12, v14, and v16 all placed on top of v18. Currently, they're sitting on v11. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, but only v4 is ready for the task. The initial state tells me how the objects are supported, where the arms are and which poses correspond to those objects.
           
           First things first, I need to get the robot base into the right configuration for pick and place actions. The `kin` predicates indicate that I need to move the base from its initial location, v3, to the base configuration #o3. I'll do this at the start.
           
           Then comes the main loop: I'll pick up each object individually from its current pose on v11 and put it onto v18. I'll use the available action `place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`, where `v4` is my arm, `v8` (or the other objects) is the target, `#o2` is the target pose on v18, `#o1` is the grasp, `#o3` is the base config, and `#o4` is the arm trajectory. The initial state already tells me that each object is supported at the target pose, which is great.
           
           A key point, and this is important: since I need to place multiple objects at the same location – even if it's sequential – I need to give a *different* continuous value for the pose `#o2` for each object to avoid any collisions. Since I'm sequentially placing the objects, I'm going to carefully define a set of collision free locations on top of v18, each location corresponding to a specific object.
           
           Specifically, I'll provide distinct x, y, and z coordinates for `#o2` for each object. The z will be set at 0.781 for objects, because that is where they're located. I've calculated collision-free positions for them, keeping them within the bounds of v18's AABB.
           
           So, in summary: move base, pick each object from current pose, then place on v18 at its corresponding collision-free pose. Done and done!
