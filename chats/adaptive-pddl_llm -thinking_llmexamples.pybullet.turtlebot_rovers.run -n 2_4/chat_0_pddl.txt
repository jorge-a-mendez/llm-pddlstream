           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Impossibility of Achieving the Goal**
           
           Okay, here's the situation as I see it, given my expertise: I'm presented with the goal `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to satisfying a conjunction of several atomic facts.  After a thorough examination of the `new-axiom@0()` definition and its sub-goals, I've realized a significant constraint: the *only* actions I'm permitted to use are `move` and `drop_rock`. This dramatically limits what can be achieved.
           
           Breaking down the goal, I need to get `receivedimage` predicates for different objects, along with  `receivedanalysis` for some `stone` and `soil`. To satisfy these requirements, the planning system necessitates using actions like `send_image` and `send_analysis`. However, upon meticulously reviewing the allowed action instances provided, I found these *crucial* actions are missing. I can only move the rovers (v12 and v14) and drop rocks.
           
           The `send_image` actions, which are required to get the images and `send_analysis` that is needed to get the analysis reports, both have the condition of "haveimage", "sample_rock" as a precondition. Thus, I am unable to build a plan to meet the specified `new-axiom@0()` goal. The set of allowed actions simply doesn't contain the necessary tools to achieve the required state. The goal, as it stands, is therefore *unachievable* within the constraints of the problem.
