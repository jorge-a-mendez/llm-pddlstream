           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)

           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable and stackable objects: `v15`, `v8`, and `v12`. `v15` is currently at `v16` and supported by `v11`. `v8` is at `v9` and supported by `v11`. `v12` is at `v13` and supported by `v14`. There are two arms, `v6` and `v4`, both are handempty. The robot is at base configuration `v3`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be achieved if `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true.
           From the initial state, we know `type(v12, v17)` and `type(v8, v17)`. So, for `?green` we can use either `v12` or `v8`. Let's choose `v8`.
           Therefore, we need to achieve `on(v8, v18)`.
           The axiom for `on(?o, ?r)` states `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`.
           We are given `stackable(v8, v18)`.
           We have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. So we need to achieve `atpose(v8, #o2)`.
           
           However, the only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not change the pose of any object. Therefore, it's impossible to achieve the goal of placing `v8` on `v18` with the given available actions. The robot cannot pick or place any objects.
           
           The goal is to satisfy `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.
           From the initial state, we have `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`. So `?green` could be `v8` or `v12`.
           Let's try to achieve `on(v8, v18)`. This requires `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)`.
           We have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. So we need to achieve `atpose(v8, #o2)`.
           Currently, `atpose(v8, v9)`. There are no pick or place actions available to change the pose of `v8`.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable.
