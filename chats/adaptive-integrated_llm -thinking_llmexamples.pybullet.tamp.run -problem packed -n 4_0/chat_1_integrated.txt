User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.118, 0.44), (-0.04, 0.518)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.05, 0.322), (0.129, 0.401)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.138, -0.577), (-0.046, -0.485)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.294, -0.501), (-0.198, -0.404)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.079, 0.479, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.662, 0.75).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.089, 0.361, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.759, 0.651).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.092, -0.531, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.546, 0.838).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.246, -0.452, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.483, 0.876).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Breakdown for Object Placement**
           
           My goal is to position objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto surface `v18`. Initially, all objects reside on surface `v11`.  To achieve this, I'll employ a simple pick-and-place strategy for each object: retrieve it from its current position on `v11` and place it onto `v18`.
           
           Let's dissect this plan:
           
           1. **Object `v8`**: Currently on `v11`. I'll pick it up and deposit it onto `v18`.  The pick action involves lifting `v8` from its initial pose, while the place action involves supporting it at the target pose, all with the arm, `v4`.
           2. **Object `v12`**:  The same process as `v8` applies.
           3. **Object `v14`**: The identical action sequence is used.
           4. **Object `v16`**:  The sequence is the same.
           
           The key to successful execution lies in defining collision-free placement poses on `v18`. I need to ensure that the robot's actions are valid in terms of the underlying kinematics.  I've chosen the target poses by considering the dimensions of `v18` and attempting to arrange the objects in a 2x2 grid. I've also verified that the placements themselves will be collision-free, using the given AABBs.
           
           Specifically, I've assigned these coordinates for `#o2` on `v18`, with all `theta` set to 0.0 (the z value is always 0.781):
            -  `v8`: `0.07 0.07 0.781 0.0`
            -  `v12`: `-0.07 0.07 0.781 0.0`
            -  `v14`: `0.07 -0.07 0.781 0.0`
            -  `v16`: `-0.07 -0.07 0.781 0.0`
           
           The plan can be carried out using pick/place pairs, since all required `kin` predicates have been provided. The `kin` predicate is satisfied given the robot has valid grasps, configurations for base and trajectories, respectively.
           
           While the problem provided a `move_base` action, it's a no-op that results in no movement. The cost of this plan is solely due to the eight pick-and-place actions and since `distance(v3,v3)` is 0, the move base cost is zero.  There is no need for any other action. Therefore, I'll proceed with the following sequence:
           
           1.  `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           2.  `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           3.  `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           4.  `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           5.  `pick(v4, v14, v15, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           6.  `place(v4, v14, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           7.  `pick(v4, v16, v17, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           8.  `place(v4, v16, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           
           And with these actions, the goal is realized.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`.

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Impossibility of Reaching the Goal State**
           
           Okay, so I've been presented with a task, and it seems fundamentally flawed. The user correctly pointed out that every `pick` and `place` action I considered is invalid. The only allowed action instance is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`, meaning the robot can only move its base.
           
           The actual goal is pretty straightforward: get four objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`) *on* surface `v18`.  "On" is derived from the *supported* and *atpose* predicates, which makes sense.  Currently, each of the objects is *on* a different surface (`v11`).
           
           But here's the kicker: to get those objects *onto* `v18`, I'd need to manipulate their `atpose` predicates. I'd need to somehow change their poses to be supported by `v18`. That screams `pick` and `place` actions, right?  But no dice.  I'm limited to just `move_base`.
           
           It's immediately obvious. The `move_base` action doesn't *do* anything to the objects. It doesn't allow me to change their positions in any way. I can move the robot around, but I can't interact with the objects to move them.
           
           Therefore, with only `move_base` available, the goal state is simply *unachievable*.  I can't possibly satisfy the required `on` predicates using just the single action provided. It's a fundamental conflict.
