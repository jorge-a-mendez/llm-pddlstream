User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.118, 0.44), (-0.04, 0.518)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.05, 0.322), (0.129, 0.401)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.138, -0.577), (-0.046, -0.485)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.294, -0.501), (-0.198, -0.404)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.079, 0.479, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.662, 0.75).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.089, 0.361, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.759, 0.651).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.092, -0.531, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.546, 0.838).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.246, -0.452, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.483, 0.876).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Object Manipulation**
           
           My goal is to place objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto surface `v18`. Currently, these objects are on `v11`, and I need to move them to `v18`. The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, but the base `v3` is fixed, meaning I cannot move the robot.
           
           The core challenge is the interpretation of the allowable actions. The prompt mentions a specific `move_base` action instance, but given this is a TAMP problem, I am inferring that the more general `pick` and `place` actions *are* available, although their continuous parameters must be solved. The given `move_base` action, since it simply keeps the base fixed, contributes no effect and can be ignored.
           
           To achieve my objective, I must use a sequence of `pick` and `place` actions, utilizing arm `v4` for simplicity.
           
           My plan is as follows:
           
           1.  **Pick v8:**  Use `v4` to pick object `v8` from its current pose (`v9`) using grasp `#o1`. This requires solving for the kinematic trajectory `#atraj_pick_v8`.
           2.  **Place v8:** Place `v8` onto `v18` at a pose determined by the template `#o2`. This requires solving for `#atraj_place_v8`.
           3.  **Pick v12:** Use `v4` to pick object `v12` from its current pose (`v13`) using grasp `#o1`.  Solve for the trajectory `#atraj_pick_v12`.
           4.  **Place v12:** Place `v12` onto `v18` at a pose determined by the template `#o2`.  Solve for `#atraj_place_v12`.
           5.  **Pick v14:** Use `v4` to pick object `v14` from its current pose (`v15`) using grasp `#o1`. Solve for `#atraj_pick_v14`.
           6.  **Place v14:** Place `v14` onto `v18` at a pose determined by the template `#o2`. Solve for `#atraj_place_v14`.
           7.  **Pick v16:** Use `v4` to pick object `v16` from its current pose (`v17`) using grasp `#o1`. Solve for `#atraj_pick_v16`.
           8.  **Place v16:** Place `v16` onto `v18` at a pose determined by the template `#o2`.  Solve for `#atraj_place_v16`.
           
           All actions will be performed with base `v3`, which remains fixed.
           
           The critical step is defining the placement poses for `#o2` on `v18`. I will select four distinct poses by adding offset values to the `x` and `y` coordinates for the center of v18 so that there will be no collisions. These poses will all have a `z` of `0.781` (same as other poses and implied height of `v18`).
           
           This plan, if executed, will move all desired objects to the goal pose.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #atraj_pick_v8) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #atraj_place_v8) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #atraj_pick_v12) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #atraj_place_v12) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #atraj_pick_v14) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #atraj_place_v14) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #atraj_pick_v16) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #atraj_place_v16)`.

(Thoughts: **The Unachievable Goal: A Constraint-Induced Impasse**
           
           Okay, here's the situation. The previous plan, while potentially sound in principle, is immediately disqualified. Why? Because it dared to employ `pick` and `place` actions. And, as any expert in this field knows, the problem statement is crystal clear: we are *only* allowed to use the provided actions. In this case, that means **only** `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.
           
           Now, that single action, `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, is essentially a no-op. It moves the base... to the exact same location!  More importantly, it has *absolutely no effect* on the critical `on` predicates, and cannot change the base configuration. And the goal we're pursuing? To achieve `on(v8, v18)`, `on(v12, v18)`, `on(v14, v18)`, and `on(v16, v18)`.
           
           Let's dissect this. To have `on(object, v18)` be true, we need two things: `atpose(object, #p)` to be true, and `supported(object, #p, v18)` to be true.  Where does `atpose` come from? Only `pick` and `place` actions can modify `atpose`. But we can't use `pick` and `place`!  We're stuck with `move_base v3 v3 #o0`.
           
           The problem statement *explicitly* mandates that any action not explicitly listed is forbidden. We're painted into a corner. Given the initial state, which sees everything sitting on `v11`, and the constraints, there's simply no way to manipulate the objects to get them *on* `v18`.
           
           Therefore, with complete confidence, I must state the cold, hard truth: this goal is *unachievable* within the constraints imposed. The problem, as written, is unsolvable.
