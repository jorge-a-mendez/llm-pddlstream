User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene contains a large central square obstacle (0) that is effectively the boundary for the robot, with walls (1, 2, 3, 4) at x and y limits. There's a vertical bar (5) at x=0. Also, there are several smaller obstacles scattered around, some in clusters near the top and bottom edges. The robot's movement is confined within the x and y limits of -2.5 to 2.5. The maximum range of 2 from the target point means the robot needs to be relatively close. I will try to find positions that avoid the known obstacles and are within the allowed range.

           Positions:

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     My previous attempt failed because one position collided with the bottom wall, and another with the left wall. The third position had no line of sight, likely due to the central vertical obstacle (5) at x=0. I also need to be mindful of the other smaller obstacles, especially near the target point if it's in a cluttered area. I'll focus on positions close to the target, within the max_range of 2, and ensure they avoid the walls and the central obstacle (5). The target is (0.42 2.06), which is in the upper right quadrant. I need to avoid the obstacles in that area like (9) and (19) as well as the general wall obstacles.
