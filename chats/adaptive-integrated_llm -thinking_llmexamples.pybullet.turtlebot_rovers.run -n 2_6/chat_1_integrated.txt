           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Plan Summary for `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan, as I see it. My goal is to achieve all the conditions specified in `new-axiom@0()`, which basically boils down to getting two images and two analyses.  Here's how I'm thinking of tackling it:
           
           First, I need to get images of two specific objectives (v17 and v18) using mode v11.  To do this, I have to:
           
           1.  **Image Acquistion (and Mode):** Get the rover to the right spot, take the picture, calibrate the camera, and send the image to the lander.  The rovers I have are v12 and v14, and each has a camera (v10). I'll need to move each rover to its respective image capture location, calibrate the camera, take the image and then move to a comms point.
           
               *   Rover v12 will handle objective v17:
           
                   *   I'll start v12 at configuration `v13`.
                   *   Then, move it to configuration `#o3` which has the right angle to capture an image of target `v17`.  (Note: I'll need to define this config: it's a value with collision-free coordinates).
                   *   I'll calibrate the camera, take the picture, and then move v12 to the comms point at configuration `#o0` to upload the image.
                   *   Finally I'll move back to `v13`.
           
               *   Rover v14 will handle objective v18:
           
                   *   Starting at configuration `v15`
                   *   I'll do a similar process for v14 and for objective v18.
                   *   I'll move v14 to another value of `#o3` that is specific to v14 and v18.
                   *   Once again calibrate the camera, and take the shot.
                   *   Move v14 over to config `#o0` for comms.
                   *   Go back to the start.
           
           2.  **Analysis Acquisition**: I need to take some soil and rock samples.
           
               *   For the soil sample I'll use rover v12.
                   *   Since rover v12 is already at config `#o0`, I'll use a `motion` and `sample_rock`.
                   *   Move v12 to configuration `#o5` to grab a sample of rock v5.
                   *   Send the analysis to the lander and return.
           
               *   For the rock sample I'll use rover v14.
                   *   Move v14 to `#o5` to get the analysis of rock v4.
                   *   Send analysis and return.
           
               *   **Crucially:** After each sample is taken, I have to ensure that `free` is restored. This means I have to `drop_rock`.
           
           To finalize this plan, I need to make some specific choices for the abstract configurations and make sure all the preconditions are met and all the `motion` steps work.
           Specifically, I will need values for the configuration objects:
           `#o0` will represent the lander comm location.
           `#o3` will represent an image-capture location, specific for v17 and specific for v18.
           `#o5` will represent a rock/soil sampling location.
           And all the other parameters (#) are rays and trajectories that the system should be able to derive based on the geometric information.
           
           Once that is done, I should be able to get these goals done efficiently.
           
           This plan hits all the subgoals (`receivedimage`, `receivedanalysis`) while maintaining the `free` predicate, ensuring the final configuration is what it started with.

                   *   Starting at configuration `v15`
                   *   I'll do a similar process for v14 and for objective v18.
                   *   I'll move v14 to another value of `#o3` that is specific to v14 and v18.
                   *   Once again calibrate the camera, and take the shot.
                   *   Move v14 over to config `#o0` for comms.
                   *   Go back to the start.
           
           2.  **Analysis Acquisition**: I need to take some soil and rock samples.
           
               *   For the soil sample I'll use rover v12.
                   *   Since rover v12 is already at config `#o0`, I'll use a `motion` and `sample_rock`.
                   *   Move v12 to configuration `#o5` to grab a sample of rock v5.
                   *   Send the analysis to the lander and return.
           
               *   For the rock sample I'll use rover v14.
                   *   Move v14 to `#o5` to get the analysis of rock v4.
                   *   Send analysis and return.
           
               *   **Crucially:** After each sample is taken, I have to ensure that `free` is restored. This means I have to `drop_rock`.
           
           To finalize this plan, I need to make some specific choices for the abstract configurations and make sure all the preconditions are met and all the `motion` steps work.
           Specifically, I will need values for the configuration objects:
           `#o0` will represent the lander comm location.
           `#o3` will represent an image-capture location, specific for v17 and specific for v18.
           `#o5` will represent a rock/soil sampling location.
           And all the other parameters (#) are rays and trajectories that the system should be able to derive based on the geometric information.
           
           Once that is done, I should be able to get these goals done efficiently.
           
           This plan hits all the subgoals (`receivedimage`, `receivedanalysis`) while maintaining the `free` predicate, ensuring the final configuration is what it started with.

(Thoughts: **Refined Plan: A Single Rover's Odyssey**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan, based on the feedback and my understanding of the landscape. It's a solo mission for rover `v14`.  I've simplified things to ensure everything gets done safely and efficiently. `v12` is staying put, a strategic decision.
           
           **The Mission:**
           
           My objective is to have the following: (1) `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, (2) `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, (3) `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, and (4) `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           **Key Locations and Configurations:**
           
           *   **Initial:** `v14` starts at `v15` which is `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           *   **Imaging Objective 1 (`v17`):**  I'll position myself at `(-2.0, 1.0)`, which I'll label as configuration `#o3` for `v14` targeting `v17`.  This gives a reasonable viewing angle and is reachable without collision.
           *   **Imaging Objective 2 (`v18`):**  Next, I'll move to `(-0.62, 1.0)`, also labeled as `#o3` but now for `v14` and `v18`. This gives me line-of-sight to the `v18`. This point is outside the bounds of `v19`
           *   **Communication Hub:** I'll establish comms at `(-1.5, -1.8)`, my `#o0` configuration for `v14` and `v9`. This is close enough for a good signal but clear of any obstructions.
           *   **Sampling:** I'll be sampling the soil.
               *   `v1` (stone) will be sampled by #o5 near it.
               *   `v5` (soil) will be sampled by #o5 near it.
           
           **Action Plan (Detailed Steps):**
           
           1.  **Objective Imaging 1**: Move from `v15` to  `(-2.0, 1.0)`  (my `#o3` for `v14` and `v17`). Calibrate the camera, take the picture of the objective `v17`.
           2.  **Objective Imaging 2**: Move from the previous camera config to `(-0.62, 1.0)`. Calibrate the camera for  `v18`.  and take image of it.
           3.  **Soil Sample 1:** Move near `v1` to sample with `sample_rock`.
           4.  **Send analysis:** Move to `(-1.5, -1.8)` and send the analyses and images.
           5.  **Re-Orient:** Move to sample near `v5`.
           6.  **Send analysis and reports.** Move to `(-1.5, -1.8)` and send the analyses
           7.  **Return**: Head back to my starting position at `v15`.
           
           **Addressing the Feedback:**
           
           *   I've carefully selected the `#o3` and `#o0` configurations to avoid the problem locations identified in the previous feedback, particularly obstacle `v19`. I've made certain no `motion` is in a collision path.
           *   `v12` will not participate in moving, making the plan safer and easier. Its conditions of `atconf` and `free` remain in the initial state of the problem.
           *   The strategy for rock sampling has been simplified. Instead of making the rover bounce from object to rover to communications, one rover (myself, `v14`) does all the steps, minimizing the number of path segments.
           
           **Final Configurations:**
           
           *   `(#o3 v14 #o4 v17)`:  `(-2.0, 1.0)` (imaging of `v17`)
           *   `(#o3 v14 #o4 v18)`:  `(-0.62, 1.0)` (imaging of `v18`)
           *   `(#o0 v14 #o1 v9)`: `(-1.5, -1.8)` (communication)
           
           I'm confident this revised plan addresses all previous issues and aligns with my goal.  Let's get this mission moving!

(Thoughts: **Revised Strategy for Rover Tasking**
           
           Okay, so the initial plan hit a snag. The system flagged that the planned rover moves resulted in collisions or were simply unreachable.  I need to revisit the whole setup, considering both the rover's capabilities and the environment's layout. My objective remains the same: complete `new-axiom@0()`, but this time I'll make sure to get it right.
           
           **Recalibrating for Reachability and Collision Avoidance**
           
           Based on the feedback, I need to focus on two things: clear paths and collision-free configurations.  Here's the plan. I'll make sure each rover's actions are both achievable and safe.
           
           **Focus on the Goal:**
           
           The key to success remains the eight conditions laid out earlier.  I've got to make sure rovers successfully take images, receive images, send communications, and process the analysis as required.
           
           **Understanding the Obstacles**
           
           I've got a much clearer idea of what went wrong before.  Here's a breakdown:
           
           *   **Initial Plan Problem:** The previous plan had issues with collisions (with the lander or the obstacle), as well as significant changes in coordinates.
           *   **The Right Approach:** I need to approach these rover configurations with better knowledge of obstacle avoidance and range.
           
           **Re-Evaluating the Rovers and Their Tasks**
           
           I've concluded that it's much more efficient to use both rovers.  The layout suggests a split in tasks, using v14 for tasks in the Northwest and v12 for tasks on the Northeast. Here's the task breakdown:
           
           *   **v14:** This one will handle the imagery and the communication tasks, including:
               *   Getting images of the objectives (v17, v18)
               *   Analyzing the stone (v1)
               *   Sending images to and receiving data from the lander (v9)
           *   **v12:** This rover will have a simple load, which is:
               *   Analyze the soil (v7) and
               *   Sending the data (v7) to the lander (v9)
           
           **Creating Plans**
           
           Okay, now for the details. I will map out paths for each rover to make sure this all works:
           
           **Plan for Rover v14:**
           
           1.  **Objective Images:** This rover needs to get images of v17 and v18. I will have the rover go near the location of each objective and get an image. It starts at `v15` which has the coordinates `(-1.0, -1.75)`. For objective v17, the coordinate is at `(-1.96, 1.88)`. Now, for the first imaging point, I will place the rover at `(-1.96, 0.0)`. For objective v18, the point will be `(-0.62, 2.1)` and I'll place the rover at the point `(-0.62, 0.5)`. This means it has to travel above the rover obstacle.
           2.  **Sampling the Stone:** `v14` then needs to analyze the stone (v1), which is located at `(-1.93, 1.31)`. The rover will move to the location of the stone with the coordinate `(-1.93, 1.0)`.
           3.  **Lander Communication:** Now, v14 has to send its images and samples to the lander. The lander (v9) is located at `(-1.9, -2.0)`. v14 will move to a point near this lander: `(-1.5, -1.0)`.
           4.  Once at the lander, it will be able to begin communications.
           
           **Plan for Rover v12:**
           
           1.  **Sample and Communicate:** `v12` will take a sample and relay data. For the sample, the location for the soil is `(2.07, 1.25)`, which will allow `v12` to get to the location `(2.07, 1.0)`.
           2.  After the analysis, `v12` can then go to the communication site with `v9` at location `(0.0, -1.0)`.
           
           **Detailed Execution:**
           
           I'm ready to move forward. The next step is to detail each rover's actions, making sure they happen safely and efficiently. I will use the configurations I've mapped out to make sure everything comes together as needed.

           4.  Once at the lander, it will be able to begin communications.

(Thoughts: **Okay, let's break down this planning problem.** We've got a situation where the previous plans had some issues, likely with reaching certain spots, avoiding collisions, or maybe even with the right formatting of the plan itself. I need to re-evaluate the object positions and rover capabilities to find new valid configurations.
           
           The overall target is `new-axiom@0()`, but we've got to ensure the following conditions are met:
           1.  Rovers `v12` and `v14` are in specific configurations `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` at the end.
           2.  The area around those configurations needs to be free.
           3.  We need to receive images from two objects.
           4.  We must perform and receive an analysis of a rock (stone) and soil.
           
           **Key Issues and Strategies:**
           
           *   **Reachability:**  Can the rovers actually *get* to where they need to go? Are the coordinates reachable, or is there some underlying constraint I'm missing?
           *   **Collision:**  I need to make sure the rovers don't bump into anything, especially obstacles.
           *   **Visibility:**  For imaging and communication, we need a clear line of sight, and this is handled by ray and free ray predicates.
           
           **Objects and their approximate positions:**
           We have two rovers at specific starting points, some rocks of type v2 and v6, a lander, and two static obstacles.
           
           **Based on the issues and previous attempts, I'm going to revise the plan:**
           
           *   **Rover `v14` will be the primary operator, handling all tasks** as it's the more suitable of the rovers to traverse across the objective locations and the path is much less obstructed.
           *   The communication target `v9` is too far away from `v12` for reliable communication considering the obstacle `v20`. So, `v14` will also be responsible for communication.
           *   I need new, reachable, and collision-free configurations for both imaging targets and the rock sampling.
           
           **Here's the refined plan for `v14`:**
           
           1.  **Image `v17` (Target: approx (-1.96, 1.88))**
               *   Configuration Name: `o3`
               *   Coordinates: Let's position it to `(-1.5, 1.0)`. This should be accessible.
               *   Actions: Move, calibrate, and take the image.
           2.  **Image `v18` (Target: approx (-0.62, 2.1))**
               *   Configuration Name: `o3`
               *   Coordinates: I'll use `(-0.6, 1.5)` This is near the target and clear of obstacles
               *   Actions: Move, calibrate, and take the image.
           3.  **Sample `v1` (stone, type v2)**
               *   Configuration Name: `#o5` (above the rock)
               *   Coordinates: `(-1.9, 1.5)`. Accessible.
               *   Actions: Move and sample.
           4.  **Send Analysis & Images to `v9`**
               *   Configuration Name: `#o0` (near `v9`, at a reliable communication distance)
               *   Coordinates: `(-1.0, -1.0)`. Clear of `v20`.
               *   Actions:  Move, send the analysis of `v1`, the images.
           5.  **Drop `v1`**.
               *   Action: drop_rock.
           6.  **Sample `v5` (soil, type v6)**
               *   Configuration Name: `#o5` (above the rock)
               *   Coordinates: `(-1.9, 0.8)`. Accessible.
               *   Actions: Move and sample.
           7.  **Send analysis of `v5` to `v9`**
               *   Configuration Name: `#o0`
               *   Coordinates: `(-1.0, -1.0)`.
               *   Actions: move and send the analysis.
           8.  **Drop `v5`**.
               *   Action: drop_rock.
           9.  **Return to Initial Configuration.**
           
           For the final output, I'll need to remember that even though I'm reusing the variable names for the configs, I need to represent them specifically with the individual `(conf_name, rover_name, ray_name, target_name)` tuples.

(Thoughts: **Refined Rover Plan and Configuration Selection**
           
           The goal is to revise a previously failed plan, focusing on a single rover's actions. The initial analysis revealed communication challenges due to a wall, requiring that rover `v14` handle imaging, analysis, and communication with the lander. The prompt's emphasis on specific continuous object parameters guides the approach. The key challenge lies in satisfying reachability, collision-free conditions, and constraints on image and communication ranges while only providing values for `#o3` and `#o0`.
           
           The plan entails the rover `v14` performing a series of actions: capturing images of two objectives, collecting and analyzing samples from two rocks, and transmitting images/analysis to the lander. After an initial assessment of obstacle and rock positions, the plan is to use configurations for image and communication predicates. I've re-reviewed the initial and re-used coordinates for the positions of the rovers, objectives, lander, rocks, and obstacles to avoid collisions, reach targets, and adhere to visibility constraints.
           
           I need to satisfy the constraints of the task by applying specific values. Configuration `#o3` is needed at `(-1.9, 0.5)` for the first image and `(-0.6, 0.8)` for the second. Configuration `#o0` will be used for communication at `(-1.9, -1.0)`.
           
           Specifically, `#o5` for sampling rocks does *not* need to be given continuous values because the `conf` object is not used in the initial state of the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicates, therefore, as instructed, I will not provide these values.

(Thoughts: **Updated Configuration Plan for Rover v14**
           
           Based on the feedback and the revised environmental constraints, I've re-evaluated the configurations for rover `v14` to ensure it can successfully complete its mission of analyzing rocks and communicating with the lander. The key challenge is the wall at x=0, which forces `v14` to handle all communication and observation tasks.
           
           Here's the new plan:
           
           1.  **Initial State & Movement:** `v14` starts at initial position `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           2.  **Image Objective v17:**
               *   `v14` moves to a position to image objective `v17`. The optimal position is calculated as (-1.9, 0.0), which provides a clear line of sight, meeting a 2.0 max range, and avoids obstacles.
           3.  **Image Objective v18:**
               *   `v14` then moves to (-0.5, 0.5) to image the objective `v18` and avoids collision.
           4.  **Sample Rock v1:**
               *   `v14` moves to coordinates (-1.9, 1.3) to sample the rock `v1`. This ensures it's positioned above the rock for sampling.
           5.  **Communicate:**
               *   `v14` moves to coordinates (-1.0, -1.5) to have a clear communication with the lander `v9`. This is in range and ensures all data can be transmitted, which should include the rock data collected and images of `v17` and `v18`.
           6.  **Sample Rock v5:**
               *   `v14` then moves to (-1.9, 0.6) to collect the sample from soil rock `v5`.
           7.  **Communicate:**
               *   `v14` then goes to (-1.0, -1.5) and transmits the data to the lander.
           8.  **Return to v15:**
               *   `v14` then heads back to its initial position.
           
           This plan should be fully collision-free, reachable, and allow for all required observations and communications, optimizing for the new environmental constraints.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Plan for Rover Communication and Analysis**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to achieve the `new-axiom@0()` goal in the `rovers` domain. After reviewing the current state, potential obstacles, and previous failures, I've devised a focused strategy:
           
           My primary focus is on rover `v14` as the sole communicator. Rover `v12` is sidelined due to the communication constraints imposed by the wall at x=0. Therefore, all tasks will be executed by `v14`. I'll organize my plan into distinct steps, ensuring I account for reachability and collision checks for each stage.
           
           First, I need to image two objectives: `v17` and `v18`. I'll set a config point `#o3` for `v14` for each, ensuring that `imagevisible` is met. To image `v17`, I'll use coordinate (-1.0, 1.0) and to image `v18`, I'll use coordinate (-0.6, 1.0).
           
           Next, sampling rocks. I can sample both type `v2` (stone) and `v6` (soil) from config `#o5`. Because `#o5` is not listed in `imagevisible` or `comvisible` in the initial state, I don't have to provide its coordinate.
           
           After rock sampling, I need to communicate with the lander `v9`. I'll set comm config `#o0` at coordinate (-1.0, -1.0) to send images and analysis from both sampled rocks.
           
           Lastly, I need to return to `v15` for the goal to succeed. I plan for a straight vertical move.
           
           **Final Configuration Strategy**
           
           The crucial aspect of the configuration step is defining coordinates for `imagevisible` and `comvisible` requirements. Because `v14` is imaging two distinct objectives (`v17`, `v18`) and communicating to lander `v9`, I need to provide continuous values for each unique (rover, target object) combination. Therefore:
           
           -   `#o3` to image `v17`: (-1.0, 1.0)
           -   `#o3` to image `v18`: (-0.6, 1.0)
           -   `#o0` to communicate to `v9`: (-1.0, -1.0)

Model:     **Strategic Plan for Rover Communication and Analysis**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to achieve the `new-axiom@0()` goal in the `rovers` domain. After reviewing the current state, potential obstacles, and previous failures, I've devised a focused strategy:
