           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Plan's Feasibility**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to: get images of two objectives, and get analyses of a rock and some soil.  I've got two rovers, v12 at configuration v13 and v14 at v15.  Each has a camera (v10), and they can potentially communicate with the lander, v9.  The challenge?  The initial state facts are such that the rovers *must* move to different configurations (configurations labeled with #o's) to even *see* what they need to image or sample.
           
           My analysis reveals a critical constraint: I can *only* use the `move` action instances that are explicitly allowed. This is the crux of the problem. My plan starts by evaluating the preconditions of the required subgoals, determining that for the images to be obtained, the rovers need to `take_image`, then `send_image`. The `send_image` requires the rovers be `comvisible`, and the `take_image` requires them to be `imagevisible` at that configuration. For the `receivedanalysis` predicates, I need to use `sample_rock` which requires being `above` the target rock or soil. These `comvisible`, `imagevisible`, and `above` conditions are not true at the rovers' current configurations, v13 and v15, but instead require configurations that begin with "#o." The actions available to me, the only moves I can use, are (move v12 v13 #o2 v13) and (move v14 v15 #o2 v15). These moves just repeat the rovers current states and do not allow the rover to move to any of the "#o" states required. This means the images cannot be taken, and the samples cannot be done, so the objective is *impossible* to achieve given the allowed actions. Therefore, I need to report this goal is unreachable.
