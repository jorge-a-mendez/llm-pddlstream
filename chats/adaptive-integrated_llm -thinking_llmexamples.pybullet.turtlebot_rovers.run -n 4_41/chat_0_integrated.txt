           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, but this looks like a puzzle. The goal is a conjunction of several conditions: `atconf`, `free`, `receivedimage`, and `receivedanalysis`.  Crucially, several of these depend on being *at* certain configurations (`atconf`). The initial state gives me some 'truths' like `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`.  I've got the `send_image`, `take_image`, `calibrate`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions available.  My initial assessment is that I need to somehow move rovers (`v12`, `v14`) to different configurations to make progress.
           
           **The Configuration Conundrum**
           
           Here's where it gets sticky. The `imagevisible` predicates tell me what each rover "sees" *from* specific configurations: `#o3` for `v12` and `#o5` for both rovers, and `#o0` for comms. The problem is, while I know that `v12` *has* configurations like `#o3` and `#o0`, I only *know* it's *at* `v13`. The rules of the game explicitly state that anything *not* in the initial state is false.  I have move actions which only move me from `v13` to `v13` (or `v15` to `v15`). There are no moves for `v12` to `atconf(#o3)` or for `v14` to `atconf(#o5)`.
           
           **Obstacles and Implications**
           
           To achieve the `receivedimage` goals, I would need to use `take_image` at the right configurations (`#o3`). Similarly for `send_analysis` I would need configuration `#o5` and `comvisible`. But because I can't *move* to these crucial configurations, I can't actually *use* the vision and communication capabilities implied by `imagevisible` and `comvisible`. The same problem plagues the analysis action. I can't sample rocks because I am never at the proper configurations.
           
           **The Unsolvable Nature of the Problem**
           
           The crux is this: the only moves I *have* are identity moves (staying put). With the explicit rule about facts being false unless they are in the initial state, I can't *become* `atconf` the configurations I *need* to be at. Because of this, the preconditions for `take_image` and `send_image` and `sample_rock` are *never* met. I've re-read the problem statement very carefully. The valid actions instances and the available initial predicates make the goal `new-axiom@0()` unachievable, as the robot can not fulfill the preconditions to take the appropriate actions to resolve the problem. The goal is unreachable.
