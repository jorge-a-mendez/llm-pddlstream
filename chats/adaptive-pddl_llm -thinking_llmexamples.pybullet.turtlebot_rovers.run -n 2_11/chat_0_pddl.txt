           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unachievable Goal: A Plan Analysis**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan to fulfill the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This seemingly straightforward task quickly reveals significant obstacles. Upon examining the target conditions, specifically the requirements for `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`, I realized that the core actions needed to satisfy these are absent.
           
           The goal necessitates obtaining images and analyzing samples. My initial strategy involved identifying and employing `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, along with their respective prerequisites, like `take_image`, `sample_rock`, `calibrate`. However, the crucial problem arose when I reviewed the *provided* list of permissible action instances. Only `move` and `drop_rock` actions were present.
           
           This limitation is a fundamental constraint. The absence of key actions like `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` means the essential predicates – `receivedimage`, `receivedanalysis`,  `analyzed`, `haveimage`, and `calibrated` –  cannot be achieved. The available `move` actions simply reposition rovers, and `drop_rock` requires a `full` state, which is not attainable given the limited available actions. The conditions `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)` are already met.
           
           Based on this analysis, I have to conclude that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently *unachievable* within the constraints of the provided action instance list. There is no way to attain the critical conditions necessary without those key action instances that are missing from the list.
