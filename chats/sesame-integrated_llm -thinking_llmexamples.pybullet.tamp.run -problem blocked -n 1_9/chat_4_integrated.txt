           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.
           
           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q0', '#t1'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q0', '#q1', '#t3'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', '#p0', '#g0', '#q1', '#t2'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-traj-pose:('#t0', 'v15', 'v16')->()`, which impeded executing the action pick('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0').
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions. If the failure occurs after placing on any pose that does not start with '#', it may be due to using a combination of invalid poses.As the expert, you may decide to choose additional poses, providing their continuous values using any free pose starting with '#'. 

(Thoughts: **Goal Comprehension and Plan Generation**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate target is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. Examining the axioms, this translates to making both `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` true. I've got a handle on the `type` part, since several objects fit the bill. The challenge is `on(?green, v18)`. That means getting an object, which I'll initially assume is `v8`, onto `v18`. I see that `v8` is a viable candidate as it's graspable and has the right `type`. I believe that `v18` is a table surface.
           
           Now, my initial plan involves:
           
           1.  **Move the Robot**: Get the robot arm to a base configuration to pick up the object.
           2.  **Pick Object**:  Successfully pick `v8`.
           3.  **Place Object**: Place `v8` on the correct table.
           
           I've looked at the available actions for moving, picking, and placing. There is a `pick` action available.
           
           However, a closer look at the preconditions reveals a potential roadblock called `new-axiom@0(?o)`. Now, this is where it gets a little tricky. If this axiom strictly means "there is *no other* graspable object," that could prevent the picking action since there are multiple graspable objects. Then `on` is not achievable.
           
           **Addressing the Obstacles and Refining the Strategy**
           
           The previous plan failed because it was colliding. I need a more sophisticated plan. The problem is a collision. My assumption is if there is only one object, the `~new-axiom@0(?o)` is true, allowing me to pick the object.
           
           I need to move the blocking object. In the previous plan, it collided with the trajectory of picking `v8`. The collision was specifically with object `v15` at a location `v16`. Given that trajectory. I can try the following plan:
           
           1.  **Move the Robot (again)**:  Get the robot arm ready.
           2.  **Move v15**:  Pick up and relocate `v15` to a safe location.
           3.  **Move the Robot (for object)**: Move the robot arm to be in a position to pick v8 or the object.
           4.  **Pick v8 or a viable object**:  Successfully pick the table object.
           5.  **Place Object**: Put the object on the target.
           
           I need the values for base configurations and the pose of v15 to place.  I am thinking this solves the problem of a collision.
           
           I have found a path for this strategy to place the object and solve the goal.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Fact is not satisfied: Atom new-axiom@0()`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Plan to Satisfy the Goal**
           
           Okay, so the last attempt failed because the goal, which I identified as `on(?green, v18) and type(?green, v17)`, wasn't met. I was pretty sure the problem was with the placement of `v12` on `v18`. Initially, I thought I had a handle on things, but it seems there's a problem with the graspable object and the `pick` preconditions.
           
           Let me go back through the axioms. I noticed a couple of axioms related to `new-axiom@0()`, one that takes an object and one that doesn't. My hunch is that the one without the argument is the key. It looks like the target goal should be about having an object `on(something, v18)` and that object needs a matching type that's given. This is where I derived my initial plan to place `v12` on `v18`.
           
           The error message specifically says the goal wasn't met. This means `on(v12, v18)` was somehow false after running my plan. But I ensured `atpose` with the placement and used the `supported` statement.
           
           So the plan had: `place v4 v12 #o2 #g1 #o3 #o4` where `#o2` is a pose I designated as (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0), a seemingly logical spot for a block on the surface `v18`. I know, I made it sound complicated. Anyway, the plan should have set `atpose(v12, #o2)` which, when combined with my earlier assertion of `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`, would've meant `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           The crucial thing I need to confirm is that all the *preconditions* of the `place` action are met. These include: `kin`, `atgrasp`, `atbconf`, no collisions (`unsafepose` and `unsafeapproach`) and no dangerous arm trajectories (`unsafeatraj`). I meticulously checked the `kin` relationship. I had to ensure the base and arm positions were defined. Then the collision-free pose for `#o2` has to be considered. Then, I needed to make sure it's geometrically sound. I followed the provided rules for `#o2` and the specific pose I determined. It needed to be inside the AABB dimensions of `v18` so I ensured the `x` and `y` coordinates fit.
           
           However, I'm now reconsidering the `new-axiom@0(?o)` axiom.  I initially thought it was a negation related to `pick`, making it impossible, but the problem statement says "never give up". The problem is that the given PDDL seems to make `pick` impossible because there are multiple graspable objects. However, there is a set of valid action instances, so this can't be true, or else the planner would have already failed. Perhaps there's an issue with how the axiom functions, or I'm misinterpreting it. Let me check the provided axioms one more time. I found one for `new-axiom@0(?o)` and `new-axiom@0()`. The one with the argument is for `pick` actions, and its meaning makes it impossible because another object could always be graspable. Then, the other axiom is the *actual goal* I must achieve to satisfy the problem's criteria.
           
           Given the goal and the preconditions of the `place` action, the problem *should* be solvable. I defined a position, and it should meet all requirements for the actions. Perhaps the problem is, in part, the placement. I needed to ensure a stable and collision-free position for `v12` to be on `v18`. The dimensions of both were used to ensure everything fits.
           
           Let's say the pick action *is* valid. Then, I need to focus on where I place the object. I'll stick with placing `v12` on `v18`.
           
           So, in the end, I need to try this plan with a slight modification to the placement. The robot will move to a slightly different position and then place `v12` on `v18`. I will keep the pose within the established limits, making sure there is no collision or placement issue. I'll make sure to verify the geometry of the situation, the robot path, and the surface.

Model:     **Re-evaluating the Plan to Satisfy the Goal**
           
           Okay, so the last attempt failed because the goal, which I identified as `on(?green, v18) and type(?green, v17)`, wasn't met. I was pretty sure the problem was with the placement of `v12` on `v18`. Initially, I thought I had a handle on things, but it seems there's a problem with the graspable object and the `pick` preconditions.
           
           Let me go back through the axioms. I noticed a couple of axioms related to `new-axiom@0()`, one that takes an object and one that doesn't. My hunch is that the one without the argument is the key. It looks like the target goal should be about having an object `on(something, v18)` and that object needs a matching type that's given. This is where I derived my initial plan to place `v12` on `v18`.
           
           The error message specifically says the goal wasn't met. This means `on(v12, v18)` was somehow false after running my plan. But I ensured `atpose` with the placement and used the `supported` statement.
           
           So the plan had: `place v4 v12 #o2 #g1 #o3 #o4` where `#o2` is a pose I designated as (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0), a seemingly logical spot for a block on the surface `v18`. I know, I made it sound complicated. Anyway, the plan should have set `atpose(v12, #o2)` which, when combined with my earlier assertion of `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`, would've meant `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           The crucial thing I need to confirm is that all the *preconditions* of the `place` action are met. These include: `kin`, `atgrasp`, `atbconf`, no collisions (`unsafepose` and `unsafeapproach`) and no dangerous arm trajectories (`unsafeatraj`). I meticulously checked the `kin` relationship. I had to ensure the base and arm positions were defined. Then the collision-free pose for `#o2` has to be considered. Then, I needed to make sure it's geometrically sound. I followed the provided rules for `#o2` and the specific pose I determined. It needed to be inside the AABB dimensions of `v18` so I ensured the `x` and `y` coordinates fit.
           
           However, I'm now reconsidering the `new-axiom@0(?o)` axiom.  I initially thought it was a negation related to `pick`, making it impossible, but the problem statement says "never give up". The problem is that the given PDDL seems to make `pick` impossible because there are multiple graspable objects. However, there is a set of valid action instances, so this can't be true, or else the planner would have already failed. Perhaps there's an issue with how the axiom functions, or I'm misinterpreting it. Let me check the provided axioms one more time. I found one for `new-axiom@0(?o)` and `new-axiom@0()`. The one with the argument is for `pick` actions, and its meaning makes it impossible because another object could always be graspable. Then, the other axiom is the *actual goal* I must achieve to satisfy the problem's criteria.
           
           Given the goal and the preconditions of the `place` action, the problem *should* be solvable. I defined a position, and it should meet all requirements for the actions. Perhaps the problem is, in part, the placement. I needed to ensure a stable and collision-free position for `v12` to be on `v18`. The dimensions of both were used to ensure everything fits.
           
           Let's say the pick action *is* valid. Then, I need to focus on where I place the object. I'll stick with placing `v12` on `v18`.
           
           So, in the end, I need to try this plan with a slight modification to the placement. The robot will move to a slightly different position and then place `v12` on `v18`. I will keep the pose within the established limits, making sure there is no collision or placement issue. I'll make sure to verify the geometry of the situation, the robot path, and the surface. I also reviewed the base configuration for movement.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Fact is not satisfied: Atom new-axiom@0()`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The core issue is the plan failing to achieve the goal: `on(?green, v18) and type(?green, v17)`. The obvious suspect is that the final `place` action isn't quite working right. The `type` part is static, so I'm focusing on why `on(v12, v18)` might remain false after the `place` action.
           
           There's some confusion in the problem definition with the `new-axiom@0()` axioms, but I'm going with the understanding that the goal is the one with *no* arguments.
           
           **Analysis of the Goal and the `place` Action**
           
           For `on(v12, v18)` to be true, we need `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` (which is in the initial state) and `atpose(v12, #o2)`. Since the previous failure didn't explicitly mention problems with the robot trajectory or collision, it seems the `place` action completed, but the conditions for `on` weren't satisfied. 
           
           The trouble with previous failed attempt was that `on(v12, v18)` was *not* satisfied. This meant that after executing the pick and place sequence, the `on` predicate was not true.
           
           **Tackling the Continuous Values and Stability**
           
           I'm thinking the culprit is in the continuous values for `#o2` used in the `place` action. The object has to be in the right place, within the bounds of `v18`. I need to ensure the placement is both within the AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) of `v18` and stable. We need to be careful with the pose's `theta`, too, and make sure it's valid within the surface's boundaries. It can mean that a rotation outside the boundaries of `v18` makes supported impossible, hence the need for a precise location for the `x`, `y` and `theta`.
           
           **Addressing the `new-axiom@0(?o)` Conundrum**
           
           The other thing that keeps bothering me is the potential interference of that `new-axiom@0(?o)` axiom with `pick`. If it's *truly* blocking `pick` actions, then this task is unsolvable as long as more than one object is graspable. However, I'm going to assume, based on previous failures, that it's a red herring or that there's some implicit bypassing of that condition, and focus on the geometric issues.
           
           **Plan Refinement and Continuous Value Adjustment**
           
           To address the stability issue, I'm going to make the x,y coordinates very precise, making sure the object is well within the AABB of the target surface. I will use the table height to set the `z` of the pick. I'm choosing a pose of `(4.5, -0.4, 0.8, 0.0)` for the object placed in the center of the surface bounds.
           
           **Refined Plan and Continuous Variable Values**
           
           Here's the plan I'll try again:
           
           1.  `move_base v3 #q3 #t7`
           2.  `pick v4 v12 v13 #g1 #q3 #t5`
           3.  `move_base #q3 #o3 #o0`
           4.  `place v4 v12 #o2 #g1 #o3 #o4`
           
           I'll use the following continuous values:
           
           *   `#q3`:  `(-4.0, 0.0, 0.0)` (base pose aligned with object source)
           *   `#o3`:  `(4.5, 0.0, 0.0)` (base near the target)
           *   `#o2`:  `(4.5, -0.4, 0.8, 0.0)` (object placed at this pose)
           
           If this *still* fails, I'll need to re-evaluate whether I'm missing something fundamental about the goal or whether the geometry is more complex than I can currently account for, or if the system's checks for stability are stricter than I realized.
