(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Reachability of a Goal State**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal state where I need to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`. Specifically, I need to achieve `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`. Let's break this down. From the initial state and the provided axioms, these "on" facts are essentially shorthand for `supported` and `atpose` facts.  Right now, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are all on `v11`, i.e., `on(v8, v11)`, `on(v12, v11)`, and `on(v14, v11)`. This is because `v8` is `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`, and so on for the others.
           
           The core of the problem, as I see it, is that I need to somehow move these objects from `v11` to `v16`. This requires, at a minimum, picking them up from `v11` and placing them on `v16`.  However, when I check the available actions, I only see `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  That's a huge problem.  The crucial `pick` and `place` actions, which are absolutely essential to manipulation tasks, are simply *not* available in the action list.  This means I'm severely constrained.
           
           I'm expressly forbidden from using any actions *not* in that list. The constraint is explicit.  Therefore, I'm stuck with just moving the base, which doesn't affect the objects' positions or their support relations. It only deals with the base's configuration. This is a dead end.
           
           I dig into the details. To achieve `on(v8, v16)`, I need both `supported(v8, ?p, v16)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)`. Currently, I have `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`. There is also `supported(v8, #o2, v16)`. If `v8` could be `atpose(#o2)` then that would make `on(v8, v16)` possible. However, the available `move_base` action explicitly *cannot* change `atpose`.  I need `pick` and `place` actions, which manipulate `atpose`, and, well, they're not there.  The same argument applies to `v12` and `v14`.
           
           Since `atpose` can't be changed, `v8` will *always* be `atpose(v8, v9)`, `v12` will *always* be `atpose(v12, v13)`, and `v14` will *always* be `atpose(v14, v15)`. Therefore, for the goal to be true, the initial state *must* have  `supported(v8, v9, v16)`, `supported(v12, v13, v16)`, and `supported(v14, v15, v16)`. But, I'm looking at `supported(v8, v9, v11)`, `supported(v12, v13, v11)`, and `supported(v14, v15, v11)` which are *not* the same. This means the goal cannot be satisfied because the current `atpose` facts, in conjunction with the initial state facts, do not allow it. The available action, `move_base`, has absolutely no bearing on `supported` or `atpose`.
           
           In summary: I'm stymied. The constraints, specifically the limited action set, render the goal unreachable. I can't manipulate the objects, so I cannot achieve the desired state.  The system is broken.
