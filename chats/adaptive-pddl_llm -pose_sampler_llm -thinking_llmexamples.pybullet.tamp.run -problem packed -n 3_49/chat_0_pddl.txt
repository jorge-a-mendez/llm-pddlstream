(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 4 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to come up with 50 stable placements for object ID 4, which is essentially a square with dimensions of about 0.097 by 0.097, on surface 0, which is also a square, spanning from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.  No problem.  Since object ID 4 is new, I don't need to worry about any collision checks this time.
           
           The surface offers a bit of room to maneuver – the rotated object has to stay within the surface's bounds. I've got a good handle on how the object's effective size changes with rotation (theta). It's simplest at multiples of pi/2, just the original object's dimensions (about 0.097). I just need to consider the worst-case scenario.  When theta is pi/4, the object's effective extent (both x and y) is maximized, and this effective size can be easily computed using the square root of 2.
           
           After that, it's just a matter of defining a suitable grid within the surface boundaries, varying both theta and the (x,y) position of the object's center. I've chosen five angles (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2). For each angle, there will be ten unique placements.
           
           The placement algorithm is defined, and it seems robust. I've carefully accounted for the varying effective extents and adjusted the placement region accordingly. I've double-checked my calculations, paying close attention to the impact of rotation and the valid range for the object's center within the surface, ensuring the resulting 50 placements are valid. It's all very straightforward and optimized. The 50 placements are now ready to be delivered.

(Thoughts: **Placing Object 5: A Detailed Approach to Avoiding Collisions**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed Object 4, which is great. Now it's time for Object 5, and I need to be careful to avoid any collisions. I've got the surface dimensions, the object's dimensions, and crucially, the dimensions and precise placement of Object 4, including its rotation. My primary goal here is to generate 50 unique, stable placements for Object 5 that *don't* overlap Object 4.
           
           First, I need to understand the successful placement of Object 4. I've calculated the rotated AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of Object 4 based on its rotation angle and dimensions. This AABB gives me the exact region in which Object 4 is occupying on Surface 0, which I must avoid when considering placement of Object 5.
           
           Now for Object 5, I have to find a way to make sure it doesn't collide with the AABB of Object 4. After evaluating various options, the obvious thing to do is to try to place Object 5 around the edges of Object 4's AABB.
           
           After careful calculations, I've realized that for specific rotation angles (like pi/8, pi/4, and 3*pi/8), Object 5, even when it's just barely touching Object 4, has a wide AABB that doesn't fit within the space not occupied by Object 4, given their dimensions. The rotated AABB's for these values, when trying to fit in the four "corner" regions around Object 4, are simply too large.
           
           This means that *only* if the rotation is 0 or pi/2 (or a similar multiple of those) am I likely to find safe placements. With this, for `theta = 0` (or equivalently pi/2), I've found a good strategy: I must place Object 5 either directly to the left, below, or in the bottom-left corner of Object 4 such that its AABB's don't overlap. Since the x and y axes of Object 5 are similar, this should be valid. The main challenge comes from placing it close enough to utilize the whole space, but not too close that it is overlapping Object 4. 
           
           So, I've defined a strategy to generate a bunch of possible placements within these regions, making sure that it's safe to place Object 5 in the bottom left area. I will also be making sure that the final placements are not inside or over Object 4 to ensure there is no collision.

(Thoughts: **Planning Placements for Object 6**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown. I need to place 50 instances of Object 6, which is nearly square, on Surface 0, avoiding collisions with Object 4 and Object 5, both already placed.
           
           1.  **Understand the Surface:** Surface 0 is a 0.27 x 0.27 square centered at (0,0).
           2.  **Object 6's Dimensions:** Object 6 is about 0.09 x 0.09. I'll use `s_6 = 0.045` as half the side length for easier calculations.
           3.  **Collision Avoidance:** The key is to keep Object 6 from overlapping Objects 4 and 5. I'll use Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) to check for potential collisions. I've calculated the AABBs for Objects 4 and 5, taking into account Object 4's rotation:
           
               *   **Object 4's AABB:** Roughly `[-0.028, 0.099] x [-0.028, 0.099]`.
               *   **Object 5's AABB:** Roughly `[-0.134, -0.036] x [-0.134, -0.036]`.
           
           Now for Object 6, I need to figure out where it can safely be placed.
           
           **Calculating Placement Constraints**
           
           I'm starting by establishing the boundaries for Object 6's center. Considering that I need to place objects, I'll allow them to be arbitrarily oriented. This requires the consideration of different rotational angles for the square objects.
           
           1.  **Surface Limits:** Object 6 needs to stay within Surface 0. If Object 6 is rotated at 0 degrees, it has a max displacement of ~ 0.090 from the center to remain within the surface. So, the placement center's x and y coordinates both must stay within `[-0.090, 0.090]`.
           2.  **Collision Zones:** Object 6 can't overlap with Objects 4 or 5.  This means I need to leave a buffer zone around these existing AABBs to prevent contact. I initially considered a rotation of `pi/4`. This maximizes the dimensions, reducing usable surface area. I will instead keep the object at `theta = 0` (or 90). This makes the buffer zones simple to calculate.
           
           **Identifying Valid Placement Regions**
           
           I've determined that due to the object's square shape, the ideal rotation is `theta = 0`. With that, the valid regions are narrow strips between Object 4 and Object 5, along either axis. Specifically, these are two regions.
           
           I've mapped out these regions, and I've come up with coordinate values within those regions that are guaranteed not to overlap.
           
           I've carefully selected the number of points (25 for each strip for x, and 2 for y) to reach exactly 50 placements. I will not rotate the objects for simplicity.
           
           **Final Placement Strategy**
           
           I'll generate 50 placements for Object 6 using the strategy I've laid out. I have my final placement points in each of the two narrow strips between existing objects. The object rotation will be fixed at 0. These parameters should guarantee I can successfully generate 50 stable placements. I will then send these points.
