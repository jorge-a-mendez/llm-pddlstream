           I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for an object on a given surface. The surface is a simple square, and the object is almost square in shape. My primary concern is ensuring that the object remains *fully* within the surface boundaries, regardless of its rotation.
           
           First, I define the object and surface dimensions. Then, I recognize that the almost-square shape simplifies the problem. Regardless of the rotation angle (theta), the effective width and height of the object's bounding box will be very close. To find the safe region, I calculate the maximum effective dimension. Because the object is almost a square, the most restrictive rotation occurs at 45 degrees (pi/4 radians). Using this worst-case scenario, I determine the boundaries within which the object's center must lie to guarantee stability across all orientations. This gives a safe region that's smaller than the total area of the surface.
           
           I then choose a set of coordinate points for x and y locations within the safe region and decide to use theta values of 0 and pi/4, as it will be safe to cover the whole valid placement area. I generate a sequence of 25 placements at theta = 0, and 25 at theta = pi/4, for a total of 50. This gives me a sufficiently diverse set of placements within the safe region.

           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing a new square object (ID 4) onto a surface while avoiding collision with a previously placed square object (ID 5).  I need to figure out a set of valid locations for object 4 that are surface-compliant and collision-free.
           
           First, I analyze object 5's position: it's at a known location, and I can calculate the bounds of its square AABB. This gives me the region to avoid.
           
           Next, I look at object 4. I know its dimensions and the dimensions of the surface I need to place it on. I need to consider both rotations: the main orientation (theta=0) and a rotated one (theta=pi/4).
           
           The core of my approach is to generate candidate placements, check if each one is valid (surface bounds and no collision), and then keep the valid placements until I have 50. I calculate a rough, safe region to consider center points on the surface, keeping in mind the object's maximum dimensions when rotated.
           
           I start by creating a grid of potential (x, y) center points.  Then, for each center point, I check both rotations (0 and pi/4).  I use my collision check function, which compares the AABBs of objects 4 and 5.
           
           For each candidate, I determine the object 4 AABB using the current orientation and center point. If this AABB falls outside the surface or overlaps the object 5 AABB, it's discarded.  If the position is not in collision with object 5, it is accepted as a valid placement.
           
           In detail, I had to ensure that surface boundaries were maintained across both rotations.
           Then, I used an overlap check to detect collisions: if any parts of the objects are within an overlap of their AABBs, then they are considered to be colliding.
           
           For each of the grid points, I determined their rotation. This gave me the total valid placements.
           I'll then be able to determine which placements avoid collisions while remaining inside the specified surface.

(Thoughts: **My Placement Strategy for Object ID 6**
           
           I'm tackling the task of finding 50 stable placements for a near-square object (ID 6) on a defined surface (surface 0). This surface is a simple bounding box. The challenge lies in avoiding two previously placed objects (IDs 4 and 5) that now act as fixed obstacles.
           
           First, I established the surface's boundaries. Then, I meticulously calculated the bounding boxes (AABBs) for both obstacle objects (4 and 5) based on their placement coordinates and extents.  I have these stored as `O4_bbox` and `O5_bbox`.
           
           My approach is systematic: I'll generate potential placement points and then filter those that collide with the obstacles. I'm focusing on two key rotations: 0 degrees and 45 degrees (`pi/4` radians). I chose these rotations because the object is nearly square, and these two angles cover the extremes of its footprint.
           
           To generate candidates, I'm using a grid-based approach. The surface is about 0.27 x 0.27 units.  I will use grid of centers covering the range [-0.06, 0.06] and the interval will have a step size of 0.02. I did the math to ensure the object, even when rotated, stays within the surface boundaries.
           
           I've defined a helper function `get_bbox` to accurately calculate the bounding box for object 6 based on its center and rotation. Then, the `is_collision` function efficiently determines if any two bounding boxes overlap.
           
           My plan is to iterate through each rotation (0 and `pi/4`), and for each rotation, iterate through the center points of my grid. For each potential placement, I'll calculate its bounding box, check for surface containment, and use `is_collision` to ensure it doesn't collide with `O4` or `O5`.  I'll stop when I have 50 valid placements.
