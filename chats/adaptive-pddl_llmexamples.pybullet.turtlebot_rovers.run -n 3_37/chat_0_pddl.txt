           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, both equipped with a camera `v10` that supports mode `v11`, and both having a storage `v16`. There are several rocks: `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`, some of type `v2` (stone) and others of type `v6` (soil). There's also a lander `v9`. The rovers are at specific configurations (`v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14`) and can potentially move to the same configurations. They also share a configuration `#o5` where they are above all the rocks, and a configuration `#o3` where they can image objectives `v17`, `v18`, `v19`. They can communicate with the lander `v9` from configuration `#o0`. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires both rovers `v12` and `v14` to be at some configuration, to have a free store `v16`, and to have received images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19` in mode `v11`, and received analysis of a rock of type `v2` and a rock of type `v6`.
           
           Let's break down the goal:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This requires taking images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19` with camera `v10` in mode `v11` and sending them to the lander.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means we need to find a rock of type `v2`, sample it, and send the analysis. Rocks of type `v2` are `v1`, `v3`, `v4`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means we need to find a rock of type `v6`, sample it, and send the analysis. Rocks of type `v6` are `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           
           The available actions are very limited: only two `move` actions and two `drop_rock` actions. None of these actions can achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates directly. The `move` actions simply move the rovers to their current positions, which doesn't change their state in a way that helps with the goal. The `drop_rock` actions would only be useful if we had previously sampled a rock and the store was full, which is not the case as the stores are free.
           
           Given that there are no `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` actions in the provided list of valid action instances, it is impossible to achieve the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` parts of the goal. These predicates require actions that are not allowed.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the given set of allowed actions.
