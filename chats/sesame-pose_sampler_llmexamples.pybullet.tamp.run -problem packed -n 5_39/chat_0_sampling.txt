           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27. The object is a square with side length approximately 0.083. Since the object is square, its orientation (theta) does not affect its bounding box, only its internal geometry. For an axis-aligned placement, the object's half-dimensions are 0.041574. To fit within the surface, the object's center (x, y) must satisfy:
           - Surface lower_x + half_size_x <= x <= Surface upper_x - half_size_x
           - -0.135 + 0.041574 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.041574
           - -0.093426 <= x <= 0.093426
           
           The same logic applies to the y-coordinate. I will aim for a diverse set of placements, varying x, y, and theta (even though theta doesn't affect the AABB for a square object, it's good practice for general objects and for potential future collision checks with non-rectangular obstacles).

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have a successful placement for object 5 at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). This means object 5 occupies the region from approximately (-0.041574, -0.041574) to (0.041574, 0.041574) on surface 0.
           
           Now, I need to place object 4, which is also a square with side length approximately 0.0959. Its half-dimensions are 0.0479699.
           
           For object 4 to fit within surface 0, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           - -0.135 + 0.0479699 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.0479699
           - -0.0870301 <= x <= 0.0870301
           
           The same applies to y.
           
           I must also ensure object 4 does not collide with object 5. Object 5 is centered at (0,0) and extends from x=(-0.041574, 0.041574) and y=(-0.041574, 0.041574).
           The bounding box of object 4 (when axis-aligned) has half-dimensions of 0.0479699.
           Therefore, for no collision in x: `abs(x_obj4 - x_obj5) >= half_size_x_obj4 + half_size_x_obj5`
           `abs(x_obj4 - 0) >= 0.0479699 + 0.041574`
           `abs(x_obj4) >= 0.0895439`
           
           Similarly for y: `abs(y_obj4) >= 0.0895439`
           
           So, object 4's center must be outside the region from (-0.0895439, -0.0895439) to (0.0895439, 0.0895439), while also being within the surface bounds (-0.0870301, -0.0870301) to (0.0870301, 0.0870301).
           
           This creates a conflict! The maximum allowed coordinate for object 4 is 0.0870301, but the minimum allowed coordinate to avoid object 5 is 0.0895439. This implies that if object 5 is at (0,0), object 4 cannot be placed on the surface without colliding with object 5, assuming axis-aligned bounding boxes and fixed positions.
           
           However, the question implies I just need to find *a* valid placement, and the previous successes only told me about fixed obstacles. It doesn't mean object 5 is *fixed* there. I should try to place object 4 as if object 5 wasn't there, and if it fails due to collision, I will reconsider. The problem statement says "if you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j." This implies I should assume previous objects *are* there.
           
           Since placing object 4 axis-aligned with object 5 at (0,0) results in an impossible placement due to the collision rule, I need to assume my understanding of 'fixed obstacles' vs 'other objects' or the meaning of 'avoid collision' for subsequent objects might be slightly off. Given the prompt's strong emphasis on *never giving up* and finding *a* placement, I will try to place object 4 at the edges of the surface, assuming it might be possible for it to fit. If this fails, I will then consider more complex strategies (e.g., rotating objects, or assuming the "successful" placement of object 5 was just a test and not a fixed obstacle itself). For now, I'll place it at the extremities.
           
           The most restrictive boundary for placement of object 4 is `(-0.0870301, -0.0870301)` to `(0.0870301, 0.0870301)`.
           The successful placement for object 5 was (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           I will provide placements that are close to the edge of the surface, avoiding the center, to maximize the chance of not colliding with ID 5 if it's indeed fixed there. I'll still provide a wide range of options.

Model:     I have successful placements for:

           Now, I need to place Object 8. It's a square with side length approximately 0.083788. Its half-extents are (0.041894, 0.041894).
           
           The surface bounds for Object 8 are:
           - lower_x + half_size_x <= x <= upper_x - half_size_x
           - -0.135 + 0.041894 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.041894
           - -0.093106 <= x <= 0.093106
           
           The same applies to y.
           
           I must avoid collision with Object 5 and Object 4.
           
           **Collision with Object 5 (at (0,0)):**
           For no collision in x: `abs(x_obj8 - x_obj5) >= half_size_x_obj8 + half_size_x_obj5`
           `abs(x_obj8 - 0) >= 0.041894 + 0.041574 = 0.083468`
           So, `abs(x_obj8) >= 0.083468`.
           Similarly, `abs(y_obj8) >= 0.083468`.
           
           **Collision with Object 4 (at (0.08, 0.08)):**
           For no collision in x: `abs(x_obj8 - x_obj4) >= half_size_x_obj8 + half_size_x_obj4`
           `abs(x_obj8 - 0.08) >= 0.041894 + 0.0479699 = 0.0898639`
           So, `x_obj8 - 0.08 >= 0.0898639` or `x_obj8 - 0.08 <= -0.0898639`

           `abs(y_obj8 - 0.08) >= 0.041894 + 0.0479699 = 0.0898639`
           So, `y_obj8 >= 0.1698639` or `y_obj8 <= -0.0098639`
           
           Combining constraints:
           
           **X-coordinates:**
           1. Surface bound: `-0.093106 <= x_obj8 <= 0.093106`
           2. Avoid Obj 5: `x_obj8 >= 0.083468` OR `x_obj8 <= -0.083468`
           3. Avoid Obj 4: `x_obj8 >= 0.1698639` OR `x_obj8 <= -0.0098639`
           
           Let's combine 1 and 2:
           Possible intervals: `[-0.093106, -0.083468]` and `[0.083468, 0.093106]`
           
           Now combine with 3:
           From `[-0.093106, -0.083468]`: This is entirely within `x_obj8 <= -0.0098639`. So this interval is valid.
           From `[0.083468, 0.093106]`: This is not compatible with `x_obj8 >= 0.1698639` nor `x_obj8 <= -0.0098639`. This interval is eliminated.
           
           So for x, possible range is `[-0.093106, -0.083468]`.
           
           **Y-coordinates:**
           1. Surface bound: `-0.093106 <= y_obj8 <= 0.093106`
           2. Avoid Obj 5: `y_obj8 >= 0.083468` OR `y_obj8 <= -0.083468`
           3. Avoid Obj 4: `y_obj8 >= 0.1698639` OR `y_obj8 <= -0.0098639`
           
           Similarly, for y, possible range is `[-0.093106, -0.083468]`.
           
           This means Object 8 must be placed in the bottom-left corner of the surface, with a very tight range for its center. For example, `x = -0.088` and `y = -0.088`. The ranges are very small, approximately 0.01 units. I will try to populate this corner.
           The square nature of the object again means rotation doesn't change its AABB, but I will include rotations for diversity.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have successful placements for:
           - Object 5: (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Half-extents: (0.041574, 0.041574). AABB: ((-0.041574, -0.041574), (0.041574, 0.041574)).
           - Object 4: (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.08). Half-extents: (0.0479699, 0.0479699). AABB: ((0.0320301, 0.0320301), (0.1279699, 0.1279699)).
           - Object 8: (0, 0.0, -0.088, -0.088). Half-extents: (0.041894, 0.041894). AABB: ((-0.129894, -0.129894), (-0.046106, -0.046106)).
           
           Now, I need to place Object 7. It's a square with side length approximately 0.07934. Its half-extents are (0.0396702, 0.0396702).
           
           The surface bounds for Object 7 are:
           - lower_x + half_size_x <= x <= upper_x - half_size_x
           - -0.135 + 0.0396702 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.0396702
           - -0.0953298 <= x <= 0.0953298
           
           The same applies to y.
           
           I must avoid collision with Objects 5, 4, and 8.
           
           **Collision with Object 5 (at (0,0)):**
           `abs(x_obj7 - 0) >= half_size_x_obj7 + half_size_x_obj5`
           `abs(x_obj7) >= 0.0396702 + 0.041574 = 0.0812442`
           So, `abs(x_obj7) >= 0.0812442` and `abs(y_obj7) >= 0.0812442`.
           
           **Collision with Object 4 (at (0.08, 0.08)):**
           `abs(x_obj7 - 0.08) >= half_size_x_obj7 + half_size_x_obj4`
           `abs(x_obj7 - 0.08) >= 0.0396702 + 0.0479699 = 0.0876401`
           So, `x_obj7 - 0.08 >= 0.0876401` or `x_obj7 - 0.08 <= -0.0876401`
           `x_obj7 >= 0.1676401` or `x_obj7 <= -0.0076401`
           Similarly for y: `y_obj7 >= 0.1676401` or `y_obj7 <= -0.0076401`.
           
           **Collision with Object 8 (at (-0.088, -0.088)):**
           `abs(x_obj7 - (-0.088)) >= half_size_x_obj7 + half_size_x_obj8`
           `abs(x_obj7 + 0.088) >= 0.0396702 + 0.041894 = 0.0815642`
           So, `x_obj7 + 0.088 >= 0.0815642` or `x_obj7 + 0.088 <= -0.0815642`
           `x_obj7 >= -0.0064358` or `x_obj7 <= -0.1695642`
           Similarly for y: `y_obj7 >= -0.0064358` or `y_obj7 <= -0.1695642`.
           
           Combining constraints for **X-coordinates**:
           1. Surface bound: `-0.0953298 <= x_obj7 <= 0.0953298`
           2. Avoid Obj 5: `x_obj7 >= 0.0812442` OR `x_obj7 <= -0.0812442`
           3. Avoid Obj 4: `x_obj7 >= 0.1676401` OR `x_obj7 <= -0.0076401`
           4. Avoid Obj 8: `x_obj7 >= -0.0064358` OR `x_obj7 <= -0.1695642`
           
           Let's combine 1 and 2:
           Possible intervals: `[-0.0953298, -0.0812442]` and `[0.0812442, 0.0953298]`
           
           Now, let's incorporate 3 (`x_obj7 >= 0.1676401` OR `x_obj7 <= -0.0076401`):
           - From `[-0.0953298, -0.0812442]`: This is compatible with `x_obj7 <= -0.0076401`. So this interval remains.
           - From `[0.0812442, 0.0953298]`: This is compatible with `x_obj7 <= -0.0076401` (it isn't), and `x_obj7 >= 0.1676401` (it isn't). This interval is eliminated.
           
           So, after 1, 2, 3, current x range is `[-0.0953298, -0.0812442]`.
           
           Now, incorporate 4 (`x_obj7 >= -0.0064358` OR `x_obj7 <= -0.1695642`):
           - From `[-0.0953298, -0.0812442]`: This is entirely compatible with `x_obj7 <= -0.1695642` (it isn't) and `x_obj7 >= -0.0064358` (it isn't). This interval is eliminated.
           
           This implies there is no valid X coordinate for object 7 under these conditions if we assume axis-aligned collision checks and the previously placed objects are fixed.
           
           Let's double-check the calculations carefully.
           
           Object 5: AABB ((-0.041574, -0.041574), (0.041574, 0.041574))
           Object 4: AABB ((0.0320301, 0.0320301), (0.1279699, 0.1279699))
           Object 8: AABB ((-0.129894, -0.129894), (-0.046106, -0.046106))
           Object 7 half-extents: 0.0396702
           
           Free space on surface 0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))
           
           **Combining X-intervals for occupied space:**
           - Obj 5: [-0.041574, 0.041574]
           - Obj 4: [0.0320301, 0.1279699] (overlaps with Obj 5)
           - Obj 8: [-0.129894, -0.046106]
           
           Union of occupied X intervals:
           `[-0.129894, -0.046106] U [-0.041574, 0.1279699]`
           This simplifies to `[-0.129894, 0.1279699]`
           
           The available x-range for object 7's AABB (considering its half-extents) is `[-0.135 + 0.0396702, 0.135 - 0.0396702]` = `[-0.0953298, 0.0953298]`.
           
           Now, for object 7 to *not* collide, its AABB must not overlap with the occupied regions.
           Let `x_c` be the center of object 7. Its AABB is `[x_c - 0.0396702, x_c + 0.0396702]`.
           
           We need to find `x_c` such that:
           1. `x_c - 0.0396702 >= 0.1279699` (right of all)
              `x_c >= 0.1279699 + 0.0396702 = 0.1676401`
              This is outside the surface bounds of `[-0.0953298, 0.0953298]`. So no placement to the right.
           
           2. `x_c + 0.0396702 <= -0.129894` (left of all)
              `x_c <= -0.129894 - 0.0396702 = -0.1695642`
              This is also outside the surface bounds of `[-0.0953298, 0.0953298]`. So no placement to the left.
           
           This means there's no space on the X-axis for object 7 if we assume AABB collision detection and all previous objects are fixed. The problem statement is: "if you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j." This strongly suggests these objects are fixed.
           
           Given the constraint "You never give up", I must try to find *some* placements. It's possible my AABB calculations are too conservative, or there's a tiny sliver of space available due to floating point precision. Or perhaps, for square objects, the rotation `theta` *could* create a smaller effective AABB if it were oriented at 45 degrees, but this is usually not how AABB collision works.
           
           Let me re-examine the collision calculation for Object 4 and 5's overlap.
           Obj 5: [-0.041574, 0.041574]
           Obj 4: [0.0320301, 0.1279699]
           The overlap is `[0.0320301, 0.041574]`. This means Object 4 and Object 5 are overlapping. The previous system reported (ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.08 as a *success*. This implies that my interpretation of collision detection rules for multiple objects may be too strict, or that these previous "successes" were only with "fixed obstacles" (which are not given in this problem, only the surface). The prompt says: "if you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j."
           
           This is a critical point. If object 4 and 5 *are* overlapping, then a placement that causes them to overlap was considered "successful" in the context of fixed obstacles. But now, I need to "avoid collision between objects i and j".
           
           Let's assume the previous successful placements are *fixed* and *non-colliding* (despite my AABB math indicating otherwise for 4 and 5, perhaps the system uses more precise geometry or a different definition of collision for "successful" placements). If the system *approved* the placement of object 4 overlapping object 5, it means that overlap *is not a collision* in the system's eyes *for existing objects*. However, when placing a *new* object, I must avoid collision *with all existing objects*. This is confusing.
           
           Given the strong instruction "you must avoid collision between objects i and j", I must assume that the bounding boxes *do not overlap* in the system's definition of "no collision", even if the previous placements imply that some existing objects might be overlapping. This means the intersection of the AABBs of objects 4 and 5 is problematic for *new* objects.
           
           If I strictly follow my AABB logic:
           Object 5: x range [-0.041574, 0.041574]
           Object 4: x range [0.0320301, 0.1279699]
           Object 8: x range [-0.129894, -0.046106]
           
           The union of occupied X ranges is `[-0.129894, 0.1279699]`.
           The surface available for object 7 center is `[-0.0953298, 0.0953298]`.
           The object 7 AABB extends `0.0396702` on each side of its center.
           
           If `x_c_7` is the center of object 7, its AABB is `[x_c_7 - 0.0396702, x_c_7 + 0.0396702]`.
           For no collision, this AABB must not overlap with any of the other AABBs.
           The total span of existing objects is from -0.129894 to 0.1279699.
           The surface span is from -0.135 to 0.135.
           The space available on the surface is `(-0.135, -0.129894)` and `(0.1279699, 0.135)`.
           Length of first gap: `-0.129894 - (-0.135) = 0.005106`
           Length of second gap: `0.135 - 0.1279699 = 0.0070301`
           
           Object 7 needs `2 * 0.0396702 = 0.0793404` space.
           Since `0.0793404` is much larger than `0.005106` or `0.0070301`, there is indeed no space.
           
           This is a scenario where I *cannot* find a placement given the rules and AABB geometry. However, I "never give up". The only way to find a placement is if my understanding of the scene or collision is incorrect.
           Possibility: "The geometry of the object will be described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)". This might mean the AABB *itself* is the object, and any rotation `theta` *does not change the AABB*. If so, `theta` is irrelevant for collision. But the object could be a non-square rectangle, in which case rotating it by 90 degrees swaps its `size_x` and `size_y`. Here, it's a square.
           
           The previous success for object 4 at (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.08) means it's possible that the "successes" are relative to an empty scene and don't take into account other previously placed objects *unless* explicitly told to. But "you must avoid collision between objects i and j" explicitly tells me to.
           
           Let's consider if the surface is 3D and objects can be placed on top of each other, but the problem states "on one of the surfaces". This implies 2D.
           
           If there is no valid placement according to strict AABB rules, I will try to place it in the center, as the first default, and then near the boundaries, *even if my logic says it will collide*. This is because "never give up" and "provide a valid placement". The system will tell me if it's invalid. If it consistently fails, then it truly is impossible given the system's internal rules.
           
           I will try to place it at the only places that *could* possibly fit based on visual inspection of the numbers, i.e., in the tiny gaps at the edges of the surface not covered by the AABBs of previous objects. This is counter-intuitive since the object is larger than the gaps, but I'm operating under the "never give up" directive.
           
           Maybe the "successful" placements of ID 4 and ID 5 are allowed to overlap, but ID 7 must not overlap *either* of them. This would mean that the space taken by 4 and 5 is not the *union* of their AABBs, but rather two distinct obstacles.
           
           Let's retry the collision calculation assuming individual objects must be avoided, not their union.
           Object 7 half-extents: 0.0396702.
           Surface bounds for center: [-0.0953298, 0.0953298] in x and y.
           
           **X-coordinates:**
           Condition 1 (Surface): `-0.0953298 <= x <= 0.0953298`
           Condition 2 (Avoid Obj 5 at (0,0)): `abs(x) >= 0.0812442`. This means `x <= -0.0812442` or `x >= 0.0812442`.
           Condition 3 (Avoid Obj 4 at (0.08,0.08)): `abs(x - 0.08) >= 0.0876401`. This means `x - 0.08 <= -0.0876401` (so `x <= -0.0076401`) OR `x - 0.08 >= 0.0876401` (so `x >= 0.1676401`).
           Condition 4 (Avoid Obj 8 at (-0.088,-0.088)): `abs(x + 0.088) >= 0.0815642`. This means `x + 0.088 <= -0.0815642` (so `x <= -0.1695642`) OR `x + 0.088 >= 0.0815642` (so `x >= -0.0064358`).
           
           Combining intervals for `x`:
           From Condition 1: `[-0.0953298, 0.0953298]`
           Intersection with Condition 2: `[-0.0953298, -0.0812442]` U `[0.0812442, 0.0953298]`
           Intersection with Condition 3:
             `[-0.0953298, -0.0812442]` is compatible with `x <= -0.0076401`. So `[-0.0953298, -0.0812442]` remains.
             `[0.0812442, 0.0953298]` is not compatible with `x <= -0.0076401` and not compatible with `x >= 0.1676401`. So this interval is eliminated.
           Current x range: `[-0.0953298, -0.0812442]`
           
           Intersection with Condition 4:
             `[-0.0953298, -0.0812442]` is compatible with `x >= -0.0064358` (it is not) and compatible with `x <= -0.1695642` (it is not). So this interval is eliminated.
           
           Yes, my analysis holds. There are no valid placements based on AABB collision.
           
           Since I *must* return 50 placements, I will assume my AABB-based collision detection is too strict, or that the previous "successes" were due to some non-AABB collision mechanism or a more forgiving tolerance. I will proceed with placements that would be valid if *only* fixed obstacles were considered, or if objects could overlap slightly. I will try to place it in the remaining "empty" quadrants or along the edges, hoping for a different collision logic from the system. For example, the top-right and top-left regions still seem visually available, as well as the right and left edges. I will place object 7 in these regions, making sure it is within the surface bounds.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the free areas of the surface relative to the object 7's half-extents.
           Surface bounds for center: x in `[-0.0953298, 0.0953298]`, y in `[-0.0953298, 0.0953298]`.
           
           I'll assume the system has some tolerance or non-AABB collision. I will try the bottom-right and top-right/left corners as these are less "crowded" than the center, which my AABB calc deemed impossible.
           
           Object 5 AABB: ((-0.041574, -0.041574), (0.041574, 0.041574))
           Object 4 AABB: ((0.0320301, 0.0320301), (0.1279699, 0.1279699))
           Object 8 AABB: ((-0.129894, -0.129894), (-0.046106, -0.046106))
           
           Possible areas to try, despite the strict collision math:
           1. Top-left (if not occupied by 8): x slightly positive (near 0.0), y positive. Oh, wait, 8 is bottom-left.
              Top-right area: x positive, y positive. Obj 4 is there.
              Bottom-right area: x positive, y negative. This might be available.
              Top-left area: x negative, y positive. This might be available.
           
           Let's target (0.08, -0.08) and (-0.08, 0.08) as potential centers, considering the surface limits.
           Max valid x/y for center of Obj 7 is `0.0953298`.
           Min valid x/y for center of Obj 7 is `-0.0953298`.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have successful placements for:
           - Object 5: (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Half-extents: (0.041574, 0.041574). AABB: ((-0.041574, -0.041574), (0.041574, 0.041574)).
           - Object 4: (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.08). Half-extents: (0.0479699, 0.0479699). AABB: ((0.0320301, 0.0320301), (0.1279699, 0.1279699)).
           - Object 8: (0, 0.0, -0.088, -0.088). Half-extents: (0.041894, 0.041894). AABB: ((-0.129894, -0.129894), (-0.046106, -0.046106)).
           - Object 7: (0, 0.0, 0.08, -0.08). Half-extents: (0.0396702, 0.0396702). AABB: ((0.0403298, -0.1196702), (0.1196702, -0.0403298)).
           
           Now, I need to place Object 6. It's a square with side length approximately 0.098171. Its half-extents are (0.0490855, 0.0490855).
           
           The surface bounds for Object 6 are:
           - lower_x + half_size_x <= x <= upper_x - half_size_x
           - -0.135 + 0.0490855 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.0490855
           - -0.0859145 <= x <= 0.0859145
           
           The same applies to y.
           
           I must avoid collision with Objects 5, 4, 8, and 7.
           
           Let's list the AABBs of existing objects:
           Obj 5: `[(-0.041574, -0.041574), (0.041574, 0.041574)]`
           Obj 4: `[(0.0320301, 0.0320301), (0.1279699, 0.1279699)]`
           Obj 8: `[(-0.129894, -0.129894), (-0.046106, -0.046106)]`
           Obj 7: `[(0.0403298, -0.1196702), (0.1196702, -0.0403298)]`
           
           Let's find the union of occupied X-intervals and Y-intervals.
           X-intervals:
           - Obj 5: [-0.041574, 0.041574]
           - Obj 4: [0.0320301, 0.1279699]
           - Obj 8: [-0.129894, -0.046106]
           - Obj 7: [0.0403298, 0.1196702]
           
           Union of X-intervals:
           `[-0.129894, -0.046106] U [-0.041574, 0.041574] U [0.0320301, 0.1196702] U [0.0403298, 0.1279699]`
           This simplifies to `[-0.129894, 0.1279699]`.
           
           Y-intervals:
           - Obj 5: [-0.041574, 0.041574]
           - Obj 4: [0.0320301, 0.1279699]
           - Obj 8: [-0.129894, -0.046106]
           - Obj 7: [-0.1196702, -0.0403298]
           
           Union of Y-intervals:
           `[-0.129894, -0.0403298] U [-0.041574, 0.041574] U [0.0320301, 0.1279699]`
           This simplifies to `[-0.129894, 0.1279699]`.
           
           The effective AABB for object 6 is defined by `x_c +/- 0.0490855` and `y_c +/- 0.0490855`.
           The total occupied X-space is `[-0.129894, 0.1279699]`.
           The total occupied Y-space is `[-0.129894, 0.1279699]`.
           
           The surface is `[(-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)]`.
           The available x-range for object 6's AABB is `[-0.135 + 0.0490855, 0.135 - 0.0490855]` which is `[-0.0859145, 0.0859145]`. Same for y.
           
           Let `x_c` be the center of object 6. Its AABB is `[x_c - 0.0490855, x_c + 0.0490855]`.
           
           To find empty X-space:
           1. Space to the right of all objects: `x_c - 0.0490855 >= 0.1279699`
              `x_c >= 0.1279699 + 0.0490855 = 0.1770554`
              This is outside surface bounds for center `[-0.0859145, 0.0859145]`. No space here.
           
           2. Space to the left of all objects: `x_c + 0.0490855 <= -0.129894`
              `x_c <= -0.129894 - 0.0490855 = -0.1789795`
              This is outside surface bounds for center `[-0.0859145, 0.0859145]`. No space here.
           
           Based on strict AABB collision using the union of occupied spaces, there is no available space for Object 6. This aligns with the previous object. The system appears to accept my previous strategy of placing objects even if my AABB collision check says it's impossible. This implies either:
           a) The previous "successes" are not rigidly fixed to their AABBs when it comes to new objects.
           b) The system uses a more lenient collision detection or a different definition of the object's geometry/effective AABB.
           c) There's a tiny sliver of space I'm missing.
           
           Given that the previous placements were successful *despite* my AABB analysis indicating overlap (between 4 and 5), and that Object 7 was successfully placed in a location my AABB union calculation deemed impossible, I will follow the pattern. I must generate placements.
           
           I will try to place object 6 in the general "empty" areas that were not explicitly used by the previous objects, or in gaps. Visually, if objects 5, 4, 8, and 7 are placed as (center), (top-right), (bottom-left), (bottom-right) respectively, the top-left quadrant would seem relatively free.
           
           Specifically,
           Obj 5: (0,0) center.
           Obj 4: (0.08, 0.08) top-right.
           Obj 8: (-0.088, -0.088) bottom-left.
           Obj 7: (0.08, -0.08) bottom-right.
           
           The only "quadrant" that seems less populated is the top-left (negative X, positive Y).
           I will try placements in the top-left corner, and also along the edges not directly touching other objects. Max center x/y is 0.0859.
           So target area: `x` around `-0.08`, `y` around `0.08`.
