           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27. The object is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.088 x 0.088. This means the object is significantly smaller than the surface, allowing for many possible stable placements.
           
           I will prioritize placing the object near the center of the surface, as this is often a good starting point for stability. I will also explore different orientations (0 and pi/2 radians) to cover rotational possibilities, although for a square object and a square surface, the orientation doesn't affect the bounding box footprint. I will then expand to other parts of the surface, ensuring the object's entire footprint remains within the surface boundaries.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I now have information about a previously placed object (ID 5) which is at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) with dimensions 0.08844138656285437 x 0.08844138656285438. The new object (ID 4) has dimensions 0.09632173741400568 x 0.09632173741400574. Both objects are square and the surface is also square.
           
           I need to find a stable placement for object 4 on surface 0, ensuring it does not collide with object 5. Object 5 is centered at the origin. Since object 4 is also roughly centered at the origin, I will need to place it such that its bounding box does not overlap with the bounding box of object 5.
           
           The half-extents of object 5 are approximately 0.04422.
           The half-extents of object 4 are approximately 0.04816.
           
           Since object 5 is at (0,0,0,0), its AABB is from (-0.04422, -0.04422) to (0.04422, 0.04422).
           To avoid collision, the center of object 4 (x,y) must satisfy |x| > (0.04422 + 0.04816) = 0.09238 or |y| > (0.04422 + 0.04816) = 0.09238.
           
           The surface extends from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           The maximum x or y coordinate for the center of object 4, keeping it on the surface, would be 0.135 - 0.04816 = 0.08684.
           Since 0.08684 < 0.09238, it is impossible to place object 4 directly adjacent to object 5 along a single axis without overlap.
           
           This means that for the objects to not overlap, they must be placed such that their corners are further apart. This also means that I was probably overthinking the bounding box collision for non-axis aligned objects, but since both are square, I will assume axis aligned bounding boxes. I will try placing object 4 along the edges of the surface, as far from the center as possible, but still within the surface bounds, to maximize the distance from object 5.
           
           I will try to place object 4 near the corners or edges of the surface, as far away from (0,0) as possible while remaining on surface 0.
           The maximum x or y for the center of object 4 is 0.135 - (0.09632173741400568 / 2) = 0.135 - 0.04816 = 0.08684.
           
           So, I'll target center coordinates around +/- 0.08, which should be sufficient to avoid collision with the object at (0,0).

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I now have information about two previously placed objects:
           Object 5 (ID 5): at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), dimensions 0.08844138656285437 x 0.08844138656285438. Half-extents approx 0.04422.
           Object 4 (ID 4): at (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0), dimensions 0.09632173741400568 x 0.09632173741400574. Half-extents approx 0.04816.
           
           The new object (ID 6) has dimensions 0.09042224536465249 x 0.09042224536465249. Half-extents approx 0.04521.
           All objects are square and the surface is square.
           
           Surface 0 extends from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           Collision avoidance:
           1. Object 6 vs Object 5 (at (0,0)):
              - AABB of Object 5: (-0.04422, -0.04422) to (0.04422, 0.04422)
              - To avoid collision, the center (x,y) of Object 6 must satisfy |x| > (0.04422 + 0.04521) = 0.08943 or |y| > (0.04422 + 0.04521) = 0.08943.
           
           2. Object 6 vs Object 4 (at (0.08, 0.0)):
              - AABB of Object 4: (0.08 - 0.04816, 0.0 - 0.04816) to (0.08 + 0.04816, 0.0 + 0.04816)
              - i.e., (0.03184, -0.04816) to (0.12816, 0.04816)
              - To avoid collision, the center (x,y) of Object 6 must satisfy:
                - x < 0.08 - (0.04816 + 0.04521) = 0.08 - 0.09337 = -0.01337 OR
                - x > 0.08 + (0.04816 + 0.04521) = 0.08 + 0.09337 = 0.17337 (outside surface) OR
                - y < 0.0 - (0.04816 + 0.04521) = -0.09337 OR
                - y > 0.0 + (0.04816 + 0.04521) = 0.09337
           
           Combined constraints:
           From (1), Object 6 needs to be away from (0,0) by at least ~0.09 on an axis.
           From (2), Object 6 needs to be away from (0.08,0) by at least ~0.093 on an axis.
           
           The max allowed center coordinate for object 6 is 0.135 - 0.04521 = 0.08979.
           
           This means that a placement at (0,0) is definitely out. A placement at (0.08, 0.0) is also out.
           Let's try placing object 6 on the opposite side of the surface from object 4, i.e., in the negative X direction, or in the Y directions.
           
           A center at (-0.08, 0.0) should work for both.
           (-0.08, 0.0) vs Object 5 (0,0): X-distance is 0.08. Need > 0.08943. This will cause collision with Object 5. My initial assessment was incorrect because the sum of half-extents is larger than the distance between centers.
           
           Let's re-evaluate.
           The center of Object 6 (x6, y6) and Object 5 (x5, y5).
           Collision if |x6 - x5| < (half_extent_x6 + half_extent_x5) AND |y6 - y5| < (half_extent_y6 + half_extent_y5).
           
           Object 5: center (0,0), half-extents (0.04422, 0.04422)
           Object 4: center (0.08,0), half-extents (0.04816, 0.04816)
           Object 6: half-extents (0.04521, 0.04521)
           
           To avoid collision with Object 5:
           |x6| >= 0.04422 + 0.04521 = 0.08943 OR |y6| >= 0.04422 + 0.04521 = 0.08943.
           
           To avoid collision with Object 4:
           |x6 - 0.08| >= 0.04816 + 0.04521 = 0.09337 OR |y6 - 0| >= 0.04816 + 0.04521 = 0.09337.
           
           Maximum center coordinate for Object 6 on surface: 0.135 - 0.04521 = 0.08979.
           
           Let's try a placement along the negative X axis, as far as possible: (-0.08979, 0.0).
           Check with Object 5: |-0.08979 - 0| = 0.08979. This is >= 0.08943. No collision on X. Y-axis is 0 for both, so this is a collision. So I need to place it such that either X or Y condition is met *for each* already placed object.
           
           This is tricky.
           Let's try placing object 6 in a corner. For example, (0.08979, 0.08979).
           Check with Object 5 (0,0):
           |0.08979 - 0| = 0.08979. This is >= 0.08943.
           |0.08979 - 0| = 0.08979. This is >= 0.08943.
           Since both X and Y conditions are met, it will not collide with Object 5.
           
           Check with Object 4 (0.08,0):
           |0.08979 - 0.08| = 0.00979. This is < 0.09337.
           |0.08979 - 0| = 0.08979. This is < 0.09337.
           This will collide with Object 4 because neither the X nor the Y condition for collision avoidance is met.
           
           Okay, I need to place Object 6 further away.
           Let's try placing Object 6 at (-0.08, -0.08).
           Check with Object 5 (0,0):
           |-0.08 - 0| = 0.08. < 0.08943. Collides on X if Y also collides.
           |-0.08 - 0| = 0.08. < 0.08943. Collides on Y if X also collides.
           This would collide with Object 5.
           
           My calculation of required distance is correct. The sum of half-extents for square objects of sizes s1 and s2 is (s1/2 + s2/2). So, to avoid overlap, the centers must be separated by at least (s1/2 + s2/2) along at least one axis.
           
           For Object 6 (s=0.09042) and Object 5 (s=0.08844): sum of half-extents = 0.04521 + 0.04422 = 0.08943.
           For Object 6 (s=0.09042) and Object 4 (s=0.09632): sum of half-extents = 0.04521 + 0.04816 = 0.09337.
           
           Max possible center for Object 6 (x,y): 0.135 - 0.04521 = 0.08979.
           
           Let's try to place it such that one of its axes is clear from both objects.
           If y6 = 0:
             |x6| >= 0.08943 (to avoid Object 5)
             |x6 - 0.08| >= 0.09337 (to avoid Object 4)
           This means x6 must be greater than or equal to 0.08943. Also, x6 must be such that (x6 - 0.08) is greater than or equal to 0.09337 or less than or equal to -0.09337.
           If x6 >= 0.08943, then x6 - 0.08 >= 0.00943. This is < 0.09337, so it will collide with Object 4.
           This means no placement along the x-axis is possible with y=0 without collision.
           
           Let's try y6 > 0.09337 (to avoid Object 4).
           The maximum y6 can be is 0.08979. This is less than 0.09337, so I cannot place Object 6 above or below Object 4.
           
           This implies there is no space for Object 6. Let me re-check the surface limits.
           Surface 0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). Length = 0.27.
           Object 6 size: 0.09042.
           
           The object is approximately 1/3 of the surface length.
           Object 5 is at (0,0). AABB: (-0.04422, -0.04422) to (0.04422, 0.04422).
           Object 4 is at (0.08, 0). AABB: (0.03184, -0.04816) to (0.12816, 0.04816).
           
           Space along x-axis for object 6:
           To the left of Object 5: max x coordinate is -(0.04422 + 0.04521) = -0.08943. But then left edge of Object 6 is -0.08943 - 0.04521 = -0.13464. This is within surface bound.
           So, if I place object 6 at (-0.08943, 0), it will collide with Object 5 on Y, and still needs to avoid Object 4.
           The AABB of Object 6 would be (-0.08943 - 0.04521, -0.04521) to (-0.08943 + 0.04521, 0.04521), i.e. (-0.13464, -0.04521) to (-0.04422, 0.04521).
           This means the right edge of Object 6 (-0.04422) touches the left edge of Object 5 (-0.04422). This is a valid non-collision placement.
           
           So, let's try placement at (-0.08943, 0).
           Check with Object 5 (0,0):
             |x6 - 0| = |-0.08943| = 0.08943. This is >= 0.08943. OK.
             |y6 - 0| = |0| = 0. This is < 0.08943. But since x-condition is met, no collision. OK.
           Check with Object 4 (0.08,0):
             |x6 - 0.08| = |-0.08943 - 0.08| = |-0.16943| = 0.16943. This is >= 0.09337. OK.
             |y6 - 0| = |0| = 0. This is < 0.09337. But since x-condition is met, no collision. OK.
           
           This placement (-0.08943, 0.0) seems stable and non-colliding.
           Let's try a range of placements around this and other potential spots.
           A center of -0.08943 is a bit too precise, I'll round it to -0.09 or use the maximal allowed x.
           Max x for center for object 6 is 0.135 - 0.04521 = 0.08979.
           Min x for center for object 6 is -0.135 + 0.04521 = -0.08979.
           
           Let's try to place it at (-0.08979, 0.0).
           This avoids collision with Object 5 (at 0,0) by x-separation: |-0.08979 - 0| = 0.08979 > 0.08943.
           This avoids collision with Object 4 (at 0.08,0) by x-separation: |-0.08979 - 0.08| = |-0.16979| = 0.16979 > 0.09337.
           
           This placement is valid. Let's explore other quadrants, specifically the ones that are not occupied by Object 4 (positive x) or Object 5 (center).
           Quadrant 2 (-x, +y) and Quadrant 3 (-x, -y) are good candidates.
           Or along the y-axis (0, +/-y).
           If (0, y6):
             Avoid Object 5: |y6| >= 0.08943.
             Avoid Object 4: |y6| >= 0.09337.
           So, |y6| must be >= 0.09337.
           But max y6 can be is 0.08979. This makes (0, +/-y6) impossible for non-collision.
           
           So, Object 6 must be placed where its x-coordinate is significantly negative, or where its x-coordinate is significantly positive (opposite to Object 4 and Object 5).
           Let's try x = -0.08979 (the leftmost possible center).
           y can then vary.
           Let's also try x = 0.08979 (the rightmost possible center).
           If x6 = 0.08979:
             Avoid Object 5 (0,0): |0.08979 - 0| = 0.08979 > 0.08943. Ok on X.
             Avoid Object 4 (0.08,0): |0.08979 - 0.08| = 0.00979 < 0.09337. Collision on X.
               Therefore, for this x6, we need |y6 - 0| >= 0.09337.
               But max y6 is 0.08979. This is < 0.09337.
               So, placing Object 6 at x = 0.08979 will *always* collide with Object 4.
           
           This means all placements must be in the negative x half of the surface.
           The only space is for x6 around -0.08979.
           
           Let's try to slightly shift from (-0.08979, 0.0)
           The y-spread of object 5 is from -0.04422 to 0.04422.
           The y-spread of object 4 is from -0.04816 to 0.04816.
           The y-spread of object 6 is from -0.04521 to 0.04521.
           
           If y6 = 0, then Object 6 is fine with Object 5 on x, and Object 4 on x.
           So (-0.08979, 0.0) is a good candidate.
           Let's try to vary y for this x, but ensure no collision on y.
           For Object 6 at (-0.08979, y6):
           Check with Object 5 (0,0): X-separation is already met (0.08979 > 0.08943). So y6 can be anything as long as on surface.
           Check with Object 4 (0.08,0): X-separation is already met (0.16979 > 0.09337). So y6 can be anything as long as on surface.
           
           So, any placement of the form (-0.08979, y) where -0.08979 <= y <= 0.08979 should be valid.
           
           Placements:
           (0, 0.0, -0.08979, 0.0)
           (0, 1.5707963267948966, -0.08979, 0.0)
           (0, 0.0, -0.08979, 0.02)
           (0, 0.0, -0.08979, -0.02)
           (0, 0.0, -0.08979, 0.04)
           (0, 0.0, -0.08979, -0.04)
           (0, 0.0, -0.08979, 0.06)
           (0, 0.0, -0.08979, -0.06)
           (0, 0.0, -0.08979, 0.08)
           (0, 0.0, -0.08979, -0.08)
           (0, 1.5707963267948966, -0.08979, 0.02)
           (0, 1.5707963267948966, -0.08979, -0.02)
           (0, 1.5707963267948966, -0.08979, 0.04)
           (0, 1.5707963267948966, -0.08979, -0.04)
           (0, 1.5707963267948966, -0.08979, 0.06)
           (0, 1.5707963267948966, -0.08979, -0.06)
           (0, 1.5707963267948966, -0.08979, 0.08)
           (0, 1.5707963267948966, -0.08979, -0.08)
           
           Now, let's consider another part of the surface. What if I tried to place it to the far left, but slightly offset to overlap with the y-range of other objects but with enough x separation.
           
           The available space along the x-axis for Object 6:
           Surface from -0.135 to 0.135.
           Object 5: (-0.04422, -0.04422) to (0.04422, 0.04422)
           Object 4: (0.03184, -0.04816) to (0.12816, 0.04816)
           
           The object 6 half-extent is 0.04521.
           Leftmost x-center: -0.135 + 0.04521 = -0.08979. This is the x coordinate used above.
           
           Let's look for space in the y-direction, for example, where x is 0.
           As determined, if x6=0, |y6| must be >= 0.09337 (due to Object 4 and Object 5). Max y6 is 0.08979, so this is not possible.
           
           What about a "top-left" region?
           Let's try a center at x = -0.06, y = 0.06.
           Check with Object 5 (0,0):
             |x6 - 0| = |-0.06| = 0.06. < 0.08943.
             |y6 - 0| = |0.06| = 0.06. < 0.08943.
           This will collide with Object 5.
           
           It appears the space is quite constrained. The placement at (-0.08979, y) is the most robust strategy.
           I will add more y-coordinates around -0.08979. Also try a few with other rotations (though for square objects, it doesn't change AABB footprint).
           
           Max |y| for center: 0.08979.
           Max |x| for center: 0.08979.
           
           What about the region (-0.08979, 0.08979) and (0.08979, 0.08979) and other corners?
           
           Let's assume the previous placement of object 4 at (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0) and object 5 at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) are correct.
           
           Object 5 AABB: X: [-0.04422, 0.04422], Y: [-0.04422, 0.04422]
           Object 4 AABB: X: [0.03184, 0.12816], Y: [-0.04816, 0.04816]
           Object 6 half-extent: 0.04521.
           
           Region 1: X < -0.04422 - 0.04521 = -0.08943. So x-center of Object 6 must be < -0.08943 (left of Object 5).
              - Minimum x-center is -0.135 + 0.04521 = -0.08979.
              - So x-centers in [-0.08979, -0.08943] could work along with any valid y.
           
           Region 2: X > 0.04422 + 0.04521 = 0.08943 (right of Object 5).
              - But also need to clear Object 4.
              - X for Object 4: [0.03184, 0.12816].
              - If Object 6 is to the right of Object 4, x-center of Object 6 must be > 0.12816 + 0.04521 = 0.17337. This is outside the surface (max x-center 0.08979).
              - If Object 6 is to the left of Object 4, x-center of Object 6 must be < 0.03184 - 0.04521 = -0.01337. This is within the range that clears Object 5.
           
           Region 3: Y < -0.04422 - 0.04521 = -0.08943 (below Object 5).
              - Max y-center is -0.08979.
              - Also need to clear Object 4.
              - Y for Object 4: [-0.04816, 0.04816].
              - If Object 6 is below Object 4, y-center of Object 6 must be < -0.04816 - 0.04521 = -0.09337. This is outside the surface (min y-center -0.08979).
           
           Region 4: Y > 0.04422 + 0.04521 = 0.08943 (above Object 5).
              - Max y-center is 0.08979.
              - Also need to clear Object 4.
              - If Object 6 is above Object 4, y-center of Object 6 must be > 0.04816 + 0.04521 = 0.09337. This is outside the surface (max y-center 0.08979).
           
           So, the only regions for Object 6 (assuming axis-aligned placement for now) are:
           - A. x-center in [-0.08979, -0.08943], and any valid y-center. (This clears Object 5's x-extent and Object 4's x-extent by being to the left of both).
           - B. x-center in [-0.08979, -0.01337] for clearing Object 4. This range is also good for Object 5. So effectively x-center from -0.08979 to -0.01337.
             - BUT if x is in [-0.08943, -0.01337], then Object 6's AABB overlaps Object 5's AABB on x. So we would need to separate on y: |y_center| >= 0.08943. This is not possible as max |y_center| is 0.08979.
           
           This means that the *only* valid axis-aligned placements are those where the x-center is to the left of -0.08943.
           This implies x-center should be in [-0.08979, -0.08943].
           This is a very narrow strip.
           
           Let's try to verify this.
           If center_x of object 6 is in (-0.08943, 0.08943), then it collides on X with object 5, unless its Y is far enough away from object 5.
           If center_y of object 6 is in (-0.08943, 0.08943), then it collides on Y with object 5, unless its X is far enough away from object 5.
           
           If center_x of object 6 is in (0.08 - 0.09337, 0.08 + 0.09337) = (-0.01337, 0.17337), it collides on X with object 4, unless its Y is far enough away from object 4.
           If center_y of object 6 is in (0 - 0.09337, 0 + 0.09337) = (-0.09337, 0.09337), it collides on Y with object 4, unless its X is far enough away from object 4.
           
           Consider x_center from -0.08979 to 0.08979, and y_center from -0.08979 to 0.08979.
           
           Only valid placements seem to be around x=-0.08979.
           I will generate more variations within this very narrow X-band, and varying Y, and also with the pi/2 rotation.
           
           I will use -0.0897 for X to be slightly less precise than the exact edge, but still valid.

           I need 50 placements. I will slightly adjust the x-coordinate to cover the small valid range for x and fill up the remaining spots with more minor variations.
           The X range is [-0.08979, -0.08943]. A very small range. I will use -0.0896 as another valid x center within this range.
