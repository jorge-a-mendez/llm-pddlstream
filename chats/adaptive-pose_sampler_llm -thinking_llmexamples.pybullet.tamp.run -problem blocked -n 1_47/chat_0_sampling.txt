(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for a Square Object**
           
           Okay, I've got a task: place a square object (ID 5, size 0.07 x 0.07) stably on a rectangular surface defined by the points (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0).  My goal is to find 50 distinct placements, each defined by the surface index (0 in this case), rotation angle (theta), and x, y coordinates. The key here is "stable," meaning the entire object must stay within the surface's boundaries.
           
           First, I need to understand how the object's dimensions change as it rotates.  For a given rotation angle, the effective size of its bounding box (the smallest axis-aligned rectangle that contains the object) is critical. Because my object is a square, its bounding box size varies with the angle of rotation, becoming largest at 45 degrees (pi/4) and smallest at 0 degrees.
           
           Let's do the math. The valid range for the object's x and y coordinates depends on this effective size. Essentially, I need to ensure there is enough clearance on all sides, accounting for the rotated bounding box.
           
           My plan is to choose a surface for all placements. Since I'm only given a single surface, that's straightforward. Then, I'll systematically vary the rotation angle (theta) and the (x, y) coordinates of the object's center. I'll sample a range of angles from 0 to pi radians, since for this square object, anything above pi effectively repeats the orientations.
           
           Within this range, I'm going to determine a good spread of theta, calculate the valid x and y range and then generate points within those bounds.
           I will generate those points by evenly spacing `x_samples` and `y_samples` values along each angle.
           This will give `x_samples*y_samples` placements.
           I'll select enough to satisfy the condition of at least 50 unique placements to satisfy.
           
           After calculating, if i do the loop, and the object is found to be outside the bounds, it's immediately removed. If the code still doesn't satisfy the condition, I will re-engineer.
           This approach will ensure I get diverse, stable placements.

(Thoughts: **Okay, let's get this placement sorted for object ID 10 on surface 0, making sure it plays nice with the previously placed object ID 5.** I remember object 5's position: `(0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565)`, and its dimensions `(0.07, 0.07)`, so I have to avoid collisions with it. The surface is defined by `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.
           
           Object 10 is a square, approximately 0.0983 units on each side, so that gives me a clear idea for its AABB dimensions. The key here is generating 50 stable and collision-free placements on the specified surface.
           
           To ensure stability and collision avoidance, I will take these steps:
           
           1.  **Calculate the Valid Surface Area:** I start by determining the bounds of object 10 on surface 0 for different rotations. Then I have to avoid collision with object 5, which resides in the region [4.2, 4.27] x [-0.6, -0.53].
           
           2.  **Rotation Strategies:** I know that the greatest dimensions for object 10 happens when the AABB is at pi/4 radians. I want to generate evenly distributed placements with varied rotations in the range \[0, pi/2).
           
           3.  **Collision Avoidance zones:** For each rotation, I identify the *forbidden* area within the valid surface area, which is the region that overlaps with the AABB of object 5. This will be the region where no placements can occur.
           
           4.  **Sampling from Safe Zones:** Next, I'll calculate sub-regions. I'll sample, ensuring no two generated placements collide. I am confident that these 50 placements will be valid.
           
           Okay, armed with this plan, let's start generating the valid, collision-free placements!
