(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Achieving `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate objective, `new-axiom@0()`, boils down to ensuring an object of a particular type (`v17`) is situated "on" another object (`v18`).  After a thorough examination of the initial state, I've identified two potential candidates: `v8` and `v12`, both of type `v17`.  Since both `v8` and `v12` can be supported by `v18` at pose `#o2`, a solid approach would be to get either object into the "on" state by being supported by `v18`. 
           
           The core of the "on" predicate is defined by two sub-goals: being "supported" by and "atpose". Now, looking at the available facts, it's clear that both objects are supported by different objects initially. I will try to achieve the goal by moving the objects to the target location `#o2`.
           
           `v8` is currently at pose `v9`. So, my plan: I need to 'pick' `v8` from `v9` and then 'place' it at the pose `#o2` on `v18`.  
           
           To execute this plan, I need to consider the preconditions of pick and place actions, and ensure I can reach the final location in configuration `#o3`.
           
           *   **Move Base Action:** First, a `move_base` action (`move_base v3 #o3 #o0`) must be executed to move the robot's base configuration from `v3` to `#o3`, as all our initial state facts use `atbconf(v3)` but the `pick` and `place` actions needs `atbconf(#o3)`. This initial `move_base` action also makes it so that `canmove()` is false and then true.
           *   **Pick Action:** Next, pick `v8` from `v9`. The action requires that: the arm and object can perform the required kinesthetics and that the arm is `handempty`, and `atbconf(#o3)`. If the actions are safe (which I am assuming, based on the problem conditions), I can perform `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)`.
           *   **Place Action:** After picking, I must place `v8` to target pose `#o2`. It also has similar preconditions as the `pick` action. The action: `(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`.
           
           This sequence of actions should ensure that `v8` is "on" `v18` at `#o2`. I am going to check to see if each precondition and effect is satisfied. Since the goal `new-axiom@0()` demands `type(v8,v17)` and `on(v8, v18)`, this action sequence should result in achieving the given goal. The alternative action plan of moving `v12` would work the same. All facts needed are stated in the provided PDDL, and so I can assume any missing predicate is false. This plan of `(move_base)`, `(pick)`, and `(place)` should achieve the goal state.
