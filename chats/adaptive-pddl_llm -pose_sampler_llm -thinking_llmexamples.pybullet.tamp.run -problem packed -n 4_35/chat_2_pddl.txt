           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My approach to solving this planning problem is straightforward, given the initial state and the goal. The core idea is to move the robot arm to a configuration where it can reach the objects currently on surface v11 and subsequently place them all on surface v18. Since the initial state is quite clean and the actions provided are sufficient, the solution boils down to a sequence of pick-and-place operations facilitated by a single base movement.**
           
           First, I need to get the robot arm's base configuration to be compatible with both picking from v11 and placing on v18. The available `basemotion` facts indicate the robot needs to move from its current base configuration, v3, to a specific configuration #o3. Thus, I will use action `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`.
           
           Once the robot's base is in place, the plan can proceed with the following sequence:
           
           1.  **Pick:** For each object (v8, v12, v14, v16), I'll pick it up from its current location on v11 using the `pick` action. This requires the arm to be `handempty` and at the base configuration #o3. The `kin` facts guarantee this is possible.
           2.  **Place:** After picking an object, I'll place it onto surface v18 at pose #o2, using the `place` action. The precondtions that I need to be aware of include: the existence of `kin` information, and that the arm is holding the grasped object. These all need to hold. I will just go through the objects in the order they are provided as such. There is also `neg unsafe` preconditions, but the knowledge base is built to satisfy these without needing to consider them directly.
           
           This pick-and-place sequence is repeated for all four objects. The order in which the objects are picked up and placed does not matter as long as all required actions (pick and place) are executed. The base remains at #o3 during the full pick and place sequence.
           
           Therefore, the complete plan consists of a base movement action followed by a series of pick-and-place actions, ultimately achieving the desired goal state. The assumptions I made are that the `kin` and `basemotion` facts are consistent and that the `unsafe` predicates can be assumed to be false.
