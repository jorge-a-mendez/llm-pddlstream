           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room defined by bounding boxes 0-4. There's a vertical wall in the middle (5), and several smaller obstacles (6-22). The target point is {target_point}. I need to find 3 robot base positions within a distance of 2 from this target point, avoiding obstacles and maintaining line-of-sight. The robot's x and y coordinates must be within [-2.5, 2.5]. I will focus on positions around the target point that are not directly in line with the known obstacles, trying to find clear spots. I will prioritize diversity in the positions to maximize the chance of finding valid spots.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     The target point is (-2.11, 1.82). My previous attempts failed due to collisions and occlusions. (0.0, 0.0) collided with obstacle 5, which is a vertical wall at x=0. This makes sense. (0.5, 0.5) and (-0.5, -0.5) had no line of sight, likely due to obstacle 5 or other obstacles between the proposed position and the target, which is in the upper left quadrant. I need to get closer to the target point and stay on its side of the wall (x < 0). Given the target's location, I will try points in the upper left quadrant, ensuring they are within the max_range of 2. I'll also try to avoid getting too close to the vertical wall at x=0, and the other obstacles in that area (like 8, 10, 12, 19, 20).

Model:     The previous target point was (-2.11, 1.82), but the new target point is (0.30, 1.93). This is a significant change in the target, now in the upper-right quadrant, just to the right of the central wall (obstacle 5). My previous attempts failed for the old target, which is not directly relevant to the new target. However, the general principles of avoiding obstacle 5 (the central wall at x=0) and respecting the max_range still apply.
           
           Given the new target (0.30, 1.93), I need to find positions within 2 units of it. I will primarily look in the upper-right quadrant. The previous positions like (-1.5, 1.8), (-2.0, 0.5), and (-1.0, 1.0) for the old target were problematic and are not suitable for this new target. ( -1.0 1.0) was marked as "not reachable", which seems to imply it was too far from the target or outside of the robot's overall boundaries, though it may have been the former given the max distance constraint from the *new* target point. I need to be careful with distance from the *new* target.
           
           I will try positions close to the target, keeping in mind the other obstacles in the upper right quadrant (e.g., 7, 9, 11, 15, 16, 21, 22). I should also ensure x > 0 to avoid obstacle 5.
           
           Positions:
           (0.5 1.0)
           (1.0 1.5)
           (0.05 1.5)
