(Thoughts: **Reasoning through the Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()` in the `pr2-tamp` Domain**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with finding a plan to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which I've determined expands to `EXISTS ?green . (on(?green, v18) AND type(?green, v17))`.  Since `type(v12, v17)` is already true in the initial state, I just need to achieve `on(v12, v18)`. This hinges on the fact that I can substitute `v12` for `?green` as it has the correct `type` predicate.
           
           Knowing the structure of `on(?o, ?r)`, I can see that achieving this means I need `atpose(v12, #p1)`  because the initial state provides `supported(v12, #p1, v18)`. This immediately directs me toward manipulating object `v12`. I need to move it from its current position `v13`, where it is supported by `v14`, to the desired pose `#p1`, which is supported by `v18`.
           
           My approach will be two-fold:
           1.  **Preparation:** Move the robot base to be adjacent to the locations I need the arm to be.
           2.  **Execution:** Employ the arm to pick up `v12` from `v13` and place it at `#p1`.
           
           Based on the available actions and predicates, I've outlined the following plan.
           
           First I need to move the base from initial config `v3` to a configuration `#q2` to be in a valid position for picking up `v12` from pose `v13`. I'll achieve this with the action `(move_base v3 #q2 #t5)`.
           
           Next, I need to pick up the object using the robot arm. I know I can use `(pick v4 v12 v13 #g1 #q2 #t4)` because it can satisfy the preconditions, based on the initial state facts, and the state change I have observed so far from the base motion.
           
           After that, I move the base to `#q3`, using `(move_base #q2 #q3 #o0)`. This places the base in position to place the object at pose `#p1`.
           
           Finally, I can place the object using `(place v4 v12 #p1 #g1 #q3 #t6)`.
           
           I must consider the `canmove()` predicate. The first and third steps, which are base motion, will make canmove false. Picking and placing the object will set canmove true. This pattern is consistent and works correctly in this plan.
           
           The final state will include `atpose(v12, #p1)` and given `supported(v12, #p1, v18)`, this means `on(v12, v18)` is true, thus satisfying the goal.
           
           There doesn't appear to be any conflicts or other goals impacted by this simple plan, and all the available actions seem appropriate for the task at hand. Since the task says to get to the solution for a least-cost goal, I cannot consider if the plan is correct, since cost functions are not provided in this specific problem. However, as no other objects are involved in the goal, and no redundant actions are suggested, this plan to pick and place seems reasonable and it accomplishes the desired effect, for whatever the cost-function will be. This plan, therefore, appears to be optimal for achieving the goal.
