(Thoughts: **Planning to Satisfy `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which means finding an object, let's call it `?green`, that satisfies two conditions: it's on a specific surface (`v18`) and has a particular type (`v17`).  I immediately see two candidates: `v8` and `v12`. Both are initially of the correct type.
           
           To satisfy the "on" condition, the object needs to be supported by `v18`. Looking at the initial state, both `v8` and `v12` are *supported* by `v18` at pose `#o2` – if they were placed there. Both objects are currently in different positions, `v8` on `v11` at pose `v9` and `v12` on `v14` at pose `v13`.
           
           My plan is to *move* one of these objects to `#o2`. Since the facts are identical for both objects related to `v18`, I'll arbitrarily choose `v8`. The strategy then boils down to:
           
           1.  **Move the base configuration** to `#o3` because that's what the kin predicates use. This should be a base movement action.
           2.  **Pick up `v8` from its current location (`v9`)**.  I see `kin` predicates available, indicating graspable states and initial conditions. This will involve the hand being empty and the base at a known position.
           3.  **Place `v8` at `#o2` on top of `v18`**.
           
           After stepping through the available actions, it seems that there's a problem with the base configuration. The `move_base` action would need to be executed before the `pick` action to set up the appropriate base configuration required for picking and placing `v8`.
           
           So, the definitive plan would be:
           
           1.  `move_base(v3, #o3, #o0)`  - This moves the base from its initial config `v3` to a pre-defined grasp config, `#o3`.
           2.  `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)` - Pick up the object `v8`. The initial pose is `v9`, object `v8` using the arm `v4`. The picking motion uses pre-configured grasp configurations and trajectory planning.
           3.  `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` - Place the object onto the target surface `v18`. Again, the arm must have grasped `v8`.
           
           The plan appears sound. The sequence should successfully move `v8` to the correct configuration to achieve the desired goal. It also seems that picking `v12` would work in the same way. The plan uses the standard actions defined in the state, so there's no problem.
