(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 5**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for an object (ID: 5) on surface 0. This object is a square, measuring approximately 0.07 x 0.07 units. Surface 0 is defined by the points ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)), so it's a rectangle with dimensions 0.6 x 0.6. Stability means the object must be fully contained within this surface.
           
           The placement of an object is defined by `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`. The object must stay within the bounding rectangle when rotated. For this square, its rotated bounding box dimensions depend on the rotation angle `theta`. The rotated width `W` and height `H` will be equal, regardless of `theta`, because it's a square. The maximum and minimum bounding box dimensions will have a ratio to its original side. The values for all placements will be within `surf_idx = 0`.
           
           To generate diverse placements, I'll take this approach:
           
           1.  **Vary Rotation:** I'll use 10 different `theta` values, ranging from 0 to PI radians. For a square, `PI` is sufficient to cover all unique orientations of the bounding box. `theta = k * PI/9` for `k = 0..9`.
           2.  **Calculate Valid Placement Area:** For each `theta`, I'll calculate the rotated bounding box dimensions (`W` and `H`) and use those to determine the valid range for the center of the object's AABB (`x` and `y` coordinates).
           3.  **Spread out (x, y) coordinates:** For each `theta`, I'll generate 5 different `(x, y)` coordinate pairs that are spread out within the valid placement area. I'll include the center of the valid area and four "quarter-ish" points, spaced a certain margin away from the boundary.
           
           This strategy will create 50 placements that should be both stable and varied, fully satisfying the requirements of the task. The resulting set will be a diverse set of possible and stable placements for the given object and surface.

(Thoughts: **Generating Safe Placements for Object ID 10**
           
           Okay, here's the situation: I've got a new request for Object ID 10, which is essentially a square-like shape with side `s = 0.09172`. I need to find 50 stable placements for it on a surface defined as `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. The catch? These placements MUST avoid colliding with the 10 instances of Object ID 5 that were successfully placed previously.  
           
           To do this, I'm taking a very structured approach. First, I need to understand the 'footprint' of each Object ID 5, depending on its rotation angle (theta). Since Object ID 5 has a side length of `0.07`, its bounding box changes shape when rotated. At 0 degrees (or 180 degrees), it's a 0.07x0.07 square.  At 45 degrees (or 135 degrees), the effective box is `0.07 * sqrt(2)` on each side, which is about 0.099.
           
           I've got the exact coordinates of the existing, successful placements of Object ID 5 and their AABBs. My next step is to calculate the bounding boxes for all those instances, using these AABBs. I'll need to accurately compute the bounding boxes using the function `get_rotated_aabb_extents` considering the object's extents and the theta values. 
           
           Now, for Object ID 10, I'll generate a grid of potential placements on the given surface. For each grid point I consider for Object ID 10, I'll:  
           1.  Calculate its bounding box (considering rotation, with 10 theta values).  
           2.  Check if that AABB collides with any of the AABBs of the existing Object ID 5 instances.  
           3.  If it doesn't collide, I'll mark that spot as a valid placement.  
           
           To ensure there are 50 valid placements I will generate candidates with a grid of x and y coordinate, that will depend on valid range for object 10's AABB inside the surface.
           
           I'm confident this method is systematic, complete, and correct. I'll repeat the grid generation with increasing grid density if needed, to avoid missing any valid placements (but with 250 test placements, 50 should be safe). Once I have found 50 safe placements, I will be done.
