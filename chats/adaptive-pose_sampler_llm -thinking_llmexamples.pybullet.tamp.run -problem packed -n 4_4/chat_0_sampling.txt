(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 4 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable positions for this square object (ID 4) on this square surface (Surface 0).  The surface is centered at (0,0) and has a side length of 0.27. The object itself is a square with side length approximately 0.08.  Stability means the object must fit entirely within the surface bounds and not collide with anything else.
           
           Since the object is square and the surface is square, the tricky part is rotation. I know that the object's *world-aligned* bounding box changes as I rotate it. At certain angles (multiples of 45 degrees), the effective size increases due to the rotated AABB. To ensure stability, I'll need to account for this variation in size.
           
           My plan is to consider two key angles: 0 degrees and 45 degrees (pi/4 radians).  At 0 degrees, the object's world-aligned bounding box is simply its original size (0.08). At 45 degrees, the effective side length of the bounding box is its side * sqrt(2) (about 0.11).
           
           I will arrange placements across the surface, in a grid-like fashion, for these two angles.
           I'll position a grid of x and y values for theta = 0, and another grid for theta = pi/4 to ensure a good spread of placement. These x and y values will be calculated for each angle so as to be completely contained within the surface given the world-aligned size.
           
           The objective is to produce 25 placements at theta = 0, and 25 at theta = pi/4 for a total of 50.

(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Non-Colliding Placements for Object ID 5**
           
           Okay, I've got a successful placement for Object ID 4, and now I need to figure out 50 stable placements for a new object, ID 5, on the same surface without any collisions. The surface dimensions and object sizes are all confirmed.
           
           I've already done some preliminary calculations. I know where Object 4's bounding box sits, so I can establish a safe zone where Object 5 can't go to avoid a collision. The general rule is: for the center of object 5, it needs to be "above" or "to the right" of object 4's AABB for a safe placement.
           
           I've run through the calculations for `theta=0` (no rotation), and `theta = pi/4` rotations (45 degrees), defining the valid `x,y` center ranges for Object 5, both with and without rotation. For `theta = 0`, the range is roughly  `[-0.089, 0.089]`. With pi/4 rotation, it's roughly `[-0.07, 0.07]`.
           
           I've defined collision avoidance conditions for different angles: basically, if the AABB of object 5 doesn't overlap object 4's AABB.  I've simplified it to be safer.  I know I want a lot more safe space, so instead of just avoiding touching object 4, I want to keep all of object 5 away from object 4. Then, I can filter based on these simplified collision rules.
           
           I've got the math figured out and, using the valid ranges, I've defined the collision conditions, so I'll generate the placement. I will check whether these points are safe according to the AABB calculations.
           
           I've determined I can generate a good many placements:
           *   21 placements with `theta = 0`.
           *   16 placements with `theta = pi/4`.
           *   21 placements with `theta = pi/2`.
           
           This gives me 37 non-colliding placements so far. I will add 13 valid placements from `theta = pi/2` to get 50. I picked 13 by taking all valid combinations from the range defined by [-0.08, -0.04, 0.0, 0.04, 0.08]. All of these placements will be stable and non-colliding.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Plan for ID 7**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to place 50 stable instances of object ID 7 on surface 0, avoiding collisions with the existing objects, IDs 4 and 5. This is a classic packing problem, and I'll use a brute-force approach, systematically checking placement locations.
           
           **Scene Overview:**
           
           *   Surface 0 is a square, centered at (0, 0) and extends from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           *   Object ID 7 is also a square, with side length `s_7 = 0.098773844`.
           *   Object ID 4 is already positioned at (0, 0, -0.09, -0.09) with an effective side `s_4 = 0.080375123`.
           *   Object ID 5 is at (0, 0, -0.08, 0.0) with an effective side `s_5 = 0.091328907`.
           
           **The Blocking Zone:**
           
           Objects 4 and 5 create a collision hazard, so a region near the bottom-left of surface 0.
           
           *   AABB4:  \[-0.13018756, -0.04981244] x \[-0.13018756, -0.04981244]
           *   AABB5: \[-0.12566445, -0.03433555] x \[-0.04566445, 0.04566445]
           
           These AABBs are crucial because they define where ID 7 *cannot* be, or the minimum collision distance that I need to maintain. The goal is the following logic for any object placement x and y
           1. Collision with AABB4 :
           `x_7 + s_7/2 > x_min_4, x_7 - s_7/2 < x_max_4, y_7 + s_7/2 > y_min_4, y_7 - s_7/2 < y_max_4`
           2. Collision with AABB5
           `x_7 + s_7/2 > x_min_5, x_7 - s_7/2 < x_max_5, y_7 + s_7/2 > y_min_5, y_7 - s_7/2 < y_max_5`
           
           **Strategic Placement Approach:**
           
           I'll be smart about these conditions.
           
           *   I'll analyze several rotations for object ID 7: 0, pi/4, and pi/2.
           *   By setting `x` and `y` bounds, I can avoid collision!
           
           **Collision Zones for Object 7:**
           For each object rotation the object 7's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) needs to be computed. 
           1. If rotated 0/pi:
           - The dimensions of the AABB would be exactly `s_7`
           - The range for x `[-0.085613078, 0.085613078]`
           2. If rotated by `pi/4`, then the dimensions are `sqrt(2) * s_7`
           - The range for x `[-0.0651, 0.0651]`
           3. If rotated by `pi/2` it is the same as the zero rotation, except the x and y change.
           
           I'll then derive the allowed regions by testing different placements. After extensive testing, I was able to define three placement zones.
           1. `Theta = 0, y= [-0.08, 0.08], x > 0.01` with 20 placements
           2. `Theta = pi/4, y = [-0.06, 0.06], x > 0.035` with 15 placements
           3. `Theta = pi/2, y= [-0.08, 0.08], x > 0.01` with 15 placements
           
           **Final Placement Distribution**
           This strategy will achieve the desired 50 stable, collision-free placements.

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's break this down.** My goal is to find 50 stable locations for object ID 6 on surface 0, making sure it doesn't collide with previously placed objects (IDs 4, 5, and 7).
           
           **The Scene:**
           I'm working with a square surface (surface 0) that's 0.27 units wide, centered at (0,0). Object ID 6 is also a square with a side length of approximately 0.095 units. The existing objects are in the way:
           
           *   Object ID 4 is centered near (-0.09, -0.09).
           *   Object ID 5 is centered at (-0.08, 0).
           *   Object ID 7 is centered at (0.02, -0.08).
           
           **Placement Strategy:**
           I need to consider two main things:
           
           1.  **Surface Containment:** Object 6's center needs to stay within the boundaries of surface 0.
           2.  **Collision Avoidance:**  Object 6's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) can't overlap with the AABBs of objects 4, 5, or 7. I'll need to rotate Object 6 to obtain the required number of unique configurations.
           
           I'll start by checking the rotation angles theta = 0, pi/4, pi/2. Each rotation angle is associated with a distinct area of available space to locate the objects.
           
           **Case: Rotation Angle of 0**
           If object 6 is not rotated, the effective AABB side length of the square shape is simply s_6, or 0.095. With this rotation, the center point must satisfy `x_center` in \[0.01314651, 0.08751794] and `y_center` in \[0.01686898, 0.08751794].
           **Placement Generation**
           Given the limited space available, I'll generate a grid of positions with the center points that avoid collisions with the previously placed objects for each angle. With `theta = 0` I can achieve 30 points. For `theta = pi/2` I can get 10 points. For `theta = pi/4` I can get 10 points. This gives me a total of 50.

           *   Object ID 4 is centered near (-0.09, -0.09).
           *   Object ID 5 is centered at (-0.08, 0).
           *   Object ID 7 is centered at (0.02, -0.08).
           
           **Placement Strategy:**
           I need to consider two main things:
           
           1.  **Surface Containment:** Object 6's center needs to stay within the boundaries of surface 0.
           2.  **Collision Avoidance:**  Object 6's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) can't overlap with the AABBs of objects 4, 5, or 7. I'll need to rotate Object 6 to obtain the required number of unique configurations.
           
           I'll start by checking the rotation angles theta = 0, pi/4, pi/2. Each rotation angle is associated with a distinct area of available space to locate the objects.
           
           **Case: Rotation Angle of 0**
           If object 6 is not rotated, the effective AABB side length of the square shape is simply s_6, or 0.095. With this rotation, the center point must satisfy `x_center` in \[0.01314651, 0.08751794] and `y_center` in \[0.01686898, 0.08751794].
           **Placement Generation**
           Given the limited space available, I'll generate a grid of positions with the center points that avoid collisions with the previously placed objects for each angle. With `theta = 0` I can achieve 30 points. For `theta = pi/2` I can get 10 points. For `theta = pi/4` I can get 10 points. This gives me a total of 50.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **My Action Plan for Placing Object ID 7**
           
           Here's my plan, based on the current scene and prior successful placements:
           
           *   **Understand the Situation:** I need to place object ID 7, a square, in a new scene. The key change is the new surface 0 (larger) and the fact that surface 1 now has other objects placed on it.  I'll need to re-evaluate placement on both surface 0 and 1, taking the locations of prior obstacles (4, 5, 6) on surface 1 into account (since they are now on the same surface in the new description).
           
           *   **Object Properties:** Object 7 is a square with a side length of `s_7 = 0.09877`.  I'll need to calculate its bounding box (AABB) for collision checks at different rotations.
           
           *   **Obstacles on Surface 1:**  I've analyzed the existing objects (4, 5, 6) as AABBs to use in collision tests for object 7.  The calculations are correct, but it is clear that surface 1 is a tight fit for object 7. I found a region where it *could* be, and will add additional candidate placements within the same area.
           
           *   **Surface-Specific Strategy:**
               *   **Surface 0 (Prioritized):**  I will prioritize placing object 7 on this larger surface because it's less constrained.  I'll generate a grid of positions, with the goal of covering surface 0 while avoiding (0,0) so the object can be safely placed with no collisions.
               *   **Surface 1 (Secondary):** Surface 1 is extremely tight and I will only attempt a small set of placements there. I will use the known placement of (0, 0.0, 0.02, -0.08) and expand that by checking nearby points that have the same characteristics.
           
           *   **Generating Placement Candidates:**
               *   **For Surface 0:** I am using `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/4` to create positions far away from surface 1, with a diverse x and y sampling.  I know it's large and should be safe. I can choose points at locations to fill the surface.
               *   **For Surface 1:** This is where the work will be, so I will carefully select points, and use the known characteristics to find candidate positions.
           
           *   **Collision Detection:**  I will use AABB overlap to efficiently check for collisions between object 7 and the obstacles.
           
           *   **Final Output:** I will then generate the object 7 positions for surface 0 and 1.
