User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Final Thoughts and Strategy for Robot Base Placement**
           
           Okay, so I've meticulously gone through the problem of finding three valid robot base positions for a given target point, while avoiding obstacles and ensuring line-of-sight. The target is `{target_point}`, and the key is to place the robots within a `max_range` of 2 units from the target, within the global bounds of `[-2.5, 2.5]` for both x and y.
           
           My strategy involves a multi-step approach:
           
           1.  **Scene Understanding:** First, I mentally map the environment using the provided AABBs (axis-aligned bounding boxes) of fixed obstacles.  I pay close attention to the central vertical wall at `x=0`, as it fundamentally divides the space and influences where the robots need to be positioned relative to the target. I've broken down the shapes in my mind, understanding that obstacles 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are mostly outer boundaries or extremely thin, while the other objects may obstruct the LOS.
           
           2.  **Candidate Generation:** I'll leverage a circle-based strategy. I'll generate candidate positions by first imagining a circle centered on the target point with a radius that is a portion of the `max_range`, and then also, I will find several radii such that they approach the max_range.
           
           3.  **Collision and Line-of-Sight Check:** The core of the problem! For each candidate position, I'll perform a dual check:
               *   **Collision Detection:** I ensure that the robot's base (assumed as a point for now) is not inside any of the obstacle AABBs.
               *   **Line-of-Sight (LOS) Check:** This is where things get interesting. I need to guarantee that the straight line connecting the robot's position to the target doesn't intersect any obstacle AABBs. To ensure robust performance, I'll need to use a more precise line-segment intersection algorithm, perhaps a clipped line approach for the obstacle to accurately decide that no AABBs obstruct vision. The x=0 wall is of greatest concern, the function will need to be extremely accurate!
           
           **Key Considerations and Refinements**
           
           *   **Obstacle Awareness:** The obstacle definitions have been carefully inspected. Walls near (0,0) and the other walls near the boundary are important.
           *   **Target Point Influence:** The target point, with an x coordinate of -0.79, is the key input. Its location directly influences the choice of good positions.
           *   **Line-of-Sight Robustness:** The current approach will include some code that is efficient when making comparisons and making decisions about where each position will need to be to avoid all obstacles.
           
           So, I'm confident in the correctness of my approach.
