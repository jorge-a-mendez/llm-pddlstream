           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachability and the Limits of Restricted Movement**
           
           I'm faced with a challenge: to achieve the goal of `new-axiom@0()`, which I've analyzed and broken down. The core issue lies in the `receivedimage` predicates, specifically the need to capture images of four distinct objectives.
           
           My initial thought was to devise a plan using both rovers, `v12` and `v14`, and leveraging their cameras to capture and transmit these images. However, a deeper analysis reveals a critical constraint: the only `move` actions available to the rovers allow them to *stay put* at their initial configurations, `v13` and `v15` respectively.
           
           This immovable constraint creates an insurmountable barrier. The `take_image` action, a prerequisite for capturing images, requires the `imagevisible` predicate to be true. This predicate, in turn, has a strict distance constraint: the rover must be within a maximum of 2 units from the target objective.
           
           I've carefully calculated the distances between the rovers' fixed locations and the image objectives and found that they are all *beyond* the 2-unit limit. Therefore, the essential `imagevisible` precondition can never be met. Even if the rovers could *somehow* have an "implicit" move, it wouldn't matter here, because there is no `move` action.
           
           Consequently, `take_image` and, by extension, `haveimage` and `send_image` cannot be executed, making the `receivedimage` goals unachievable.
           
           While the analysis components (rocks, soil), and lander are present and achievable, the main part of the goal requires taking images.
           
           As a result, the overall goal `new-axiom@0()`, which includes the `receivedimage` predicates, is simply *unreachable* with the given action instances, given the restricted "stay in place" movement available. My analysis shows that no achievable plan exists.
