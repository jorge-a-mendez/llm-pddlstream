User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.622, -0.357), (-4.525, -0.261)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.573, -0.309, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.493, 0.87).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Achievement Plan: `Atom new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan that achieves the goal `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which I've determined involves ensuring an object, specifically `v8`, is located 'on' another object, `v18`, and that its `type` is `v17`. My initial assessment indicates that `v8` must be placed 'on' `v18`, with its type matching `v17`.
           
           I'll start by defining the robot arm as `v4` and, since `v8` is an object, I'll identify a "grasp" position for the robot's end effector. `v8` is currently supported by pose `v9`. I'll employ the defined `pick` and `place` actions using facts from the initial state as premises.
           
           With the preconditions checked, I will create the following plan:
           
           1.  **Pick:** Using arm `v4`, pick object `v8` from pose `v9`, with grasp `#o1`, robot base at configuration `v3`, and utilizing trajectory `#o4`.
           2.  **Place:** Use arm `v4` to place object `v8` at pose `#o2` on surface `v18`, using grasp `#o1`, with the robot at base configuration `v3`, using trajectory `#o4`.
           
           I'll then determine a valid collision-free position for `#o2` for `v8` on `v18`. I'll place `v8` at `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`. This should meet the preconditions required for the robot to move `v8` to that position. The objects at these locations will be ensured not to collide.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Infeasibility of the Plan**
           
           Okay, so I've been presented with a challenge. The previous proposed plan, while conceptually sound, relied on the `pick` and `place` actions, and the only permitted action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This immediately sets off alarm bells in my mind.
           
           The ultimate goal is `on(?green, v18)`, which, given the initial conditions, translates to getting `v8` *on* `v18`. Initially, `v8` is `on(v8, v11)`. My understanding of this domain tells me that `on(v8, v18)` is true if we can make `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)` be true simultaneously. This usually involves manipulation, which necessitates `pick` and `place`.
           
           However, the action `move_base` only affects the base configuration and the `canmove()` predicate. This means it can't change the spatial relationships between objects, like their `atpose` or whether something is `on` something else. It's essentially confined to navigating the robot's base.
           
           Given that `v8` is currently on `v11` and the only action we have is `move_base`, achieving the goal `on(v8, v18)` is impossible. No sequence of `move_base` actions can alter the fact that `v8` is currently supported by `v11`, not `v18`. We're fundamentally blocked.
