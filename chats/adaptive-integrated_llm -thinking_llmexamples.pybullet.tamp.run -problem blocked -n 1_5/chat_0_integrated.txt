User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.622, -0.357), (-4.525, -0.261)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.573, -0.309, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.493, 0.87).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom pose(v15, v16)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom stackable(v12, v18)
           Atom graspable(v15)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom stackable(v15, v10)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v14)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom stackable(v8, v18)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom type(v12, v17)
           Atom type(v8, v17)
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Problem and Determining Unachievability**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a specific type (`v17`) be positioned "on" a particular surface (`v18`).  This "on" condition is defined by two sub-conditions: the object must be *supported* on the surface and *at* a certain *pose*.
           
           Looking at the initial state, I see I have two potential candidates for the object in question: `v12` and `v8`, both of type `v17`.  Crucially, I also see that both `v12` and `v8` are *supported* at pose `#o2` on `v18`.  This is a good start! If I can just get either `v12` or `v8` to that pose `#o2`, I'm golden.
           
           However, the initial state also tells me that `v12` is *at* pose `v13` and `v8` is *at* pose `v9`.  The challenge, therefore, is to move either `v12` or `v8` to `#o2`.
           
           Now, the problem gives me a crucial constraint: I'm only allowed to use a *single* action: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action doesn't actually *move* any objects; it just changes the base configuration.  And crucially, it *cannot* change the `atpose` of any object.
           
           Since I need to change the `atpose` of either `v12` or `v8` to get them to `#o2`, and the only allowed action can't do that, I'm stuck.  I'm left with the fact that `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` are true, but `atpose(v12, #o2)` and `atpose(v8, #o2)` are both false, and the *only* allowed action will not help. No pick and place actions means no change to pose!
           
           Therefore, the goal is unachievable from the given initial state with the specified action limitations.  The sole action does not contribute towards achieving `atpose(?green, #o2)` and so I cannot achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`.
