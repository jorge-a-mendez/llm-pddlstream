User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.1, 0.272, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.558, 0.83).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.103, -0.493), (0.202, -0.394)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.283, -0.19), (-0.198, -0.104)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.146, 0.227), (-0.055, 0.318)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.152, -0.444, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.382, 0.924).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.241, -0.147, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.992, -0.13).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my plan to get those three objects onto the surface!**  My goal is to achieve `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  Currently, all three objects are sitting on `v11`. `v16` is a surface, and I'm going to use arm `v4` to move the objects, because the necessary `kin` relations are available for `v4`.
           
           It's pretty straightforward, really. I'm going to do a series of "pick and place" actions.  The available actions are `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, `cook`. I'll be ignoring `clean` and `cook`. My base `v3` is `atbconf(v3)`, so I don't need `move_base`.
           
           Here's the plan:
           
           1.  **Pick v8:** I'll pick up `v8` from its current location on `v11`, using the grasp `#o1` from base `v3`.
           2.  **Place v8:** Then, I'll place `v8` on `v16` at a specific pose I'll define.
           3.  **Pick v12:** I'll repeat the same process, picking up `v12` from `v11` using the same grasp.
           4.  **Place v12:** I'll place `v12` on `v16` at a different pose.
           5.  **Pick v14:** Lastly, pick `v14` from v11
           6.  **Place v14:** Then, I'll place `v14` on `v16` at a distinct pose.
           
           I'm assuming safe trajectories and poses (that unsafe flags are *false*).  It's critical that the poses I choose for placement on `v16` are *different* for each object because the goal says "at the same pose", and this is impossible. I will treat them as a "same surface" but different locations.
           
           For the continuous parameters. I can see that `#o2` is present in the predicates and it corresponds to a position and orientation.  The system tells me I need to provide continuous values for `#o2`, and these need to be distinct if the objects are placed on the same surface. The object sizes are unknown, but it seems reasonable to place them side-by-side on surface `v16`, which is AABB `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           I'll be placing them in a line:
           *   `v8`:  `-0.08, 0, 0.781, 0.0`
           *   `v12`: `0, 0, 0.781, 0.0`
           *   `v14`: `0.08, 0, 0.781, 0.0`
           
           No further steps are necessary, and I am not including any `move_base` actions, because they are unneeded. The whole plan costs 6. I'm ready to get started!

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Unreachable Goal with Restricted Actions**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a very specific set of actions to work with: only one, in fact - `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  This is a *move_base* action, which essentially does nothing useful. It moves from a pose to the same pose, which is completely ineffective in terms of changing the state of the world to satisfy the goal.
           
           The goal, as I understand it, is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` *on* `v16`. This means I need to arrange things so that the facts `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)` are all true.  To make that happen, I would need to have `atpose` facts which correctly place those objects on top of `v16`, which means `supported` relationships should exist as well.
           
           Now, I *know* I need to pick up the objects at their current locations and then place them at their target locations on `v16`.  However, critically, I only have that `move_base` action. There are no `pick` or `place` actions available to me!
           
           Because I'm limited to this completely useless `move_base` action, I *cannot* change the state of the world. I cannot manipulate `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` to make them *on* `v16`.  Therefore, the problem is, as currently defined, unsolvable. The goal is unreachable given the permitted actions.
