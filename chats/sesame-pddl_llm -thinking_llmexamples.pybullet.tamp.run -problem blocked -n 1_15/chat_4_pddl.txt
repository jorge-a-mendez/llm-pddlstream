           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Path to New Knowledge**
           
           Alright, let's see. My goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which, as I understand it, boils down to having `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` true.  Looks like `?green` needs to be `v12` based on the given types. The initial state tells me that `v12` is supported by `v18` at pose `#o2`.  So really, I need to get `v12` to `#o2`.
           
           The plan?  Simple: pick up `v12` from its initial pose `v13` and place it at `#o2`. I'll need a robot arm, `v4`, for this.  It's currently `handempty` and at base configuration `#o3`, which is convenient.
           
           Now, let's look at the actions:
           *   **Pick:** Before I can pick, I've got to ensure the necessary conditions are met: the robot's within range, it's handempty, the object is at `v13`, and the base configuration is good. All checks out! The `pick` action will then put `v12` in its grasp.
           *   **Place:** Next, I'll need to satisfy the 'place' preconditions: make sure the robot's arm is within range, it's currently grasping the object, the base configuration is good, and nothing is in an unsafe state. The previous pick action takes care of the grasping condition. This action will have the desired effect: `v12` will be at pose `#o2`.
           
           Once I've placed `v12` at `#o2`, and knowing from the start that `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` is true, I'll have satisfied the `on(v12,v18)` condition. Also, `type(v12, v17)` is true initially. Therefore, my target `new-axiom@0()` is finally TRUE.
           
           I don't need any base movements.  The current configuration `#o3` works just fine for these pick and place actions. So, no need to complicate things with an unnecessary move_base call.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', #o3) is not satisfied!`. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Plan Failure and Goal Unreachability**
           
           Okay, so the previous plan failed because `atbconf(#o3)` wasn't satisfied. I need to figure out why and whether the goal is even achievable. I initially made a mistake by confusing `bconf(#o3)` (base configuration) with `atbconf(#o3)` (at base configuration). These are distinct.
           
           The overall goal is `on(v12, v18)`, which, given `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`, translates to getting `v12` to `atpose(v12, #o2)`. Currently, `v12` is at `v13`. So, I need to pick it from `v13` and place it at `#o2`.
           
           Examining the `pick` action `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)`, I see the key precondition: `atbconf(#o3)`. This is *not* true in the initial state. The only way to achieve `atbconf(#o3)` is through `move_base`: `(move_base #o3 #o3 #o0)`. However, *this action also requires* `atbconf(#o3)` as a precondition! It's a catch-22.
           
           I need to confirm if `atbconf` is really false. Checking the problem description again, facts not explicitly stated are false, which means it is indeed *false*. There is no way to reach `atbconf(#o3)` as the robot is not currently "at" any known base configuration in the initial state.
           
           Since both the `pick` and `move_base` actions rely on `atbconf(#o3)` being true, and there's no path to make it true given the available actions, the goal `on(v12, v18)` is unreachable. I'm confident there's no way to manipulate `v12` to its final goal state.
