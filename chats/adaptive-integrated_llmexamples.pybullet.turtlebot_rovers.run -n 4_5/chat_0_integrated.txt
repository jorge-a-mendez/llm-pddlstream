           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:

           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem states that the goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom representing a conjunction of several conditions. Let's break down the axiom:
           
           `new-axiom@0()` is true if all of the following are true:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover v12 is at configuration v13.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover v14 is at configuration v15.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: Rover v12's store v16 is free.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: Rover v14's store v16 is free.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: Image of objective v17 (type unknown, AABB `((-0.684, 2.131), (-0.605, 2.21))`) with mode v11 has been received.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Image of objective v18 (type unknown, AABB `((-2.014, 1.891), (-1.938, 1.967))`) with mode v11 has been received.
           7. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: Image of objective v19 (type unknown, AABB `((1.942, 2.11), (2.012, 2.18))`) with mode v11 has been received.
           8. `receivedimage(v20, v11)`: Image of objective v20 (type unknown, AABB `((0.282, 1.772), (0.379, 1.868))`) with mode v11 has been received.
           9. `type(?stone, v2)`: There is a rock of type v2 (stone).
           10. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: Analysis of this stone has been received.
           11. `type(?soil, v6)`: There is a rock of type v6 (soil).
           12. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: Analysis of this soil has been received.
           
           Let's check the initial state:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` is true.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)` is true.
           - `free(v12, v16)` is true.
           - `free(v14, v16)` is true.
           
           So, the first four conditions are met. We need to satisfy the remaining conditions regarding received images and received analyses.
           
           For the images, we need to:
           - Take an image of `v17` with `v11` using camera `v10` and send it.
           - Take an image of `v18` with `v11` using camera `v10` and send it.
           - Take an image of `v19` with `v11` using camera `v10` and send it.
           - Take an image of `v20` with `v11` using camera `v10` and send it.
           
           For the analyses, we need to:
           - Sample a rock of type `v2` (stone) and send its analysis.
               - Rocks of type `v2`: `v3`, `v1`, `v4`.
           - Sample a rock of type `v6` (soil) and send its analysis.
               - Rocks of type `v6`: `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           
           All relevant actions (calibrate, take_image, send_image, sample_rock, send_analysis) are not explicitly provided in the list of allowed actions. The only allowed actions are `move v12 v13 #o2 v13`, `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`, `drop_rock v12 v16`, and `drop_rock v14 v16`.
           
           Since the initial state already satisfies the `atconf` and `free` conditions for both rovers, and the goal requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates to be true, but no actions are available to achieve these predicates (calibrate, take_image, send_image, sample_rock, send_analysis), the goal is unreachable. The only available actions are `move` and `drop_rock`, which do not lead to the desired image or analysis reception.
           
           --Plan--:
           The goal is not achievable because the necessary actions (take_image, send_image, sample_rock, send_analysis, calibrate) are not available in the list of allowed action instances. The initial state already satisfies the `atconf` and `free` conditions, and the provided actions cannot change the state to satisfy `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `The goal is not achievable because the necessary actions (take_image, send_image, sample_rock, send_analysis, calibrate)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The problem is to achieve the goal `Atom new-axiom@0()`. As analyzed before, this axiom requires several `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates to be true, along with `atconf` and `free` predicates.
           
           From the initial state:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` is true.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)` is true.
           - `free(v12, v16)` is true.
           - `free(v14, v16)` is true.
           
           These four conditions for `new-axiom@0()` are already met in the initial state.
           
           The remaining conditions for `new-axiom@0()` are:
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v20, v11)`
           - `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`
           - `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           The available actions are:
           - `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This moves rover v12 from v13 to v13. It doesn't change the state in a meaningful way for achieving the goal's unmet conditions.
           - `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This moves rover v14 from v15 to v15. Similar to the above, it doesn't help with the goal.
           - `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires `full(v12, v16)` as a precondition. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, meaning the store is not full. Therefore, this action is not executable.
           - `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: This action requires `full(v14, v16)` as a precondition. In the initial state, `free(v14, v16)` is true, meaning the store is not full. Therefore, this action is not executable.
           
           None of the allowed actions can lead to `haveimage`, `receivedimage`, `analyzed`, or `receivedanalysis` predicates becoming true. The goal requires these predicates to be true. Since these predicates are not true in the initial state and cannot be made true by any of the allowed actions, the goal is unreachable.
           
           Given the constraints that I can only use the provided actions and cannot assume any other actions are available, the goal is unachievable. Therefore, no plan can be generated.
