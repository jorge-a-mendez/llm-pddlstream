(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 4 on surface 0. This is pretty straightforward. I've got the object's dimensions and the surface's definition.  The main challenge here is to ensure the placements are *stable*, meaning they fit within the surface's boundaries, and that I'm generating a variety of poses.
           
           **Geometric Considerations**
           
           The object is a square (thanks to `size_x == size_y`).  That simplifies things considerably. The surface is also a square. I'm thinking about how the object's bounding box changes with rotation, and how that impacts where I can place it. I'm going to define the surface bounds as `S_min` and `S_max`.  I know that for no rotation, I have a clear calculation.
           
           The rotation piece is crucial.  The effective bounding box dimensions depend on the rotation angle (theta).  I've double-checked my formulas and the maximum effective size will be a diagonal of the rotated square. The minimum at 0, pi/2 angles.  I've nailed down that the object is comfortably fitting within the surface. I need to get 50 placements so that is enough diversity for now, I can refine it later if necessary. I'll need to figure out how to calculate the bounding box based on the rotation.
           
           **Strategy for Placement Generation**
           
           My strategy is to vary both the rotation (theta) and the position (x, y) of the object's center. I'm going to create a system where I will cycle through an array of rotations. I can place the object at various valid (x,y) coordinates within each rotation, ensuring the object doesn't spill out of the surface.  I will take care to build an edge case, corner and center case to make sure a diverse set is generated. This seems like a solid, systematic approach. This will give me good coverage.
           
           **Detailed Calculations and Parameters**
           
           I've already figured out the necessary ranges and bounds.
           
            *   I'll calculate the rotation ranges.
            *   I'll consider the impact of these ranges on each individual coordinate.
            *   I want to evenly distribute the coordinates across the bounding box.
           
           **Generation of Placements**
           
           I need 50, and I'm thinking of ten rotations and five placements per rotation as a good starting point. I'll make sure each placement is calculated. The structure is simple: `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`. I will store this. I will carefully craft all the individual placements. This should give me a sufficient distribution.
           
           In summary, this is a reasonable approach. I've broken down the problem, identified the key calculations, and developed a systematic strategy for generating the placements. I'm confident this will produce a set of 50 stable placements. I will generate them.

(Thoughts: **My Approach to Stable Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new object, ID 6, that I need to place stably on surface 0, and crucially, I need to avoid any collisions with the existing object, ID 4.  The feedback I got confirms that the placement of ID 4 at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) was successful, so that's a known quantity.
           
           Here's the situation: Object 6 is a square, and I know its extents and the surface boundaries.  Object 4 is also a square, and I've calculated its AABB.  Since object 4 is fixed at (0,0), its AABB is simply a square centered around the origin.
           
           My primary strategy is to place object 6 *outside* of object 4's AABB.  To do this efficiently, I'm going to determine a "forbidden" region within the surface area where a collision will occur.  Since object 4's AABB is centered at the origin and is not rotated, the collision detection is simplified: I just need to make sure the center of object 6 lies outside the collision boundary imposed by object 4 and its half-extent.
           
           I've calculated the effective half-dimension of object 6's AABB, `half_L_eff_6(theta)`, which is dependent on its rotation angle, `theta`. To avoid any overlap, the center of object 6 needs to be placed at a distance from the origin that is greater than `half_L_eff_6(theta)` plus the half-extent of object 4.  For simplicity, object 4 is static, its half-extent is just `s_4 / 2`. 
           
           I need to generate 50 unique placements.  Given that I need to vary the angle `theta`, I'll attempt to use several angles to ensure diversity. However, I can anticipate that with the problem constraints, I am likely constrained to using fewer angles for successful placements. 
           
           To determine where I *can* place the object without collisions, I'll calculate the valid regions on the surface. Because of the limited available space, the problem can be broken down this way: if `theta` is close to 45 degrees, the bounds may be too tight, so I will select for `theta=0` or `theta=90` to expand the opportunities. Then I will calculate `h6_eff(theta)`, `max_c`, and `coll_bound`. If `max_c` is greater or equal to `coll_bound` a placement may be valid, but if `max_c < coll_bound` then all valid placements are within the intersection of the AABBs.
           
           Here's my refined process for the best possible results:
           
           1.  **Angle Selection:** Given that most other angles might not offer much room for placement, I'll limit the search to `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/2`. The `h6_eff(theta)`, `max_c`, and `coll_bound` are the same.
           2.  **Point Generation:**  I will construct a grid-based approach. Since both of these angles have the same collision area, I can generate one placement set and use it for both. The `x` and `y` coordinates for the placements will be chosen to be on the borders of the valid range.
           
           Ultimately, I will generate a comprehensive set of 50 stable and collision-free placements, each with a valid set of position parameters, so that the object does not collide.
