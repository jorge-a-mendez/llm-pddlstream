           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Analysis: An Impossible Task**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to formulate a plan to arrange five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) on surface v20. That is, to achieve the state: `on(v8, v20)`, `on(v12, v20)`, `on(v14, v20)`, `on(v16, v20)`, `on(v18, v20)`.
           
           My initial analysis reveals a familiar setup: robot arms (v4 and v6), their configurations, grasping capabilities (`graspable`), and the initial positions of the objects on surface v11.  The crucial point is that I must move these objects from their current supported positions (`on(obj, v11)`) to the goal surface v20.
           
           The state description has various parameters to model object pose, grasp, trajectories and base/arm configurations and kinematics facts for grasping and placing.
           
           However, the action instance constraints provided are absolute.  I'm *only* permitted to use a single action instance: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This is a base motion that effectively does *nothing* in the context of the goal.  It moves the base from and back to the same configuration `v3`.
           
           To move the objects, I would need a `pick` action to grasp an object, and a `place` action to deposit it on v20. The `kin` facts suggest that `pick` and `place` actions are available, they also define the necessary arm trajectories and base configurations. They relate the current poses of the objects and the possible poses (on v10 and v20), along with the feasible grasps for those objects.
           
           But here's the catch: the problem explicitly states that *only* the single `move_base` action is allowed.  The actions needed to grasp, lift, move and set the objects: `pick` and `place`, are forbidden by this constraint.
           
           Therefore, given the allowed action instances, there is no way to alter the initial state to reach the desired final state. The goal is provably unachievable within the given constraints.
