           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27. The object is a square with side length approximately 0.08. Since the object is a square, its orientation does not affect its AABB. Therefore, I will primarily consider placing it with an angle of 0.
           
           To ensure the object is fully contained within the surface, I need to make sure its center is within the bounds of the surface, considering half of the object's size.
           The surface extends from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           The object has a size_x and size_y of approximately 0.07984. Half of this is approximately 0.03992.
           
           So, the valid range for the center of the object (x, y) on surface 0 will be:
           x: [-0.135 + 0.03992, 0.135 - 0.03992] = [-0.09508, 0.09508]
           y: [-0.135 + 0.03992, 0.135 - 0.03992] = [-0.09508, 0.09508]
           
           I will generate placements by varying the x and y coordinates within these valid ranges, and also try some different angles, although for a square object, the angle only matters if the AABB is being rotated for the placement, which it is not in this formulation, but it's good practice to try varied angles.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27.
           I know that object 4 was successfully placed at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Object 4 has dimensions (0.0798, 0.0798).
           
           The current object, ID 7, is a square with side length approximately 0.0889. Similar to the previous object, its AABB does not change with rotation.
           
           To ensure the object 7 is fully contained within the surface, I need to make sure its center is within the bounds of the surface, considering half of the object's size.
           The surface extends from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           Object 7 has a size_x and size_y of approximately 0.088915. Half of this is approximately 0.044457.
           
           So, the valid range for the center of object 7 (x, y) on surface 0 will be:
           x: [-0.135 + 0.044457, 0.135 - 0.044457] = [-0.090543, 0.090543]
           y: [-0.135 + 0.044457, 0.135 - 0.044457] = [-0.090543, 0.090543]
           
           I must also avoid collision with object 4, which is centered at (0,0) and has dimensions (0.0798, 0.0798).
           Half of object 4's size is 0.0399. So, object 4 occupies the region from -0.0399 to 0.0399 in x and y.
           
           To avoid collision with object 4, the new object 7 must not overlap with this region.
           Specifically, if object 7 is placed at (x7, y7), its extent will be:
           x: [x7 - 0.044457, x7 + 0.044457]
           y: [y7 - 0.044457, y7 + 0.044457]
           
           To avoid collision, the new object's AABB must not intersect object 4's AABB.
           This means:
           x7 - 0.044457 >= 0.0399 OR x7 + 0.044457 <= -0.0399
           AND
           y7 - 0.044457 >= 0.0399 OR y7 + 0.044457 <= -0.0399
           
           Solving for x7:
           x7 >= 0.0399 + 0.044457 = 0.084357
           OR
           x7 <= -0.0399 - 0.044457 = -0.084357
           
           Solving for y7:
           y7 >= 0.0399 + 0.044457 = 0.084357
           OR
           y7 <= -0.0399 - 0.044457 = -0.084357
           
           Combining with surface bounds:
           x: [-0.090543, -0.084357] U [0.084357, 0.090543]
           y: [-0.090543, -0.084357] U [0.084357, 0.090543]
           
           These are very tight valid regions. I will pick coordinates from these regions.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27.

           The current object, ID 6, is a square with side length approximately 0.0901. Similar to the previous objects, its AABB does not change with rotation.
           
           To ensure object 6 is fully contained within the surface, I need to make sure its center is within the bounds of the surface, considering half of the object's size.

           y6 <= 0.042543 - 0.045039 = -0.002496
           
           Combining all constraints:
           Surface bounds: x, y in [-0.089961, 0.089961]
           
           From object 4 collision:
           x6 in [-0.089961, -0.084939] U [0.084939, 0.089961]
           y6 in [-0.089961, -0.084939] U [0.084939, 0.089961]
           
           From object 7 collision:
           x6 <= -0.002496 or x6 >= 0.176496 (ignore this part as it's outside surface bounds)
           y6 <= -0.002496 or y6 >= 0.176496 (ignore this part as it's outside surface bounds)
           
           So we need to find x6, y6 such that:
           x6 in [-0.089961, -0.084939] AND x6 <= -0.002496 (which is true for the first range)
           x6 in [0.084939, 0.089961] AND x6 <= -0.002496 (no overlap)
           So only x6 in [-0.089961, -0.084939] is possible for x.
           
           Similarly for y6:
           y6 in [-0.089961, -0.084939] AND y6 <= -0.002496 (which is true for the first range)
           y6 in [0.084939, 0.089961] AND y6 <= -0.002496 (no overlap)
           So only y6 in [-0.089961, -0.084939] is possible for y.
           
           This means object 6 can only be placed in the bottom-left corner of the surface to avoid objects 4 and 7.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the collision with object 7 for specific coordinates in the bottom-left quadrant.
           If x6 is in [-0.089961, -0.084939] and y6 is in [-0.089961, -0.084939].
           Object 6 AABB is roughly [-0.135, -0.0399] for x, and [-0.135, -0.0399] for y.
           Object 7 AABB is [0.042543, 0.131457], [0.042543, 0.131457].
           These two regions are far apart, so there will be no collision if object 6 is in the bottom-left collision-free region from object 4.
           
           Therefore, the valid placement region for object 6 is approximately:
           x: [-0.0899, -0.085]
           y: [-0.0899, -0.085]

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27.
           I know that object 4 was successfully placed at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Object 4 has dimensions (0.0798, 0.0798). Half size: 0.0399. AABB: x: [-0.0399, 0.0399], y: [-0.0399, 0.0399].
           I know that object 7 was successfully placed at (0, 0.0, 0.087, 0.087). Object 7 has dimensions (0.0889, 0.0889). Half size: 0.044457. AABB: x: [0.042543, 0.131457], y: [0.042543, 0.131457].
           I know that object 6 was successfully placed at (0, 0.0, -0.087, -0.087). Object 6 has dimensions (0.0901, 0.0901). Half size: 0.045039. AABB: x: [-0.132039, -0.041961], y: [-0.132039, -0.041961].
           
           The current object, ID 5, is a square with side length approximately 0.081. Its AABB does not change with rotation.
           
           To ensure object 5 is fully contained within the surface, I need to make sure its center is within the bounds of the surface, considering half of the object's size.
           The surface extends from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           Object 5 has a size_x and size_y of approximately 0.080999. Half of this is approximately 0.0405.
           
           So, the valid range for the center of object 5 (x, y) on surface 0 will be:
           x: [-0.135 + 0.0405, 0.135 - 0.0405] = [-0.0945, 0.0945]
           y: [-0.135 + 0.0405, 0.135 - 0.0405] = [-0.0945, 0.0945]
           
           Let (x5, y5) be the center of object 5. Half size is 0.0405.
           Object 5's AABB: [x5 - 0.0405, x5 + 0.0405], [y5 - 0.0405, y5 + 0.0405].
           
           Collision with Object 4 (center (0,0), half size 0.0399):
           x5 - 0.0405 >= 0.0399 OR x5 + 0.0405 <= -0.0399
           x5 >= 0.0399 + 0.0405 = 0.0804
           OR

           y5 >= 0.0399 + 0.0405 = 0.0804
           OR

           Summarizing collision constraints and surface bounds [-0.0945, 0.0945]:
           
           From Obj 4:
           x5 in [-0.0945, -0.0804] U [0.0804, 0.0945]
           y5 in [-0.0945, -0.0804] U [0.0804, 0.0945]
           
           From Obj 7:
           x5 <= 0.002043
           y5 <= 0.002043
           
           From Obj 6:
           x5 >= -0.001461
           y5 >= -0.001461
           
           Let's combine these:
           For x5:
           (x5 in [-0.0945, -0.0804] U [0.0804, 0.0945]) AND (x5 <= 0.002043) AND (x5 >= -0.001461)
           
           The condition (x5 <= 0.002043) AND (x5 >= -0.001461) means x5 must be in [-0.001461, 0.002043].
           This interval has no overlap with [-0.0945, -0.0804] or [0.0804, 0.0945].
           This means there are no valid placements for x5 and y5 that do not collide with existing objects, which implies a very central placement would be impossible due to multiple objects around the center.
           
           Let's re-examine the regions for each object and the available space.
           Surface: x,y in [-0.135, 0.135]
           Object 4: centered at (0,0), radius 0.0399. AABB: [-0.0399, 0.0399], [-0.0399, 0.0399]
           Object 7: centered at (0.087, 0.087), radius 0.044457. AABB: [0.042543, 0.131457], [0.042543, 0.131457]
           Object 6: centered at (-0.087, -0.087), radius 0.045039. AABB: [-0.132039, -0.041961], [-0.132039, -0.041961]
           
           Object 5 (current): radius 0.0405.
           Possible x-ranges for center of object 5, considering surface bounds: [-0.0945, 0.0945].
           Possible y-ranges for center of object 5, considering surface bounds: [-0.0945, 0.0945].
           
           Let's look at the remaining open space for object 5:
           Consider the quadrants not occupied:
           Top-Left quadrant: x-range: [-0.0945, -0.001461], y-range: [0.0804, 0.0945]
           Bottom-Right quadrant: x-range: [0.0804, 0.0945], y-range: [-0.0945, -0.001461]
           
           Specifically, to avoid obj 4:
           x5 must be outside [-0.0804, 0.0804] AND y5 must be outside [-0.0804, 0.0804] - This statement is incorrect. If one is outside, it's enough.
           Correct interpretation for avoiding Obj 4:
           x5 < -0.0399 - 0.0405 = -0.0804 OR x5 > 0.0399 + 0.0405 = 0.0804
           OR
           y5 < -0.0399 - 0.0405 = -0.0804 OR y5 > 0.0399 + 0.0405 = 0.0804
           
           So, for x5, it must be in [-0.0945, -0.0804] U [0.0804, 0.0945].
           And for y5, it must be in [-0.0945, -0.0804] U [0.0804, 0.0945].
           
           This creates 4 quadrants where object 5 could be placed without colliding with object 4.
           1. Top-Right: x in [0.0804, 0.0945], y in [0.0804, 0.0945]
           2. Top-Left: x in [-0.0945, -0.0804], y in [0.0804, 0.0945]
           3. Bottom-Right: x in [0.0804, 0.0945], y in [-0.0945, -0.0804]
           4. Bottom-Left: x in [-0.0945, -0.0804], y in [-0.0945, -0.0804]
           
           Now check collision with Obj 7 (AABB: x: [0.042543, 0.131457], y: [0.042543, 0.131457])
           and Obj 6 (AABB: x: [-0.132039, -0.041961], y: [-0.132039, -0.041961]).
           
           Let's evaluate each quadrant:
           1. Top-Right: x in [0.0804, 0.0945], y in [0.0804, 0.0945]
              Object 5 AABB: [x5 - 0.0405, x5 + 0.0405], [y5 - 0.0405, y5 + 0.0405]
              Min x5 = 0.0804 -> x_min = 0.0804 - 0.0405 = 0.0399
              Max x5 = 0.0945 -> x_max = 0.0945 + 0.0405 = 0.135
              So, x-range for object 5 is roughly [0.0399, 0.135]
              Min y5 = 0.0804 -> y_min = 0.0804 - 0.0405 = 0.0399
              Max y5 = 0.0945 -> y_max = 0.0945 + 0.0405 = 0.135
              So, y-range for object 5 is roughly [0.0399, 0.135]
              Object 7 AABB: x: [0.042543, 0.131457], y: [0.042543, 0.131457]
              These ranges *overlap significantly*. For example, (0.087, 0.087) is the center of object 7, and its region [0.042543, 0.131457] x [0.042543, 0.131457]
              The quadrant 1 for object 5's center, if taken to extreme, could collide with object 7.
              Let's ensure non-collision with object 7 for points in quadrant 1 for object 5:
              x5 + 0.0405 <= 0.042543 (this means x5 <= 0.002043, which is not in [0.0804, 0.0945]) OR
              x5 - 0.0405 >= 0.131457 (this means x5 >= 0.171957, which is not in [0.0804, 0.0945])
              This means if we try to place obj 5 in Q1, it will *always* collide with obj 7. This quadrant is blocked.
           
           2. Top-Left: x in [-0.0945, -0.0804], y in [0.0804, 0.0945]
              Object 5 AABB: [x5 - 0.0405, x5 + 0.0405], [y5 - 0.0405, y5 + 0.0405]
              Rough x-range for object 5: [-0.135, -0.0399]
              Rough y-range for object 5: [0.0399, 0.135]
              Object 6 AABB: x: [-0.132039, -0.041961], y: [-0.132039, -0.041961]
              Object 7 AABB: x: [0.042543, 0.131457], y: [0.042543, 0.131457]
              This quadrant is far from Object 7.
              Let's check collision with object 6 for points in quadrant 2 for object 5:
              x5 + 0.0405 <= -0.132039 (this means x5 <= -0.172539, which is not in [-0.0945, -0.0804]) OR
              x5 - 0.0405 >= -0.041961 (this means x5 >= -0.001461, which is not in [-0.0945, -0.0804])
              This means if we try to place obj 5 in Q2, it will *always* collide with obj 6. This quadrant is blocked.
           
           3. Bottom-Right: x in [0.0804, 0.0945], y in [-0.0945, -0.0804]
              Object 5 AABB: [x5 - 0.0405, x5 + 0.0405], [y5 - 0.0405, y5 + 0.0405]
              Rough x-range for object 5: [0.0399, 0.135]
              Rough y-range for object 5: [-0.135, -0.0399]
              This quadrant is far from Object 6.
              Let's check collision with object 7 for points in quadrant 3 for object 5:
              x5 + 0.0405 <= 0.042543 (x5 <= 0.002043, not in [0.0804, 0.0945]) OR
              x5 - 0.0405 >= 0.131457 (x5 >= 0.171957, not in [0.0804, 0.0945])
              This means if we try to place obj 5 in Q3, it will *always* collide with obj 7. This quadrant is blocked.
           
           4. Bottom-Left: x in [-0.0945, -0.0804], y in [-0.0945, -0.0804]
              Object 5 AABB: [x5 - 0.0405, x5 + 0.0405], [y5 - 0.0405, y5 + 0.0405]
              Rough x-range for object 5: [-0.135, -0.0399]
              Rough y-range for object 5: [-0.135, -0.0399]
              Let's check collision with object 6 for points in quadrant 4 for object 5:
              x5 + 0.0405 <= -0.132039 (x5 <= -0.172539, not in [-0.0945, -0.0804]) OR
              x5 - 0.0405 >= -0.041961 (x5 >= -0.001461, not in [-0.0945, -0.0804])
              This means if we try to place obj 5 in Q4, it will *always* collide with obj 6. This quadrant is blocked.
           
           It seems my initial understanding of the "OR" condition for non-collision for the individual objects was incorrect when combined for multiple objects.
           A better way to think about it:
           Find the total "forbidden" region (union of AABBs of all placed objects, expanded by half size of current object). Then find valid coordinates within surface bounds but outside the forbidden region.
           
           Forbidden region from object 4:
           x: [-0.0399 - 0.0405, 0.0399 + 0.0405] = [-0.0804, 0.0804]
           y: [-0.0399 - 0.0405, 0.0399 + 0.0405] = [-0.0804, 0.0804]
           
           Forbidden region from object 7:
           Object 7 AABB: x: [0.042543, 0.131457], y: [0.042543, 0.131457]
           Expand by 0.0405:
           x: [0.042543 - 0.0405, 0.131457 + 0.0405] = [0.002043, 0.171957]
           y: [0.042543 - 0.0405, 0.131457 + 0.0405] = [0.002043, 0.171957]
           
           Forbidden region from object 6:
           Object 6 AABB: x: [-0.132039, -0.041961], y: [-0.132039, -0.041961]
           Expand by 0.0405:
           x: [-0.132039 - 0.0405, -0.041961 + 0.0405] = [-0.172539, -0.001461]
           y: [-0.132039 - 0.0405, -0.041961 + 0.0405] = [-0.172539, -0.001461]
           
           Let's look at the union of the X forbidden intervals:
           [-0.0804, 0.0804]
           [0.002043, 0.171957]
           [-0.172539, -0.001461]
           
           Union of these X intervals:
           Min is -0.172539, Max is 0.171957.
           This is roughly [-0.1725, 0.172]
           
           Similarly for Y forbidden intervals:
           [-0.0804, 0.0804]
           [0.002043, 0.171957]
           [-0.172539, -0.001461]
           
           Union of these Y intervals:
           Min is -0.172539, Max is 0.171957.
           This is roughly [-0.1725, 0.172]
           
           The valid range for object 5's center, considering only the surface bounds, is [-0.0945, 0.0945].
           If the forbidden region spans from -0.1725 to 0.172, and the surface bounds are -0.0945 to 0.0945, then the entire area within the surface bounds is covered by the forbidden regions. This suggests no stable placement is possible.
           
           This is highly unlikely given the problem constraints (always find a placement). I need to re-think my collision logic.
           The "forbidden region" for the center of the current object is the region where its AABB *overlaps* with the AABB of an existing object.
           
           Let current object C be placed at (cx, cy) with half extents (hcx, hcy).
           Let existing object E be at (ex, ey) with half extents (ehx, ehy).
           
           Collision occurs if:
           abs(cx - ex) < (hcx + ehx) AND abs(cy - ey) < (hcy + ehy)
           
           So, for object 4 (center (0,0), half size 0.0399), and object 5 (half size 0.0405):
           abs(cx - 0) < (0.0405 + 0.0399) = 0.0804 => cx in (-0.0804, 0.0804)
           abs(cy - 0) < (0.0405 + 0.0399) = 0.0804 => cy in (-0.0804, 0.0804)
           So, forbidden region from object 4: x in (-0.0804, 0.0804), y in (-0.0804, 0.0804).
           
           For object 7 (center (0.087, 0.087), half size 0.044457), and object 5 (half size 0.0405):
           abs(cx - 0.087) < (0.0405 + 0.044457) = 0.084957 => cx in (0.087 - 0.084957, 0.087 + 0.084957) = (0.002043, 0.171957)
           abs(cy - 0.087) < (0.0405 + 0.044457) = 0.084957 => cy in (0.087 - 0.084957, 0.087 + 0.084957) = (0.002043, 0.171957)
           So, forbidden region from object 7: x in (0.002043, 0.171957), y in (0.002043, 0.171957).
           
           For object 6 (center (-0.087, -0.087), half size 0.045039), and object 5 (half size 0.0405):
           abs(cx - (-0.087)) < (0.0405 + 0.045039) = 0.085539 => cx in (-0.087 - 0.085539, -0.087 + 0.085539) = (-0.172539, -0.001461)
           abs(cy - (-0.087)) < (0.0405 + 0.045039) = 0.085539 => cy in (-0.087 - 0.085539, -0.087 + 0.085539) = (-0.172539, -0.001461)
           So, forbidden region from object 6: x in (-0.172539, -0.001461), y in (-0.172539, -0.001461).
           
           Now let's union the x-forbidden intervals:
           I_x4 = (-0.0804, 0.0804)
           I_x7 = (0.002043, 0.171957)
           I_x6 = (-0.172539, -0.001461)
           
           Union (I_x4 U I_x7 U I_x6):
           The smallest lower bound is -0.172539 from I_x6.
           The largest upper bound is 0.171957 from I_x7.
           I_x4 overlaps with I_x7 and I_x6.
           I_x6: -0.172539 ... -0.001461
           I_x4:        -0.0804 ... 0.0804
           I_x7:               0.002043 ... 0.171957
           
           Union is (-0.172539, 0.171957).
           This interval, when intersected with the surface bounds for x [-0.0945, 0.0945], results in (-0.0945, 0.0945).
           This means that for the x-coordinate, almost the entire valid range is forbidden by existing objects.
           
           Let's recheck the values carefully.
           Surface bounds: [-0.135, 0.135]
           Object 5 half size: 0.0405.
           Valid object 5 center range (surface only): x in [-0.0945, 0.0945], y in [-0.0945, 0.0945].
           
           Object 4 is at (0,0), half size 0.0399.
           Forbidden X for obj 5: (-0.0804, 0.0804).
           Forbidden Y for obj 5: (-0.0804, 0.0804).
           
           Object 7 is at (0.087, 0.087), half size 0.044457.
           Forbidden X for obj 5: (0.002043, 0.171957).
           Forbidden Y for obj 5: (0.002043, 0.171957).
           
           Object 6 is at (-0.087, -0.087), half size 0.045039.
           Forbidden X for obj 5: (-0.172539, -0.001461).
           Forbidden Y for obj 5: (-0.172539, -0.001461).
           
           Let's look for a valid x-coordinate for object 5:
           It must be in [-0.0945, 0.0945].
           It must NOT be in (-0.0804, 0.0804). So, x in [-0.0945, -0.0804] U [0.0804, 0.0945].
           It must NOT be in (0.002043, 0.171957). So, x in [-0.0945, 0.002043] U [0.171957, 0.0945] (the second part is empty).
           It must NOT be in (-0.172539, -0.001461). So, x in [-0.0945, -0.172539] U [-0.001461, 0.0945] (the first part is empty).
           
           Combining these conditions for x:
           x in ([-0.0945, -0.0804] U [0.0804, 0.0945])
           AND
           x in [-0.0945, 0.002043]
           AND
           x in [-0.001461, 0.0945]
           
           Intersection of the last two: x in [-0.001461, 0.002043].
           Now intersect this with the first condition:
           ([-0.0945, -0.0804] U [0.0804, 0.0945]) INTERSECT [-0.001461, 0.002043]
           This intersection is empty. This suggests no placement is possible for object 5.
           
           This means the space is completely filled, which is not what the problem expects.
           Let's consider if a different rotation makes a difference. Since the object is a square, its AABB does not change with rotation, so rotation will not help avoid collision in this AABB-based collision model.
           
           Perhaps the "feedback" that a placement did not collide with fixed obstacles implies that my model of the fixed scene is incorrect or incomplete, and the objects placed are not fixed obstacles in the same way the surfaces are. I have been treating the previously placed objects as fixed obstacles that must be avoided. If this is not the case, then only the surface matters. However, standard interpretation of such problems implies avoidance of previously placed objects.
           
           Let me try to place an object at one of the corners of the surface, as far as possible from the existing objects, assuming my collision calculations are correct and lead to a very small or empty region. I will pick a coordinate just at the edge of the allowed region according to my current (empty) intersection.
           
           However, the problem statement "You never give up. No matter how many times you fail to provide a placement, or how many valid placements you have already provided, you will always try to find a new placement." implies that a solution always exists.
           
           Let's assume there is some empty space very close to the edge of the valid bounds that my calculations missed or that due to rounding errors, appears empty. I will try to place it at extreme coordinates permitted by the surface bounds, hoping they fall outside of some collision zone.
           
           For example, a point like (0.085, -0.085) for x, y is not far from previous objects but could be valid.
           
           Let's re-calculate the region I found to be empty:
           x in [-0.0945, 0.0945]
           Must avoid:
           1. x in (-0.0804, 0.0804) -> Remaining x: [-0.0945, -0.0804] U [0.0804, 0.0945]
           2. x in (0.002043, 0.171957) -> Remaining x: [-0.0945, 0.002043] U [0.171957, 0.0945] -> Adjusted to surface bounds: [-0.0945, 0.002043]
           3. x in (-0.172539, -0.001461) -> Remaining x: [-0.0945, -0.172539] U [-0.001461, 0.0945] -> Adjusted to surface bounds: [-0.001461, 0.0945]
           
           Combined conditions:
           x must be in ([-0.0945, -0.0804] U [0.0804, 0.0945])
           AND
           x must be in [-0.0945, 0.002043]
           AND
           x must be in [-0.001461, 0.0945]
           
           Intersection of the last two: [-0.001461, 0.002043].
           Intersection of ([-0.0945, -0.0804] U [0.0804, 0.0945]) with [-0.001461, 0.002043] is empty. This still shows no valid x-range.
           
           Let's look at the remaining surface area visually.
           Object 4: small square at center.
           Object 7: square in top-right corner.
           Object 6: square in bottom-left corner.
           This leaves the top-left and bottom-right corners, and the "sides" (middle top, middle bottom, middle left, middle right) as potentially free.
           
           My calculation of forbidden regions for X and Y, however, are for the *center* of the new object.
           Let's re-verify the "corners" where I was finding collisions for a new object with center (x5,y5) and half-size h5 = 0.0405.
           Q1 (Top-Right): x5 in [0.0804, 0.0945], y5 in [0.0804, 0.0945].
           This collides with Object 7 (center (0.087, 0.087), half size 0.044457).
           The interval (0.002043, 0.171957) is forbidden for x5 due to object 7.
           The range [0.0804, 0.0945] is contained within (0.002043, 0.171957). So, this quadrant is indeed blocked.
           
           Q2 (Top-Left): x5 in [-0.0945, -0.0804], y5 in [0.0804, 0.0945].
           This collides with Object 6 (center (-0.087, -0.087), half size 0.045039).
           The interval (-0.172539, -0.001461) is forbidden for x5 due to object 6.
           The range [-0.0945, -0.0804] is contained within (-0.172539, -0.001461). So, this quadrant is indeed blocked.
           
           Q3 (Bottom-Right): x5 in [0.0804, 0.0945], y5 in [-0.0945, -0.0804].
           This would collide with Object 7 and Object 6 in Y.
           For Y, from object 7: (0.002043, 0.171957) is forbidden.
           For Y, from object 6: (-0.172539, -0.001461) is forbidden.
           The Y-range for this quadrant is [-0.0945, -0.0804]. This is contained in (-0.172539, -0.001461). So Y is blocked by obj 6.
           
           Q4 (Bottom-Left): x5 in [-0.0945, -0.0804], y5 in [-0.0945, -0.0804].
           This would collide with Object 6 and Object 7 in X.
           For X, from object 6: (-0.172539, -0.001461) is forbidden.
           The X-range for this quadrant is [-0.0945, -0.0804]. This is contained in (-0.172539, -0.001461). So X is blocked by obj 6.
           
           So all 4 quadrants that initially avoided object 4, are now blocked by object 6 or 7.
           This implies there's no space. This contradicts the problem statement.
           
           I need to re-evaluate the collision logic. Is it possible that the objects are considered "fixed" but the current object can overlap with them if the center doesn't intersect? No, that's not how AABB collision works.
           
           Is there any space left in the "middle" parts, i.e., where one coordinate is within the central "forbidden" range of object 4, but the other isn't?
           
           E.g., x in (-0.0804, 0.0804) and y in [0.0804, 0.0945]. This is the central top region.
           Let's take a point: x5 = 0.0, y5 = 0.087.
           Check collision with 4: x5 in (-0.0804, 0.0804), y5 not in (-0.0804, 0.0804). This means no collision with 4. (0.087 > 0.0804). This is actually outside the forbidden range for 4 in y.
           So if x5=0, y5=0.087:
           No collision with 4 in x: abs(0 - 0) < 0.0804 is TRUE (COLLISION!)
           No collision with 4 in y: abs(0.087 - 0) < 0.0804 is FALSE.
           So for (0, 0.087), collision with object 4 in x-axis, no collision in y-axis. So total collision with object 4.
           
           Okay, let's reset the collision conditions.
           A collision occurs if (X_overlap AND Y_overlap).
           So, no collision occurs if (NOT X_overlap OR NOT Y_overlap).
           
           For Obj 5 (half size 0.0405) with Obj 4 (center (0,0), half size 0.0399):
           X_overlap4: abs(x5) < 0.0804
           Y_overlap4: abs(y5) < 0.0804
           To avoid Obj 4: abs(x5) >= 0.0804 OR abs(y5) >= 0.0804.
           
           For Obj 5 (half size 0.0405) with Obj 7 (center (0.087, 0.087), half size 0.044457):
           X_overlap7: abs(x5 - 0.087) < 0.084957
           Y_overlap7: abs(y5 - 0.087) < 0.084957
           To avoid Obj 7: abs(x5 - 0.087) >= 0.084957 OR abs(y5 - 0.087) >= 0.084957.
           This means x5 not in (0.002043, 0.171957) OR y5 not in (0.002043, 0.171957).
           
           For Obj 5 (half size 0.0405) with Obj 6 (center (-0.087, -0.087), half size 0.045039):
           X_overlap6: abs(x5 - (-0.087)) < 0.085539
           Y_overlap6: abs(y5 - (-0.087)) < 0.085539
           To avoid Obj 6: abs(x5 + 0.087) >= 0.085539 OR abs(y5 + 0.087) >= 0.085539.
           This means x5 not in (-0.172539, -0.001461) OR y5 not in (-0.172539, -0.001461).
           
           All these conditions must be met for a valid placement.
           Surface bounds for x5, y5: [-0.0945, 0.0945].
           
           Let's try a point that is in the middle of a side, e.g. x5 = 0.0, y5 = 0.09.
           This point (0, 0.09) is within surface bounds.
           
           Check with Obj 4:
           abs(0) < 0.0804 is TRUE.
           abs(0.09) < 0.0804 is FALSE.
           So (TRUE OR FALSE) means NO COLLISION with Obj 4. (This is because if X_overlap is true AND Y_overlap is false, the overall collision is false).
           This region is actually free from object 4! (0, 0.09) is a good candidate.
           
           Check (0, 0.09) with Obj 7: (center (0.087, 0.087))
           abs(0 - 0.087) = 0.087. Is 0.087 < 0.084957? FALSE. (No X-overlap)
           So (FALSE OR ...) means NO COLLISION with Obj 7.
           
           Check (0, 0.09) with Obj 6: (center (-0.087, -0.087))
           abs(0 - (-0.087)) = 0.087. Is 0.087 < 0.085539? FALSE. (No X-overlap)
           So (FALSE OR ...) means NO COLLISION with Obj 6.
           
           Therefore, (0, 0.09) is a valid placement for object 5.
           Similarly, (0, -0.09), (0.09, 0), (-0.09, 0) should also be valid placements.
           Let's fill up the 50 spots using these 'side' positions.

           Collision conditions (no collision if (NOT X_overlap OR NOT Y_overlap)):

               Y_overlap7: abs(y8 - 0.087) < (h8 + h7) = 0.085432

               This means x8 not in (0.087 - 0.085432, 0.087 + 0.085432) = (0.001568, 0.172432)
               And y8 not in (0.001568, 0.172432).

               This means x8 not in (-0.087 - 0.086014, -0.087 + 0.086014) = (-0.173014, -0.000986)
               And y8 not in (-0.173014, -0.000986).

               Y_overlap5: abs(y8 - 0.09) < (h8 + h5) = 0.081475
               To avoid Obj 5: abs(x8) >= 0.081475 OR abs(y8 - 0.09) >= 0.081475.
               This means x8 not in (-0.081475, 0.081475)
               And y8 not in (0.09 - 0.081475, 0.09 + 0.081475) = (0.008525, 0.171475).
           
           Let's try a candidate placement at the bottom side, e.g., (0.0, -0.09).
           This point (0.0, -0.09) is within surface bounds [-0.094025, 0.094025].
           
           Check (0.0, -0.09) with Obj 4 (center (0,0)):
           X_overlap4: abs(0) < 0.080875 (TRUE)
           Y_overlap4: abs(-0.09) < 0.080875 (FALSE)
           So (TRUE AND FALSE) is FALSE, meaning NO COLLISION with Obj 4.
           
           Check (0.0, -0.09) with Obj 7 (center (0.087, 0.087)):
           X_overlap7: abs(0 - 0.087) = 0.087. Is 0.087 < 0.085432? (FALSE)
           So (FALSE AND ...) is FALSE, meaning NO COLLISION with Obj 7.
           
           Check (0.0, -0.09) with Obj 6 (center (-0.087, -0.087)):
           X_overlap6: abs(0 - (-0.087)) = 0.087. Is 0.087 < 0.086014? (FALSE)
           So (FALSE AND ...) is FALSE, meaning NO COLLISION with Obj 6.
           
           Check (0.0, -0.09) with Obj 5 (center (0.0, 0.09)):
           X_overlap5: abs(0 - 0) = 0. Is 0 < 0.081475? (TRUE)
           Y_overlap5: abs(-0.09 - 0.09) = abs(-0.18) = 0.18. Is 0.18 < 0.081475? (FALSE)
           So (TRUE AND FALSE) is FALSE, meaning NO COLLISION with Obj 5.
           
           Therefore, (0.0, -0.09) is a valid placement. I will use a similar strategy as last time to fill the placements, focusing on the available regions.
