           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` onto object `v20`.  My understanding of `on` is rooted in the axiom that if an object is *supported* at a specific pose and is actually *at* that pose, then it's "on" something.  I checked the initial state.  Each of the target objects is currently "on" `v11` because they're supported by `v11` at their current poses.  They're also all *potentially* supported by `v20` at pose `#o2`.  So, the crux of the problem lies in manipulating their `atpose` states.
           
           Specifically, I need to get each object to `atpose(#o2)`. Since the initial pose is `v9`, `v13`, `v15`, `v17`, and `v19` for each object.  That seems like a standard pick-and-place operation is required.
           
           Now, here's the catch.  The *only* action at my disposal is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This just shifts the robot's base configuration.  It doesn't directly influence the `atpose` predicates of any of the objects.  After running the move action, the `canmove()` predicate is also set to false. However, actions such as pick and place require `canmove()`.
           
           The issue is that there are no pick or place actions available.  If those actions were available, I could move the objects. Since my plan is dependent on having those `pick` and `place` actions that modify `atpose`. But I am explicitly forbidden from utilizing any other actions. Therefore, the goal state is unreachable in the current planning environment, at least as it's defined.
