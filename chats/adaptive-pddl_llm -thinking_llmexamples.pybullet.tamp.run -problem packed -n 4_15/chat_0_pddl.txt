(Thoughts: **The Path to Placement: A Plan for Object Relocation**
           
           My primary objective is to develop a plan that achieves the following: placing objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto receptacle `v18`. Currently, all these objects rest upon `v11`.
           
           To achieve this, I will construct a sequence of actions. I will leverage the robot's arm, denoted as `v4`, to perform both the pick-up and placement of each object. A key assumption is that specific, continuous parameters such as grasps (`#o1`), target poses (`#o2`), and kinematic trajectories (represented by `#t` values) are accessible.
           
           The proposed plan is structured as follows:
           
           1.  **Object `v8`:** The plan will begin by executing `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #t1)`. The parameter `#t1` is assumed to be computable. This will grasp `v8` from its current pose `v9`. After picking, the plan will then include `(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #t2)`. The `#t2` parameter will denote the placement of the object on `v18` at the predetermined target pose `#o2`.
           
           2.  **Object `v12`:** A similar sequence will be used for object `v12`. First, the sequence `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #t3)` is executed to pick up the object from its initial pose. Second, a placement `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #t4)` onto `v18` occurs.
           
           3.  **Object `v14`:** The next set of actions concern object `v14`. This includes a pick operation `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #t5)` from `v15`, and a placement using the action `(place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #t6)`.
           
           4.  **Object `v16`:** Finally, to move object `v16` onto `v18`, the pick action `(pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #t7)` is followed by a place `(place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #t8)`.
           
           It's imperative to recognize that the kinematic parameters are essential to fulfill the preconditions of both `pick` and `place` actions. The `atbconf(v3)` condition is met throughout the plan, as no base movement is required or available.
           The `handempty(v4)` precondition is also maintained as the actions are interleaved to maintain an arm empty state before each pick operation. The goal predicate `on(object, v18)` will be satisfied after each pair of pick/place.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #t1), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #t2), (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #t3), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #t4), (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #t5), (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #t6), (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #t7), (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #t8)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Goal is Impossible with the Provided Actions**
           
           Okay, I understand. The previous plan had a fatal flaw: it included `pick` and `place` actions with continuous parameters, which are now clearly disallowed. The only permissible action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This means I'm severely constrained.
           
           My ultimate goal is to get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto object `v18`. Initially, all these objects are resting on `v11`.  The way I achieve "on" is through the `supported` and `atpose` predicates.  Essentially, I need to get each object positioned correctly.
           
           However, with only `move_base v3 v3 #o0` at my disposal, I can't do anything to change the "on" state. The robot can move, but only to *stay* in the same location (v3).  I need `pick` and `place` actions to actually *move* the objects and modify their positions (defined by `atpose`). The situation right now is that `v8` could be on `v18` if it was in pose `#o2`, but there's no way to get it there, so I'm stuck.
           
           With the given action constraints, I'm forced to conclude that the goal is unattainable.
