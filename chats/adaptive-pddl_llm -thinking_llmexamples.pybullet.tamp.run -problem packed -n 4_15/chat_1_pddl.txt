               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Analysis and Unreachability**
           
           My primary goal is to determine a plan to achieve the target configuration: all objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`) resting on `v18`. This translates to placing these objects at their respective poses on `v18`. I begin by analyzing the initial state, noting the location of each object on `v11`.  The robot has two arms, with `v4` having associated kinematics facts.  The available action is `move_base v3 v3 #o0` which is a no-op but important for making actions *available*.
           
           The critical actions for object manipulation, `pick` and `place`, are implied by `kin` facts.  These facts detail the robot's capabilities to pick and place objects, specifying grasps and trajectories. A crucial observation is that a common pose `#o2` exists for all target placements on `v18`. This greatly simplifies the plan conceptually.
           
           My initial plan was straightforward: pick each object from its current location on `v11`, and place it at pose `#o2` on `v18`, using arm `v4`. The `kin` facts validate these pick and place actions, and the required preconditions appeared to be met.
           
           However, a closer inspection of the constraints revealed a critical issue. The problem statement explicitly restricts valid actions to those listed. The only provided valid action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This implies that *only* this action can be used in the plan. All pick and place actions, even those suggested by the `kin` facts, are *not* explicitly listed.  
           
           Given this restriction, I must conclude that the goal state is unreachable. Since no pick or place actions are valid, objects cannot be moved from their initial locations to `v18`, which is the very objective of the problem. This is due to the very specific definition of valid action instances. Therefore, despite the presence of kinematics facts enabling manipulation, the problem instance, as stated, presents an unachievable goal.
