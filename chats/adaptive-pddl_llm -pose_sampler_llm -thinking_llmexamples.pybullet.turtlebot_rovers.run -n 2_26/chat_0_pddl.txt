User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Finding Optimal Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with locating three suitable (x, y) coordinates for the robot bases around a target point, which in this case is (-1.0, -1.0). The bases need to be within a 2-unit radius of the target, and obviously, the x and y coordinates need to fall within the scene's dimensions, from -2.5 to 2.5. Furthermore, since the robots will automatically orient themselves towards the target, I need to ensure clear line-of-sight and avoid collisions with all the fixed obstacles within the environment. I've also noted that if a position fails multiple times, it is likely invalid.
           
           My initial approach focuses on parsing the provided environment: It's a rectangular room divided by a vertical wall at x=0. The target is firmly in the room's left half (x < 0). It is important to remember that since the robot must be in the left half, I should make sure that the base position I pick is, too.
           
           I started by carefully identifying and analyzing the relevant obstacles in the left half of the room. I analyzed Obstacle 5 which is the dividing wall, Obstacle 6 - a rectangle to the bottom left, Obstacle 8 - the square at the top, Obstacle 10 - a square at the top right, Obstacle 11 - a small rectangle in the bottom left, Obstacle 13 - a small box in the left middle, Obstacle 14 - a box in the bottom left, and finally, Obstacle 16 - a rectangle near the central wall.
           
           For the first candidate, I'm proposing `(-1.0, 0.5)`, positioned above the target. After performing a series of sanity checks like checking the distance and room bounds constraints, I had to be sure that the obstacles don't block the line of sight.
           
           For my second position, I chose `(-0.5, -1.0)`, located to the right of the target. Then, after making sure to stay on the correct side of the center wall (x < -0.05), I checked for collisions again. I found that I need to be careful of Obstacle 16, but after the check it was found that the path was clear.
           
           Thirdly, I opted for `(-1.0, -2.4)`, positioned below the target, and after the same series of checks and obstacle checks, the position appeared to be okay.
           
           After carefully assessing these three positions, I'm confident they are viable options. They satisfy all constraints, avoid obstacles, maintain line of sight, and offer diversity in location around the target.
