           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` goal, which implies several conditions related to images, analyses, and free storage. We have two rovers, v12 and v14, each with a camera v10 and a store v16. Both rovers are currently at a specific configuration, v13 for v12 and v15 for v14. The goal requires having received images for v17, v18, v19, and v20 using mode v11, and having received analysis for rock types v2 (stone) and v6 (soil).
           
           Let's break down the `new-axiom@0()` goal:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is true initially.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is true initially.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: This is true initially.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: This is true initially.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           7. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           8. `receivedimage(v20, v11)`
           9. `type(?stone, v2)`: `v1` and `v4` are type `v2`. `v3` is type `v2`.
           10. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: Need to analyze `v1`, `v3` or `v4`.
           11. `type(?soil, v6)`: `v5`, `v7` and `v8` are type `v6`.
           12. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: Need to analyze `v5`, `v7` or `v8`.
           
           The available actions are very limited: `move`, `drop_rock`. This means we cannot take images, calibrate, send images, sample rocks, or send analysis.
           Since the required `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates are not initially true and cannot be achieved with the given available actions, the goal is unreachable.
           
           --Plan--:
           The goal is not achievable because the available actions are limited to `move` and `drop_rock`. These actions cannot fulfill the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates required by the `new-axiom@0()` goal. Actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` are missing from the list of allowed actions.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `The goal is not achievable because the available actions are limited to `move` and `drop_rock`. These actions cannot fulfill the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates required by the `new-axiom@0()`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The previous response incorrectly attempted to provide an explanation for an unreachable goal while still including the `--Plan--:` heading. Given the constraint that only the explicitly listed action instances are allowed, and these instances are `move` and `drop_rock`, it is impossible to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This goal requires several `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates to be true, which are effects of actions like `send_image` and `send_analysis` respectively. These actions are not in the list of allowed actions. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires several conditions to be met, including `receivedimage` for multiple objectives and `receivedanalysis` for different types of rocks. Looking at the available actions:
           1. `move v12 v13 #o2 v13`: This action moves rover v12 from configuration v13 to v13 (effectively staying in place) and has no effect on images or analyses.
           2. `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`: This action moves rover v14 from configuration v15 to v15 (effectively staying in place) and has no effect on images or analyses.
           3. `drop_rock v12 v16`: This action changes the state of store v16 for rover v12 from `full` to `free`. However, initially, `free(v12, v16)` is true, so this action has no meaningful effect unless a rock was previously sampled (which is not possible with available actions). Even if it were to become full, dropping a rock does not contribute to `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           4. `drop_rock v14 v16`: Similar to the previous action, this changes the state of store v16 for rover v14 from `full` to `free`. Initially, `free(v14, v16)` is true.
           
           The goal requires predicates such as `receivedimage(?o, ?m)` and `receivedanalysis(?r)`. The allowed actions cannot achieve these predicates. There are no actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` in the provided list of valid action instances. Therefore, the goal is unreachable given the severely restricted set of allowed actions.
