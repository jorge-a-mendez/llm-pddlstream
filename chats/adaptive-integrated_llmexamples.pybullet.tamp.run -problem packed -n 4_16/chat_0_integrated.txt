User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.108, 0.484), (0.194, 0.57)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.274, -0.111), (-0.192, -0.029)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.188, -0.527), (0.286, -0.429)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.102, -0.332), (0.192, -0.241)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.151, 0.527, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.605, 0.797).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.233, -0.07, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.996, 0.093).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.237, -0.478, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.896, -0.445).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.147, -0.287, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.983, 0.186).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) that need to be moved to the surface v18. Currently, these objects are on surface v11. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, both of which are empty. The only available action instance is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, which means the robot's base can move from its current configuration v3 to the same configuration v3 using a trajectory #o0. This essentially means the robot can remain in its current base configuration.
           
           Since there are no pick and place actions available in the action instances list, and the goal requires moving objects, the goal is not achievable.
