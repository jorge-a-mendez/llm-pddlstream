User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.108, 0.484), (0.194, 0.57)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.274, -0.111), (-0.192, -0.029)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.188, -0.527), (0.286, -0.429)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.102, -0.332), (0.192, -0.241)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.151, 0.527, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.605, 0.797).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.233, -0.07, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.996, 0.093).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.237, -0.478, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.896, -0.445).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.147, -0.287, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.983, 0.186).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

Model:     The scene describes a PR2 robot with two arms, v4 and v6. Currently, v4 is at arm configuration v5 and v6 is at arm configuration v7. The robot's base is at configuration v3. There are several objects in the scene: v8, v12, v14, and v16. These objects are all `graspable` and `stackable`. They are currently located at specific poses on surface v11. The goal is to place all of these objects on surface v18.
           
           The initial state shows that objects v8, v12, v14, and v16 are currently on surface v11. Specifically:
           - v8 is at pose v9, supported by v11.
           - v12 is at pose v13, supported by v11.
           - v14 is at pose v15, supported by v11.
           - v16 is at pose v17, supported by v11.
           
           The goal is to have all these objects on surface v18. The available actions include `pick` and `place` actions using arm v4, along with `move_base` actions. Since all objects are currently on v11 and need to be moved to v18, a sequence of pick and place operations for each object will be required. The robot arm v4 is capable of interacting with all the objects. I will use the shared pose #o2 to place the objects on v18.
           
           I will iterate through each object, picking it up from its current pose on v11 and placing it onto the target surface v18 at a new pose. Since `supported(?o, #o2, v18)` is in the initial state for all objects, I will use #o2 as the target pose on v18. I need to compute the continuous values for #o2 for each object.

Since `supported(?o, #o2, v18)` is in the initial state for all objects, I will use #o2 as the target pose on v18. I need to compute the continuous values for #o2 for each object. The surface v18 has an AABB of ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). I need to ensure that the objects are placed within these bounds. The objects have different AABBs, so their center coordinates will vary slightly to ensure they are contained within the surface. The object sizes are:
           - v8: ((0.108, 0.484), (0.194, 0.57)) - This is its initial position, not its own AABB. Its own AABB can be estimated as a small square. Assuming a small cube of side length ~0.07.
           - v12: ((0.102, -0.332), (0.192, -0.241)) - Assuming a small cube of side length ~0.09.
           - v14: ((0.188, -0.527), (0.286, -0.429)) - Assuming a small cube of side length ~0.09.
           - v16: ((-0.274, -0.111), (-0.192, -0.029)) - Assuming a small cube of side length ~0.08.
           
           Let's assume the objects are roughly cubic with a side length of around 0.07m to 0.09m. For simplicity, let's use a conservative estimate of a 0.07m side for all. To be stable on v18 (AABB of side 0.27m), the center of the objects should be between -0.135 + (0.07/2) and 0.135 - (0.07/2), which is roughly -0.1 and 0.1.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', v34) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The scene describes a PR2 robot with two arms, v4 and v6. Currently, v4 is at arm configuration v5 and v6 is at arm configuration v7. The robot's base is at configuration v3. There are several objects in the scene: v8, v12, v14, and v16. These objects are all `graspable` and `stackable`. They are currently located at specific poses on surface v11. The goal is to place all of these objects on surface v18.
           
           The initial state shows that objects v8, v12, v14, and v16 are currently on surface v11. Specifically:
           - v8 is at pose v9, supported by v11.
           - v12 is at pose v13, supported by v11.
           - v14 is at pose v15, supported by v11.
           - v16 is at pose v17, supported by v11.
           
           The goal is to have all these objects on surface v18. The available actions include `pick` and `place` actions using arm v4, along with `move_base` actions. Since all objects are currently on v11 and need to be moved to v18, a sequence of pick and place operations for each object will be required. The robot arm v4 is capable of interacting with all the objects. I will use the shared pose #o2 to place the objects on v18.
           
           The previous error "Precondition fact ('atbconf', v34) is not satisfied!" indicates that `atbconf` was not maintained. Looking at the action instances, `pick` and `place` both require `atbconf(#o3)`. The initial state has `atbconf(v3)`. Therefore, I need to include a `move_base` action to change the base configuration from `v3` to `#o3` before the pick/place actions and then potentially move back if needed. The available `move_base` actions include moving between `v3` and `#o3`.
           
           Let's assume a move to `#o3` is required to perform the pick and place actions.
           The surface v18 has an AABB of ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). I need to ensure that the objects are placed within these bounds. Assuming object sizes are small enough to fit within v18. For instance, assuming objects are cubes of side 0.07m.
