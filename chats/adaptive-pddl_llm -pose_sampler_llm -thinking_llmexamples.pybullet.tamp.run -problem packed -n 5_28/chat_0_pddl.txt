(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Placements for Object ID 4 on Surface 0**
           
           As an expert in scene geometry and object placement, my goal is to provide 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 4, dimensions 0.0726106206817261 x 0.0726106206817261) on a square surface (Surface 0: -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y). Since the object is square, rotations simplify to effective bounding box extents repeating every pi/2. I'll utilize a systematic approach to ensure diversity in object position and orientation, covering different states of rotation.
           
           For each rotation angle (theta) from 0 to 5pi/4 using some of them, I calculate the effective bounding box dimensions. Since the object is square (obj_w=obj_h), the effective side is calculated as: `effective_side = obj_w * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This side determines the valid range for the object's center coordinates (x, y).
           
           The valid range for x: `[surf_lower_x + effective_side / 2, surf_upper_x - effective_side / 2]`
           
           The valid range for y: `[surf_lower_y + effective_side / 2, surf_upper_y - effective_side / 2]`
           
           I generate a grid of positions within these ranges for each rotation, choosing three points to use for x values and three for y values. This method ensures a good coverage of valid locations across various orientations. I will keep the positions consistent for the different rotations for a stable scene. I will output the placements as `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`.

(Thoughts: **Collision Detection and Placement Strategy for Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've got this feedback on object 4's successful placement, and that placement is at `(surf_idx=0, theta=0.0, x=-0.09869468965913693, y=-0.09869468965913693)`.  Now I'm focusing on placing object 5, which is a square with side length `0.09641641002744528`, within the same surface.  The key challenge here is to avoid collisions, especially with the already placed object 4, which is a square of side length `0.07261062068172613`.  I know that surface bounds for surface 0 are defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           I've determined that object 4's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) is defined by `[(-0.135, -0.135), (-0.06238937931827386, -0.06238937931827386)]`. I'll define `obj4_bbox = [(-0.135, -0.135), (-0.06238937931827386, -0.06238937931827386)]`.
           
           Now, for object 5, the rotation angle `theta` matters, and its effective side length for collision calculations is `effective_s5 = obj5_s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. I'm going to start by generating placements, focusing on key rotation angles `0`, `pi/4`, `pi/2`, `3pi/4`, `pi`, `5pi/4`. Then, for each potential placement, I'll calculate the object 5 AABB and check for overlap with object 4. If there's overlap, I'll discard the position.
           
           Let's start by looking for viable positions with a rotation angle `theta = 0.0`. In this case, I will calculate the `x` and `y` range for valid positions and, for each pair, calculate an object 5 AABB. I will then perform a collision check. I can define a method to check collision. The calculations confirm that a simple grid based approach may not work. I also needed to divide the range in more sub ranges. It turns out that three pairs are valid for theta=0, so, I did the same calculation and, for `theta = pi/4`, it turns out three pairs are valid as well. I need 50, so I can reuse theta values and find some.
           
           I am using `0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2` and `pi/4, 3pi/4, 5pi/4, 7pi/4` (4 groups of theta).
           I calculate the values and obtain the number of combinations, with this approach it is possible to achieve 50 placements. I list out those positions and I am finished.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Placing a New Object**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with placing 50 stable instances of a new object (ID 7) on Surface 0, making sure I don't run into the two objects already there (IDs 4 and 5). Here's how I'm thinking of tackling this:
           
           1.  **Define the Problem:** First things first, I've got to understand the playing field. I've got the dimensions of Surface 0, which gives me my boundary conditions: `-0.135` to `0.135` for both X and Y. I've got the bounding boxes (AABBs) of the two obstacles already present. Object 4's bounding box is roughly in the bottom-left corner, and Object 5 is to its right, a bit above.
           
           2.  **Rotation Considerations:** The new object can be rotated, and I need to account for how that affects its bounding box. I'll need to calculate the effective half-side length for each rotation I'm considering. The trick is to rotate a square; the effective bounding box will have its maximum AABB if rotated 45 degrees, which I need to compute.
           
           3.  **Candidate Placement Generation:** I'll set up a grid of potential locations within the surface boundaries. First, I'll identify the valid center range for the new object given a rotation, ensuring I don't go outside the bounds of Surface 0. Then, I'll generate candidates across that range. I'll test rotations of 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi, 5pi/4, 3pi/2, and 7pi/4 radians.
           
           4.  **Collision Detection:** This is the core of the strategy. For each candidate location and rotation, I'll calculate the new object's AABB. Then, I'll check for any overlap (collision) between this new AABB and the AABBs of the existing obstacles. A simple bounding-box check using the `collide_bboxes` function should do the trick.
           
           5.  **Filter and Return:** I'll filter the candidate placements, only keeping the ones that don't collide with anything. I will store the information: (surface index, theta, x\_center, y\_center). Once I've found 50 non-colliding, stable placements, I can wrap it up. I'll increase the grid density or add more angles if I can't find 50.
           
           I've got the code ready. I'll make sure to double-check my calculations and collision logic. It should be pretty straightforward, and I'm confident I can find a good set of placements!
