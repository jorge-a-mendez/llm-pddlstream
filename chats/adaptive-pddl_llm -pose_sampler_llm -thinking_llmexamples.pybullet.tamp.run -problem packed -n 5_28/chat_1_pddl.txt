           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v14, v20)

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Impossibility of Reaching the Goal**
           
           Okay, I've got a problem. The goal is to get several objects – v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18 – "on" v20.  Right now, they're all "atpose" on v11, supported by v11, and that translates to being "on" v11.  The fundamental issue is the actions available. All I have is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action doesn't change anything about where objects are supported or what pose they have.
           
           To make an object "on" something, I need to manipulate its "atpose" and ensure the correct "supported" relationship. Specifically, for v8 to be on v20, it needs a pose where it's supported by v20, which I do know exists (#o2). The problem is I need to be able to pick up v8 from its current pose on v11, and place it down on v20. I can't do that with just `move_base`.
           
           The `pick` and `place` actions are completely missing. Without them, I can't alter the `atpose` facts.  Therefore, I'm stuck and the goal is fundamentally unreachable given these action instances. No matter what, I can't pick up or place any object.
