User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a central vertical obstacle at x = 0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered around the scene, including some in the corners, near the central vertical obstacle, and in other various locations.
           
           For the target point (1.78 0.47), I will aim for positions within a circle of radius 2 centered at (1.78 0.47). I'll prioritize positions that are away from the known obstacles, especially the central x=0 wall. Given the target point is on the positive x side, I will focus on finding positions on the positive x side. I'll try to find positions to the left, right, and slightly in front or behind the target point to provide diversity.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The previous request was for a target point (-1.9867984056472778, 1.8676679134368896). My previous proposed positions were (1.0, 0.47), (1.78, -1.0), and (2.3, 0.47). All of these failed. The first two failed due to no line of sight, likely due to the central vertical wall at x=0. The last one collided with two obstacles, which is consistent with its location near the boundary and other small obstacles. This means I completely misjudged the side of the scene the target was on and made a critical mistake in my initial reasoning.
           
           For the current request, the target point is (-1.9867984056472778, 1.8676679134368896). This target is in the top-left quadrant of the scene. The central obstacle at x=0 is a major factor, so all positions must be on the left side (negative x) of this obstacle. I also need to be mindful of the obstacles in the top-left region: 6, 8, 19, 21.
           
           I will focus on positions within a radius of 2 from the target (-1.9867984056472778, 1.8676679134368896). I will try to place the robot in open areas in the top-left, avoiding the known obstacles.

Model:     The previous target point was (-1.9867984056472778, 1.8676679134368896). My previous proposals were (1.0, 0.47), (1.78, -1.0), and (2.3, 0.47), all of which failed due to being on the wrong side of the x=0 wall or colliding with fixed obstacles on the right side.
           
           For the subsequent request with the same target point, my proposals were (-1.0, 1.8), (-1.9, 0.5), and (-2.2, 1.0). I still need to see the feedback for these specific positions.
           
           Assuming this is a *new* target point for which I do not have feedback yet, I will proceed with the current request for the target point (-1.9867984056472778, 1.8676679134368896). Since I haven't received feedback for my *second* set of proposals, I will try some new diverse positions, still adhering to the x < 0 constraint and the max_range=2 constraint. I will consider the known obstacles in the top-left area.
           
           Known obstacles in the top-left:
           6: ((-2.4047, -2.3455502384913305), (-1.3952999999999998, -1.6544497615086693)) - Bottom-left-ish

           The target is at (-1.986, 1.867). Obstacles 8 and 19 are very close to the target, so I should place the robot slightly further away from those specific coordinates. I will try to use the area around the target, being mindful of these obstacles.

Model:     Okay, I've received feedback for the previous two target points.
           
           First, for target (-1.9867984056472778, 1.8676679134368896), I proposed (-1.0, 1.8), (-1.9, 0.5), and (-2.2, 1.0). The feedback for these was *not* provided in the current prompt, so I will assume they may have been valid or invalid for that target, but the provided failures are for the *next* target.
           
           The new target point is (0.5194946527481079, 2.1205742359161377). My previous proposals for this target were (-1.8, 1.0), (-1.5, 1.5), and (-2.4, 1.5).
           - (-1.8, 1.0) failed due to no line of sight. This is expected given the target is at x=0.5 and the robot was at x=-1.8, with the x=0 wall in between.
           - (-1.5, 1.5) also failed due to no line of sight, for the same reason.
           - (-2.4, 1.5) collided with obstacle 0, which is the left boundary wall at x=-2.45. This makes sense as -2.4 is very close to this wall.
           
           This tells me that my reasoning about being on the correct side of the x=0 wall was correct for *this* target point, but I chose positions on the *wrong* side of the wall. The target (0.519, 2.120) is on the positive x side (right side) of the central x=0 wall. Therefore, I need to place the robot base on the positive x side as well.
           
           I will focus on positions within a radius of 2 from (0.519, 2.120) and on the right side of the x=0 wall. I also need to be mindful of the obstacles in the top-right region:
           1: ((-2.55, 2.45), (2.55, 2.55)) - Top wall
           7: ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) - Top-right corner
           9: ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)) - Near target
           10: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)) - Near x=0 wall
           16: ((2.0293293620688186, 0.47611332193438866), (2.1624249790566696, 0.6092089389222397)) - Bottom-right
           17: ((0.23643267644684846, 0.6195126820926005), (0.3568252276058859, 0.7399052332516378)) - Mid-right
           20: ((2.050691999243101, 1.8378123414977396), (2.124188028527895, 1.9113083707825338)) - Top-right
           22: ((0.47149994795753036, 2.07257953112556), (0.5674893575386855, 2.1685689407067152)) - Very near target
           
           Obstacle 9 and 22 are very close to the target. I need to be careful not to collide with them or have line of sight blocked. I'll try positions slightly in front and behind the target (in y), and to the right (in x), keeping clear of obstacle 7 and 20 as well.

Model:     I have received the feedback for the previous two target points. It seems I made a mistake in interpreting the previous prompt. The failures provided were for the target point `(0.5194946527481079, 2.1205742359161377)` and my immediately previous set of proposals `(-1.8, 1.0)`, `(-1.5, 1.5)`, `(-2.4, 1.5)`. These all failed due to being on the wrong side of the x=0 obstacle or colliding with the left wall.
           
           Now, for the current request, the target point is `(0.5194946527481079, 2.1205742359161377)`. I am still working on this same target point, and I need to propose new positions.
           
           Based on the failures, I know the robot must be on the right side of the x=0 barrier. The target is in the top-right quadrant. My previous positions were:
           (1.0 1.5)
           (0.5 0.5)
           (1.5 2.0)
           
           I need to await feedback for these specific positions. Since I am given a new request for the *same* target point and *no feedback for my last set of proposals*, it implies that I need to provide new positions, but I don't have information about why the previous set (1.0 1.5), (0.5 0.5), (1.5 2.0) might have failed. I will generate a new set of positions for this target, making sure to stay on the right side of x=0 and within range 2.
           
           I'll review the obstacles in the vicinity of (0.519, 2.120):
           1: ((-2.55, 2.45), (2.55, 2.55)) - Top wall
           7: ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) - Top-right corner
           9: ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)) - Near target
           10: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)) - Near x=0 wall (not relevant if staying right of x=0)
           16: ((2.0293293620688186, 0.47611332193438866), (2.1624249790566696, 0.6092089389222397)) - Far bottom-right
           17: ((0.23643267644684846, 0.6195126820926005), (0.3568252276058859, 0.7399052332516378)) - Far bottom-left of target
           20: ((2.050691999243101, 1.8378123414977396), (2.124188028527895, 1.9113083707825338)) - Top-right
           22: ((0.47149994795753036, 2.07257953112556), (0.5674893575386855, 2.1685689407067152)) - *Very* near target, within obstacle 9.
           
           I need to be especially careful about obstacle 9 and 22, which are very close to the target. I'll try to move further away from these but still within max_range. I'll try positions slightly more to the right and also considering positions directly below the target.
