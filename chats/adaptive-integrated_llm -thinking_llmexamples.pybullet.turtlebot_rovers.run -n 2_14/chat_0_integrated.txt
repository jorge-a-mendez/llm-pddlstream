           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachability Analysis**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. This complex goal decomposes into several sub-goals, critically requiring the satisfaction of `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. To achieve these, the necessary actions are `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. However, upon meticulously reviewing the provided list of permissible action instances, it becomes glaringly apparent that none of these crucial actions are included.
           
           The allowed actions are limited to `move` and `drop_rock`. Furthermore, the `move` actions merely keep the rovers in place, not allowing movement to the required configurations. Given these extreme constraints, I can decisively conclude that achieving the ultimate goal, `new-axiom@0()`, is categorically impossible under the problem's defined rules. The requisite actions to satisfy the goal predicates are simply unavailable, making any viable plan unattainable. Consequently, the goal is deemed *unreachable*.
