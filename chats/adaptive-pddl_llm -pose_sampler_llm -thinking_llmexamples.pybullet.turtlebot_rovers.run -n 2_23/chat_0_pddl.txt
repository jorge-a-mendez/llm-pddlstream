           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis: The Goal is Unreachable**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. My goal is `new-axiom@0()`, but it boils down to achieving a conjunction of conditions: getting images (`receivedimage`), analyzing rocks and soil (`receivedanalysis`), and a few other initial conditions that are already true.
           
           The *core* of the problem is the image and analysis parts.  I've laid out the actions needed to get those: `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`.  But *here's* the snag: the problem *specifically limits* me to only using the actions listed: `move` and `drop_rock`. 
           
           Those two actions? They don't have *anything* to do with images or analysis! I've double-checked their preconditions and effects. `move` just changes the rover's location, and `drop_rock` just changes a rover's load status. It's a dead end.
           
           I carefully re-read the problem description, focusing on the constraint about the *only* valid action instances. It's a hard constraint. If I can't use `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`, then I *can't* achieve `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`. Those predicates are the *goal*!
           
           I tried to see if the axiom itself could somehow derive the goal predicates without an action, but that's not the case. The axiom *is* the goal, it just *defines* the conditions. It's not a rule that infers them from initial facts.
           
           Therefore, given the *strict* limitations on available actions, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is *unachievable*.  It's just not possible. I need to communicate this conclusion.
