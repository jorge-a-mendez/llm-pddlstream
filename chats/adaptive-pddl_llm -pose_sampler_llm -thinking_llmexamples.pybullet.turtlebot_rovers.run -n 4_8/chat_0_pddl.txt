User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Analyzing and Navigating a Tricky Target Point**
           
           My analysis begins with a seemingly impossible scenario: a target point, (0.0, 0.0), located *inside* a fixed obstacle (a vertical wall at x=0). Given standard definitions of line-of-sight and collision, this implies the target is inherently unviewable. However, the problem statement's insistence that I "never give up" forces me to explore creative interpretations. My primary assumption is that even though the target point *is* inside an obstacle, the system may employ a more lenient definition of line-of-sight. For instance, the system might be checking a line of sight to the *surface* of the obstacle, effectively `(0.05,0)` or `(-0.05,0)`.
           
           My approach focuses on generating three positions that comply with several constraints: they are within a 2-unit distance of the target, within the bounding box of [-2.5, 2.5] x [-2.5, 2.5], and do not collide with any fixed obstacle. Here is a breakdown of those points:
           
           1.  **(1.0, 0.0):** This position is set on the right side of the wall. Its distance to (0.0, 0.0) is 1.0, and it is located on the x-axis, facing directly at the target. This places it clearly on the right side of the "wall" and on a clear view.
           2.  **(-1.0, 0.0):** The second position is symmetrically across from the first. It is set on the left side of the "wall," looking directly at the target from across the other side. Distance is 1.0, with unobstructed line of site to the origin.
           3.  **(0.1, 1.0):** This position is placed at an angle. The point gives diversity to my set by being in a different quadrant. The distance is a little over 1 and it is at an angle, looking towards (0.0, 0.0).
           
           These positions are based on my assumption that if a target point is on the wall, the system provides line-of-sight to points near the target or on the visible surface, even if, technically, the ray passes very close to the obstacle. I will be ready to adjust my method given feedback, but this selection represents my best attempt to navigate a challenging, potentially impossible, scenario.
