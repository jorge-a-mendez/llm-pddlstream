           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unattainable: Confined Rovers and Configuration Mismatch**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of the problem. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunction of several conditions.  I've systematically analyzed each part and determined the plan is unachievable due to a fundamental constraint: **The rovers are stuck in their initial configurations, and that prevents any meaningful action.**
           
           First, let's consider the sub-goals related to image acquisition:  I need to get images of four specific objectives and send them (achieving the `receivedimage` predicates).  To do this, I must use `send_image`.  To use `send_image`, I need `haveimage`, and `comvisible` at the right configuration. To get `haveimage` I must use `take_image`, but `take_image` requires `imagevisible` at the right configuration, and I must calibrate the camera.  I need to use `calibrate`.
           
           Now, the problem. The initial state defines the rovers' current positions: `v12` is at `v13` and `v14` is at `v15`.  The critical issue is the `atconf` predicate's role in the action preconditions.  `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates are stated for specific configurations *other* than those where the rovers *are*. For example, image visibility is associated with configuration `#o3` and communication visibility with `#o0`.  The only permissible move actions are "no-ops" - moves that simply maintain the current configuration. I cannot maneuver the rovers to configurations that would allow image capture or communication (and therefore receiving the images).
           
           Similarly, to achieve the analysis goals ( `receivedanalysis` ), I need to use `send_analysis`, which has similar configuration requirements.  `send_analysis` relies on the `comvisible` predicate and the `atconf` predicate matching, I can't achieve this either. Sampling requires `above` at a different configuration and I cannot move.
           
           I must analyze rocks to complete this task. The only path here, if achievable, is to use `sample_rock`. The available actions explicitly prevent configuration changes. Therefore, rock sampling is impossible, and consequently, I can't satisfy the analysis goal.
           
           **In essence, the entire plan fails because the rovers are locked into their starting configurations, unable to reach the necessary positions to take images, communicate, or sample the rocks. The "move" actions I'm given are merely identity operations, meaning I'm stuck.** The actions I can utilize are insufficient for the goal's successful completion.
