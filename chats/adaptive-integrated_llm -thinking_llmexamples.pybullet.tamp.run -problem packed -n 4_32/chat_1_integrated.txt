           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Plan for Object Placement**
           
           My goal is to successfully place four objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) onto a designated surface, v18.  This necessitates a careful examination of the initial state, the available actions, and the constraints imposed by the environment.
           
           The current configuration presents these objects supported by v11, while the objective requires their relocation to v18. I've noted that v18 is a smaller surface than v11, hinting at the need for precision in my approach. The robot arm v4 is my primary tool, and it is currently empty.
           
           My chosen methodology involves a straightforward "pick and place" sequence for each object. For the robot arm to successfully move each object, the following process will take place:
           
           1.  **Pick:** Using arm `v4`, I'll grasp each object from its initial pose (v9 for v8, v13 for v12, v15 for v14, and v17 for v16).
           2.  **Place:** Subsequently, I'll place each object onto v18 at its designated pose. The object origins have the AABB's for each object. I'll need to define distinct poses for each object's placement on v18.
           
           Here's my rationale:
           
           *   **Continuous Parameters:** Several continuous parameters are present in this scenario. These parameters represent grasp points and base motions, but are not relevant to specifying poses.
           *   **Object Properties:** The AABB, or dimensions, of each object must be accounted for as I plan the placement. It is crucial to determine where to place the objects on v18.
           *   **Robot Constraints:** Since `kin` predicates define the constraints on the robot arm's movement and object manipulation, there are no concerns for collisions.
           
           Given my analysis, I am now ready to present my planned action sequence. The details include pick, and then place, of each object at their target location. For the placement of each object at the target location, the `#o2` pose must contain a specific coordinate that places the objects on v18 in a collision-free manner.
           
           The planned pose values:
           *   `(#o2 v8 v18): (-0.04 0.04 0.781 0.0)`
           *   `(#o2 v12 v18): (0.04 0.04 0.781 0.0)`
           *   `(#o2 v14 v18): (-0.04 -0.04 0.781 0.0)`
           *   `(#o2 v16 v18): (0.04 -0.04 0.781 0.0)`

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unattainability**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a very limited action space - just `move_base` from `v3` to `v3` with a specific trajectory.  Frankly, it's a bit odd.  My goal is to manipulate objects, specifically to get `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto `v18`.  That screams for `pick` and `place` actions, the bread and butter of this kind of task.  But, the only tool I've got is moving the base around a bit, which is essentially useless for object manipulation.  Given this constraint, I have to conclude that the goal is absolutely unreachable with the actions allowed. There's simply no way to bridge the gap between my starting state and the desired object configurations with the limited toolkit I've been given. It's a fundamental mismatch between the problem and the allowed actions.
