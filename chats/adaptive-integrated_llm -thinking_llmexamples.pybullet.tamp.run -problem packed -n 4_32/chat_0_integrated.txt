User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.083, 0.315), (0.182, 0.414)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.027, 0.348, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.949, -0.316).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.191, -0.543), (0.279, -0.455)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.237, -0.099, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.599, 0.801).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.132, 0.365, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.926, 0.378).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.235, -0.499, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.154, 0.988).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.076, 0.299), (0.022, 0.397)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.193, -0.143), (0.28, -0.056)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning: Unachievable Goal Due to Action Restrictions**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of my thought process. The objective is to rearrange four objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) onto surface v18. I'm faced with this situation:
           
           1.  **Initial Assessment**: I have two robot arms (v4 and v6) with empty hands. The initial state shows these objects are currently supported on v11. I need to move each object individually to v18.
           2.  **Action Analysis**: The core of this problem hinges on `pick` and `place` actions. However, the initial state *only* provides an instance of the `move_base` action, and crucially, *no* instances of `pick` or `place`. Furthermore, there are no available kinesthetic information (kin, traj) needed for pick and place operations, making them impossible.
           3.  **Constraints**: I'm extremely limited here. I have to work with *only* the single `move_base` instance, which, by definition, doesn't interact with objects in any way. The problem statement explicitly states that any actions *not* in the provided list are *not allowed*. This is the critical constraint. I can't derive or adapt the actions; I must use what's given. The template pose names (#o2) are not useful, given the action restrictions.
           4.  **Implication**:  I've concluded that without `pick` and `place` instances, I am fundamentally unable to manipulate the objects. I can't change their positions or support relationships. Therefore, I can't satisfy the desired `on` predicates that require changes in where the objects are supported.
           5.  **Conclusion**: The problem is unsolvable. The given initial state, goal, and the strictly limited actions allowed make it impossible to achieve the goal. No valid plan can be generated.
