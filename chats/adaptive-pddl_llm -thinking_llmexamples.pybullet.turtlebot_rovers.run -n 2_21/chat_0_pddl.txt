           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a pretty specific conjunction of facts. Analyzing the necessary conditions, I see I need to establish `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. To get `receivedimage`, I'd normally use `send_image`. For `receivedanalysis`, it would be `send_analysis`. Simple enough, right?
           
           The issue? I'm severely constrained. I've only been given permission to use four actions: `move` and `drop_rock`. None of these, in any combination, will allow me to establish `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`. Those predicates rely on image capture and analysis which need specific actions that aren't available to me.
           
           I tried to craft a solution, attempting a detailed breakdown of the steps, but it's fundamentally impossible. No matter how clever I get, I can't conjure up images or analyses with just `move` and `drop_rock`. Therefore, I must conclude that the task, under these given constraints, is unachievable. The problem is a mismatch between the desired outcomes and the permitted actions. The actions needed to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` goal are not included in the allowed action set.
