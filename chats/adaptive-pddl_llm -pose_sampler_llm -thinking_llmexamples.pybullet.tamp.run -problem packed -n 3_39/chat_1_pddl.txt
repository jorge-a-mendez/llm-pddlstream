           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Plan is Blocked: The Goal is Unreachable**
           
           Okay, so the objective is clear: I need to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all *on* `v16`.  Based on the `on` axiom, that means they need to be at a specific *pose* and *supported* by `v16`. Currently, they're supported by `v11` at poses `v9`, `v13`, and `v15` respectively.  I see that placing them at `pose #o2` would satisfy the "supported" requirement based on the facts provided, as they'd then also be supported by `v10`. However, my main focus is `v16`.
           
           The initial plan is to manipulate the objects using `pick` and `place` actions with the robot arm, `v4`. The `kin` facts give me the information for the poses, base configurations (`bconf`), grasps, and arm trajectories. Unfortunately, all the necessary `kin` facts are for base configuration `#o3`.
           
           Here's the problem: the only allowed `move_base` action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This keeps the robot's base configuration at `v3`, which is *not* `#o3`.  To execute a `pick` or `place` action, I *must* be at `#o3` (as shown by my analysis of the `pick` and `place` preconditions).  But I can't get there.
           
           The single available action instance simply keeps the robot at `v3`, and there's no way to reach `#o3`.  Without being able to execute `pick` and `place`, I can't move the objects to `pose #o2`, and therefore, I can't achieve the goal of having them all `on v16`.
           
           Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that the goal is currently unreachable with the given state and available actions.  I need a way to move the robot base to the necessary configuration, and currently, I have no way to do that.
