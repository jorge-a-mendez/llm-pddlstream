           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.07, -0.381), (0.008, -0.303)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.029, 0.437), (0.127, 0.535)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.038, -0.544, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.998, -0.059).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.031, -0.342, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.75, 0.661).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.078, 0.486, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.32, 0.948).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.0, -0.583), (0.077, -0.505)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning to Move Objects**
           
           My task is to formulate a plan to move three objects (v8, v12, and v14) from their current locations to a target surface (v16). The initial state describes the objects' positions and support relationships, and the goal is to place each object on v16. Since I know my field well, I recognize that this calls for a series of pick-and-place actions, repeated for each object.
           
           I will need to carefully consider the preconditions for each action. The pick action needs the arm to be empty and correctly configured, and the object needs to be at the target pose. Similarly, the place action requires the object to be held by the arm and the base in the right configuration.
           
           Crucially, I also need to ensure the robot's base is in the correct configuration (#o3) for the pick and place actions, and I also need a place that doesn't cause a collision for each object. The key insight is that since I'm placing objects on a surface, I can consider the AABB of each object to figure this out. I have defined a plan as follows:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  First, I will move the robot's base to the configuration `#o3` if it is not already there.
           2.  **Pick:** For each object (v8, v12, and v14), I will first pick it up from its current location using the arm and appropriate grasp.
           3.  **Place:** Then, I will place the object on the surface v16 at a specific collision-free location. This specific pose for `#o2` will be different for each object.
           4.  **Repeat:** Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the remaining objects.
           
           I am given that v16 has the AABB ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           I have to place objects, considering all possible collisions. I will then place `v14` centered at `(-0.08, 0, 0.781, 0)`. Then I will place `v8` at center `(-0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0)`. Then, I will place `v12` at center `(0.08, 0, 0.781, 0)`
           
           The resulting plan will consist of a base movement followed by a series of pick and place actions for each object, ensuring all objects are correctly placed and the robot's preconditions are all met.
