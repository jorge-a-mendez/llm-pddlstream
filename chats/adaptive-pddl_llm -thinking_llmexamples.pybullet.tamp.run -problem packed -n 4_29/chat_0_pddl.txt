           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `on(v8, v18)`, `on(v12, v18)`, `on(v14, v18)`, and `on(v16, v18)`.  This, fundamentally, means I need to make sure all these objects are supported by `v18` at their designated poses.
           
           Looking at the initial state, each object (v8, v12, v14, v16) is currently supported by `v11`, and their current poses reflect that. Crucially, they *also* have a possible pose, `#o2`, where they could be supported by `v18`. All objects have the property `stackable` and the ability to be grasped.
           
           The robot has two arms, both empty, and its base configuration allows movement. However, the *only* action I'm given is `move_base`. No `pick` or `place` instances are available.
           
           Now, to get an object *on* `v18`, I need to use a `place` action. That's the only way to change the `atpose` of an object from what it is now, on `v11`, to a configuration supported by `v18`.  `Clean` and `Cook` have no relevance here.
           
           The logical procedure would be to pick up each object, and then place it on `v18`. But wait! I can't.
           
           Since I am restricted to the provided action instances, and I don't see any `pick` or `place` instances in that list, I can't pick up or place anything. I'm stuck moving the robot base in place.
           
           Consequently, since the current *atpose* cannot be modified,  I cannot meet my goal.  I am blocked by the lack of `pick` and `place` instances. There is no plan to achieve the goal under the given action constraints.
