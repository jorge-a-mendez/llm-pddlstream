           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 5) -- 0.07000000000000028, 0.06999999999999995)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5, which is a square (0.07 x 0.07), on surface 0, defined by the points (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0).  I'll ensure "stable" means the object stays entirely within the surface boundaries, considering rotations. Since the object's dimensions are almost equal, rotating won't drastically change its effective size.
           
           I'm calculating the maximum possible effective dimension for any rotation which, for a square, is its diagonal, or side * sqrt(2). Then, I'm setting a grid of (x,y) coordinates within a safe zone. This zone is determined by the surface boundaries, adjusted inward to accommodate the diagonal length *half*. These grid points guarantee that *any* rotation of the object will be fully contained within the surface. I'll pick a 5x5 grid.
           
           To add diversity, I will use two rotations: 0 and pi/4 radians. A rotation of pi/4 effectively sets the dimensions of a square equal to the diagonal length. This gives me 25 points, each paired with two different rotation angles for 50 total placements.
