           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning for Achieving the Goal: `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, so the ultimate goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which breaks down into `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.  I can see that `type(v12, v17)` is already true in the initial state, meaning I just need to get `on(v12, v18)` to be true, and `v12` works out as a valid value for `?green`. I can make `on(v12, v18)` true by ensuring `atpose(v12, #o2)` is true.
           
           Looking at the initial state, I see `atpose(v12, v13)` is true, and I have `stackable(v12, v18)`, which means I can place `v12` on `v18`. I also see that `pose(v12, #o2)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` are true, which confirms that `#o2` is a valid pose to achieve the `on` predicate. I want to move `v12` from its current pose `v13` to the target pose `#o2` supported by `v18`.
           
           My plan is to use the existing `pick` and `place` actions.  I'll start with picking `v12` from `v13` using the available arm `v4` and a suitable grasp `#o1`.  The preconditions for the `pick` action are all satisfied in the initial state, including `handempty(v4)`. I'll follow this up by placing `v12` at `#o2` with the same arm and grasp.  Again, the preconditions for `place` look good, especially since `atgrasp(v4, v12, #o1)` will be true after the `pick` action, which is a required precondition. I need the trajectories too, but I can see that `kin` predicates define them implicitly. Since I have a valid pick and place action, I can assume trajectories are also valid.
           
           I'm making a key assumption here that `atbconf(#o3)` is true. The kin predicates and the existence of the `move_base` action strongly suggest that the robot is currently at base configuration `#o3`.
           
           Once I've executed `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)` and `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`, I'll have achieved `atpose(v12, #o2)`, which combined with the initial facts that will establish `on(v12, v18)`. Since `type(v12, v17)` is already true, this plan will then satisfy the goal of `new-axiom@0()`.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', #o3) is not satisfied!`. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Plan's Failure: The Crucial Missing Piece - `atbconf(#o3)`**
           
           Okay, so the previous attempt failed because the `pick` action's precondition, `atbconf(#o3)`, wasn't satisfied. Time to dissect this situation.
           
           First, I need to meticulously re-examine the initial state and the provided actions. Looking closely at the initial state, I can see that while `bconf(#o3)` is present, crucially, `atbconf(#o3)` is *not*.  This is the key. The initial state establishes that `#o3` *is* a base configuration, but it *doesn't* tell us the robot is *currently at* that configuration. This is a subtle but critical distinction.
           
           Digging further, I then examined all available actions. The only `move_base` action instance provided, `(move_base #o3 #o3 #o0)`, requires `atbconf(#o3)` as its precondition. This becomes a major problem. If `atbconf(#o3)` is false initially, the robot can't even *start* with a base movement.  And, as I now understand, if `atbconf(#o3)` isn't true initially, the problem solver will not consider *any* base configuration, this is a real issue.
           
           By carefully considering the problem description, I'm reminded that any fact not explicitly stated in the initial state is *false*.  Since `atbconf(#o3)` is absent from the initial state, it's definitively false.
           
           Therefore, the `pick` action cannot be executed, as its precondition `atbconf(?q)` (which, in this case, would be `atbconf(#o3)`) is false. Consequently, the provided `move_base` action cannot be executed either, because it also requires `atbconf(#o3)`. I'm starting to see a pattern here.
           
           This lack of `atbconf(#o3)` is a fatal flaw. Any attempt at `pick` or `place` would fail because those also require `atbconf(#o3)`. Similarly, any base motion action will fail for the same reason. The robot is effectively paralyzed.
           
           Let's look more closely at the goal, `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having the green object, in this instance `v12`, on the object represented by `v18`.  Given `type(v12, v17)` and the requirements of the problem, I *must* move `v12` to `#o2` so that it supports `v18`. In the initial state, `v12` is at `atpose(v12, v13)` and `supported(v12, v13, v14)`. The goal state requires `on(v12, v18)`, which implies `atpose(v12, #o2)`. To do this, I need to execute the `pick` and `place` actions in sequence.
           
           As I pointed out, both `pick` and `place` require `atbconf(#o3)`. Moreover, the only `move_base` instance, `(move_base #o3 #o3 #o0)`, also requires `atbconf(#o3)`. This is a deadlock. I can't satisfy `atbconf(#o3)` because there is no way to achieve it given the available actions and the initial state. The robot is stuck.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable. The crucial missing ingredient is the initial condition `atbconf(#o3)`, which is needed to execute any relevant action.
