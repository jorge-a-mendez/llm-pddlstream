           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` is an axiom that becomes true when `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true.
           From the initial state, we know `type(v8, v17)`, `type(v12, v17)`. So, ?green can be `v8` or `v12`.
           If ?green is `v8`, then we need `on(v8, v18)`. This means `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)`.
           From the initial state, `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`. So, `v8` is on `v11`, not `v18`.
           We also have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `pose(v8, #o2)`. If we could place `v8` at `#o2`, the goal would be satisfied for `v8`. However, there are no pick/place actions available in the provided action instances.
           
           If ?green is `v12`, then we need `on(v12, v18)`. This means `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)`.
           From the initial state, `atpose(v12, v13)` and `supported(v12, v13, v14)`. So, `v12` is on `v14`, not `v18`.
           We also have `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` and `pose(v12, #o2)`. If we could place `v12` at `#o2`, the goal would be satisfied for `v12`. Again, no pick/place actions are available.
           
           The only available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which moves the robot's base from `v3` to `v3`. This action does not change the `on` predicate. Since there are no actions to pick up and place objects on `v18`, the goal is not achievable with the given action instances.
           
           The goal is not achievable because there are no pick/place actions available to change the `on` predicate of `v8` or `v12` to `v18`.
