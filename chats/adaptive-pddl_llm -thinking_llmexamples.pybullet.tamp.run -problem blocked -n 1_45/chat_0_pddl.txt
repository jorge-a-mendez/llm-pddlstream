           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of Goal Reachability**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with devising a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, but the catch is, I'm only allowed to use a very specific action instance. Let's break this down.  The goal, in essence, boils down to having an object of a certain type be *on* another specific object, `v18`.  Initially, I analyzed the initial state, looking for any immediate matches. It's quickly apparent that I'm dealing with objects `v8` and `v12` which are of the type I need, `v17`.  The problem is, neither is *on* `v18` initially.
           
           My initial thought was to use *pick* and *place* actions to reposition one of these objects.  However, the instructions very clearly state that only the action instances provided are allowed.  And the *only* one I'm given is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This action is a motion within the environment.
           
           I then did some checking of what predicates are affected by this allowed action. All this single action does is change the `atbconf` and `canmove` predicates. This has no effect on any objects existing `on` predicates, or `type` predicates. This allowed action is unable to bring about a change that would make this goal reachable.
           
           Realizing this, I went back and meticulously re-read the problem statement, specifically the rule about the *allowed* action instances. The lack of `pick` and `place` instances is the *key* constraint here.  I'm basically hamstrung.
           
           Since the goal requires changing the spatial relationships of objects (specifically, putting something *on* `v18`), and the *only* available action doesn't facilitate that change, the goal is, unfortunately, *unreachable* with the given constraints. I must conclude the goal cannot be achieved with the given action instance.
