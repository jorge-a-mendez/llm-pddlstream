           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **A Deep Dive into Reaching the Goal**
           
           Okay, I've got a clear picture of what we need to do. Our goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which basically boils down to making sure a certain object (let's call it `?green`) is *on* `v18` and is of a particular *type* (`v17`). Fortunately, the type is already established for either `v12` or `v8`. The challenge is to get one of them *on* `v18`.
           
           My thinking is this:  To have an object *on* something else, it needs to be *supported* by it *and* be at a specific *pose*.  From the initial state, I've noticed key facts: `atpose(v12, v13)`, `supported(v12, v13, v14)`, etc.  I also see that `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` is possible, and there's a corresponding `pose(v12, #o2)`. This screams "move `v12` to `#o2` on `v18`".
           
           To do that, I'll need to use the `pick` and `place` actions.  The trick here is figuring out the *kinematic* relationships. I see that there are several `kin` facts related to `v12` such as `kin(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)`.  The base configuration in these facts is `#o3`. Now, I'm assuming that the continuous parameters like #o3 could resolve to something existing to be able to make any plans here. Also, since there is only a `move_base v3 v3 #o0` available, and the current base is `atbconf(v3)`, so let's assume `#o3` is `v3` for these kin facts. This is crucial; otherwise, I cannot use `pick` and `place`.
           
           So, the plan unfolds:
           1.  **`pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, v3, #o4)`:**  Assuming `#o3` = `v3`, this action should work because all the preconditions seem to be met (`kin`, `atpose`, `handempty`, and base configurations).  It picks `v12` up.
           2.  **`place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`:**  Again, based on the `kin` facts, *and*  assuming `#o3` = `v3`, the pre conditions of this step looks valid.  So, this places `v12` at `#o2`.
           
           Once that's done, voila!  We'll have `atpose(v12, #o2)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` making `on(v12, v18)` true. Combine that with the already true `type(v12, v17)`, and we've successfully satisfied `new-axiom@0()`!
           
           The key is that the assumption that the continuous parameter `#o3` *must* resolve to the existing base configuration `v3`.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Unreachable Goal Due to Action Constraints**
           
           Okay, I've re-examined the problem. The user was right; my previous plan included invalid actions. I was given a very specific constraint: I *must* only use the valid action instance `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This is my only tool.
           
           The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having something green *on* a specific region, specifically `on(?green, v18)`. This means making either `on(v12, v18)` or `on(v8, v18)` true, since both `v12` and `v8` are green objects.
           
           Now, for something to be "on" something else, it needs to be *supported* in that region *and* be at the correct pose.  Both `v12` and `v8` are *supported* in region `v18` at pose `#o2`. My current state, however, shows that `v12` is at pose `v13` and `v8` is at pose `v9`. Therefore, I need to make `atpose(v12, #o2)` or `atpose(v8, #o2)` true.  This would require picking up and placing one of the objects.
           
           The problem is, the only action I'm allowed to use is `move_base`. This action simply moves the base from `v3` to `v3` using trajectory `#o0`.  Its preconditions are all satisfied, and it leaves `atbconf` true (meaning I don't move), and `canmove` false.
           
           `move_base` does *nothing* to alter the *atpose* status of any object. It doesn't move objects, doesn't pick them up, or place them. The `pick`, `place`, `cook`, or `clean` actions needed to achieve the goal are simply *not* available to me. I can move the base all I want, but I can't actually change the location of the objects themselves.
           
           Given the goal and the limited actions, the `on(?o, ?r)` predicate cannot be made true. It is, therefore, impossible to reach the goal `new-axiom@0()` with the given action constraints.
