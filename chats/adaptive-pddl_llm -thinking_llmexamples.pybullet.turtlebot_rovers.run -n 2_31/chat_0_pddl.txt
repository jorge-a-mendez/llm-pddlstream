           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unachievable Goal: New-Axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom boils down to verifying a conjunction of several atoms, mainly concerning image and analysis reception. I've started by examining each predicate in the axiom, checking its initial state. The initial state satisfies most of the conditions, like `atconf` and `free`. However, the core challenges lie in achieving `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` for specific objects like stones and soil.
           
           The goal hinges on the following unfulfilled predicates: `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, and `receivedanalysis` for at least one stone and one soil sample.
           
           Now, analyzing the available actions: I'm restricted to `move` and `drop_rock` actions. The `move` actions are practically no-ops, preserving the initial `atconf` configuration. The `drop_rock` actions are conditional: they require the rovers to be *full* which is currently not the case as they are *free*.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`, I'd need a sequence of actions including `send_image`, which, in turn, depends on `take_image`, which requires `calibrated` and `haveimage`. Similarly, for `receivedanalysis`, I need to use `send_analysis` that requires `analyzed`. All of these crucial actions are out of reach. There are no actions available to achieve the prerequisites like `haveimage` or `analyzed`.
           
           After careful consideration of the initial state, the goal definition, and the restrictive actions permitted, it's clear: the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently *unachievable* within the constraints of this problem. I have no means to manipulate the state to satisfy all the required predicates, such as receiving images or receiving analysis.
