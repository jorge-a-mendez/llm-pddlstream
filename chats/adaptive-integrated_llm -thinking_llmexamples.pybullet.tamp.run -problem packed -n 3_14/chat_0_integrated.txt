User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.144, -0.447), (-0.048, -0.351)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.237, 0.199), (-0.165, 0.271)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.201, 0.235, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, -0.018).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.221, -0.491, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.624, 0.782).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.263, -0.533), (-0.179, -0.449)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.096, -0.399, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.865, 0.501).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom pose(v12, v13)

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan to Stack Objects on v16**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get objects *v8*, *v12*, and *v14* all stacked on *v16*.  They're currently all on *v11*, which seems to be a table or surface. I need to figure out where to put them on *v16*, which is also a surface but is of a similar size to these objects. Looks like I need to pick them up from the current table and put them on top of the other table. I am constrained by only using the provided actions, which are basically pick and place, with continuous parameters that I must solve for.
           
           The key to this plan lies in how to arrange the objects on *v16*. I need to determine poses for the objects so that they fit. *v16* has some spatial boundaries I must adhere to, so I'll calculate positions. I'm going to put them next to each other along the x-axis, using a specific formula to compute coordinates. To make sure they're stable, I must ensure they're fully contained. It's safe to assume the height is also the same as they were before.
           
           My plan then boils down to a sequence of pick-and-place operations:
           
           1.  **Pick:** *v8* from its initial location.
           2.  **Place:** *v8* onto *v16* at a calculated position.
           3.  **Pick:** *v12* from its initial location.
           4.  **Place:** *v12* onto *v16* at a calculated position.
           5.  **Pick:** *v14* from its initial location.
           6.  **Place:** *v14* onto *v16* at a calculated position.
           
           These action steps will require continuous values for arm trajectories, grasp configurations, and poses to be computed for each move, which I will leave for the planner. Now to generate these continuous parameters based on my calculations.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v8) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #t_place_v8) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v12) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #t_place_v12) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v14) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #t_place_v14)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Plan's Impossibility**
           
           Okay, so the user's absolutely right to point this out. I've been over this problem a thousand times, and sometimes I miss the most obvious constraint. The previous plan *clearly* tries to use `pick` and `place` actions, and the only permitted action instance is `move_base`. That's a huge problem.
           
           Essentially, we're stuck. With only `move_base`, and no way to *manipulate* the objects in the world, the plan is dead in the water. We need to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`.  Currently, they're *on* `v11`, but that's not where we want them.  We *could* technically move the base around, but that's not going to get the objects onto the target without a way to pick them up and put them down!
           
           Given the initial state and the axioms, we already know the objects are *on* `v11`. To achieve the `on` goal condition with `v16`, the objects would have to be supported at a pose that is also supported by `v16`. But, if we can't interact with the objects at all, there's absolutely no way to alter that arrangement.
           
           The constraints are too severe. The problem is fundamentally unsolvable with the provided action instances. We're going to need to revise our strategy significantly. We've got a classic case of an unsolvable planning problem if we're limited to only moving the base.
