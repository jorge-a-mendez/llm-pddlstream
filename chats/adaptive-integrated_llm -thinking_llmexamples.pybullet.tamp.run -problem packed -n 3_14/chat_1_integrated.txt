           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.237, 0.199), (-0.165, 0.271)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.263, -0.533), (-0.179, -0.449)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.144, -0.447), (-0.048, -0.351)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.201, 0.235, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, -0.018).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.221, -0.491, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.624, 0.782).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.096, -0.399, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.865, 0.501).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement Plan for Multiple Objects on a Restricted Surface**
           
           My objective is to arrange three graspable objects (v8, v12, v14) onto the surface of a target object (v16). The key constraint is that the base of the robot arm (v4) cannot move, limiting all actions to the robot's current base position (v3).
           
           **Understanding the Environment:**
           
           *   **Objects:**
               *   v8, v12, v14: These are the graspable objects, each currently located on another object (v11).
               *   v16: This is the target surface.
               *   I've carefully examined the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for each object. This is a crucial step to determine a stable and collision-free placement on the target surface.
           *   **Actions:**
               *   `pick` and `place`: These are the fundamental actions, executed by the controllable arm (v4).
               *   `move_base`: This is not possible given the `move_base v3 v3` action instance.
           *   **Poses:**
               *   I recognize the importance of calculating valid placement poses within the confines of the target surface's AABB.
           *   **Grasps:**
               *   The `kin` predicates define the specific reachable poses, and the continuous parameters `#o1` grasp and `#o4` the trajectory are crucial but not required to be specified. I do need to specify `#o2` the pose for each object.
           *   **Constraints:**
               *   The robot base immobility means all actions must be executable from the current base configuration.
               *   The available `kin` predicates define valid configurations for the arm (v4).
           
           **Execution Plan:**
           
           My strategy is to perform a sequence of pick-and-place operations for each object. The key to success is careful consideration of:
           
           1.  **Collision Avoidance:**  I've thoroughly analyzed the objects' AABBs to determine safe and stable poses on the target surface (v16). To avoid collision, I calculated the permissible range for each object’s center such that each object has stable contact with v16. I've selected `x` poses for the objects where they can be placed in contact with each other, minimizing the surface space.  Then I set `y = 0` to make placement simpler.
           2.  **Sequence of Actions:**
               1.  Pick v8 from v9.
               2.  Place v8 at a calculated pose `#o2_v8`, where `(x=-0.09, y=0.0, z=0.781)`.
               3.  Pick v12 from v13.
               4.  Place v12 at a calculated pose `#o2_v12`, where `(x=0.069, y=0.0, z=0.781)`.
               5.  Pick v14 from v15.
               6.  Place v14 at a calculated pose `#o2_v14`, where `(x=-0.021, y=0.0, z=0.781)`.
           3.  **Key Assumption:**
               *   I have assumed that the z-coordinate for placing objects on v16 is `0.781`, based on the initial poses of the objects and the available data.
           
           **Reasoning:**
           
           The order of picking and placing the objects doesn't affect the goal's achievability. I can calculate the values for `#o2_v8`, `#o2_v12`, and `#o2_v14` to ensure no collisions. My approach requires precise grasp points. I have considered the geometry of the objects and the supporting surface in detail to find stable, collision-free placements. Since the base doesn't move, these poses must be reachable by the arm (v4) from the initial base position.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I messed up. I completely missed the crucial detail that I *only* have access to the `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` action. That's a huge problem. I was thinking about the `pick` and `place` actions, naturally, because that's what I'd use to manipulate the objects to satisfy the goal. But no, the constraints are clear: **I can't pick or place.**
           
           Let's break this down. The goal is to get v8, v12, and v14 all *on* v16. To do that, I'd need to first get them *atpose* on v16. However, the initial state shows they are all *on* v11, supported on v11, and *atpose* on their current positions.  
           
           With my understanding of the predicates, I know that to get an object *on* something, I need the object to be *supported* by that thing and *atpose* on that thing.  I'm stuck because I *must* change the `atpose` of v8, v12, and v14.
           
           The `move_base` action... well, it does *nothing* that's relevant to this. It just changes the robot's configuration to the same configuration, essentially a no-op action. It does not affect any of the object's `atpose` or `on` predicates.
           
           Therefore, since I cannot pick and place these objects, I cannot change their positions. Consequently, the goal is *impossible* to achieve with the given action constraint. It's a fundamental constraint violation.  I have to state that the goal cannot be reached.
