User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Strategic Robot Base Placement for Target Acquisition**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with figuring out three good spots for a robot base to get a clear shot at a specific target point. Here's the deal: each base has to be within 2 units of the target, and we're sticking to the grid, x and y both between -2.5 and 2.5. The robot's orientation will handle itself, lining up with the target, but I've got to make sure there's no collision with any obstacles, and, crucially, that there's a clear line of sight.
           
           First, I laid out the whole scene visually. The room is a square from -2.5 to 2.5 on both axes. No problem there. Then I listed all the fixed obstacles: the room's walls (which act as boundaries), a central pillar splitting the space, and a bunch of boxes of different sizes cluttering the area. The key obstacle is the central pillar (x=0) because the target lies on the *left* side of it.
           
           With the obstacles mapped, I had to be smart about picking candidate positions. The core challenge is avoiding line-of-sight obstruction, especially from that central pillar (x=0). Basically, I need to stay on the left side, where the pillar won't get in the way. Given the target's location (-1.0, 0.49), I had to make sure the robot's x-coordinate stayed safely away from it.
           
           Now, my strategy came down to generating candidate spots around the target. I'll need to generate points within a radius of 2 from the target and check if any objects block the path from that point to the target. I could do this computationally, but since I have the map in front of me, let's eyeball a few positions that *should* work.
           
           So, I start with a simple calculation: Let the target be at (`tx`, `ty`), I need to place the robot at (`px`, `py`). I need to make sure that the square root of ((`px`-`tx`)^2 + (`py`-`ty`)^2) is less than or equal to 2, and that the robot sits inside the playable grid. That is, -2.5 <= `px` <= 2.5 and -2.5 <= `py` <= 2.5. I know that from the input, the target is at `(-0.9995543788506163, 0.4912953255909249)`.
           
           With the target at (-1.0, 0.49), I see that the obstacle 14 (box) is at about x=-0.95 and y=-0.6, just below the target. So, I will avoid anything that's directly below to avoid collisions or obstruction.
           
           First, I picked three spots, and worked through the details. 
           
           *   **Position 1:** I picked a spot right above the target at a distance of 1.5. I got the coordinates (-0.99955, 1.9913) where `px=-0.99955` and `py= 1.9913`.
           *   **Position 2:** Next, I moved left and up with a distance of 0.5. At this point, the calculations for `px` and `py` generated coordinates of (-1.35310, 0.84485).
           *   **Position 3:** Finally, I picked a third, far left and below with a distance of 2.0. The coordinates turned out to be at (-2.41375, -0.9229).
           
           I'm confident these three spots are a great set, meeting all constraints and offering varied positions for the robot to move around. The x coordinates are well within the playable grid and far enough from the central pillar and other nearby objects.
