           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal: Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           The goal, as I see it, is to ensure that an object, which I'll dub `green_object`, fulfills two conditions: it must be "on" something (specifically, `v18`) and it must be of a specific "type" (`v17`). Delving into the initial state, I can see that `v8` and `v12` both fit the bill for the right "type," making them potential candidates.
           
           My initial thought is to try to stack `v8` on `v18` by first manipulating `v8`. To ensure `v8` is on `v18`, I need to position `v8` such that it's supported by `v18`. Since `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is already true, I just need to get `v8` to that `#o2` pose.
           
           The initial state suggests a basic pick-and-place strategy: pick up `v8` from its current pose (`v9`) using an available arm and then place it at the desired `#o2` pose. The robot has several available poses, so I'll utilize `#o3` for the base configuration and `#o4` for trajectories.
           
           Before picking, I must address the robot's base configuration. The current base configuration is `v3` but my plan requires configuration `#o3` and moving between configurations. Thus, moving the base to `#o3` is necessary. To do this, `canmove()` must be true and `atbconf(v3)` needs to be true, and `atbconf(#o3)` needs to be true. Now, I have an action to achieve this (move_base).
           
           Now the robot should be in the correct configuration. Next, I need to pick up `v8` from its initial pose (`v9`). This requires that the arm `v4` be hand-empty and that `v8` be at that pose. The pick-and-place actions will be of the form `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)` and `(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`.
           
           Finally, place `v8` at the goal location, which would require the same movement as picking and putting `v8` onto pose `#o2` and ensuring `handempty(v4)`. From there, I need to make sure `atpose(v8, #o2)` is true. If that's done, I now have the desired situation: `v8` is on `v18`.
           
           So, the plan would consist of these steps:
           
           1.  Move the base from `v3` to `#o3`.
           2.  Pick `v8` with arm `v4` from its initial position `v9`.
           3.  Place `v8` on `v18` at pose `#o2`.
           
           This sequence should satisfy all the goal conditions, which should make `new-axiom@0()` true! I can confidently say that this approach appears solid.
