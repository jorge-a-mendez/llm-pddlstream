           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           My objective is to devise a plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to ensuring an object of type `v17` is `on` `v18`. Given the available initial state, this means either `v8` or `v12` must be positioned `on` `v18`.
           
           To achieve `on(?o, v18)`, I need to satisfy `supported(?o, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`.  I've identified that both `v8` and `v12` are initially supported by `v18` at pose `#o2`.
           
           However, the current poses are `atpose(v8, v9)` and `atpose(v12, v13)`.  Therefore, I need to manipulate these objects to reach the desired pose `#o2`.  This requires the actions `pick` and `place`.
           
           The problem specifies, however, that the only allowed action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This action has no effect on `atpose` or `supported` facts, and is essentially a no-op.
           
           The core issue lies in the constraint that only the specified `move_base` action is permitted. Since `pick` and `place` are necessary to change the `atpose` and achieve the `on` predicate, and these actions are explicitly prohibited, the goal is **unachievable** with the given constraints.
