(Thoughts: **Planning to Satisfy new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is `new-axiom@0()`. Examining the axioms, it's clear that to achieve this, I need to ensure that an object is "on" another object and that its type is also something.  I need an object that's "on" `v18`, which I'm assuming is a receptacle.  The "type" component is straightforward, needing a green object or a green-like object; in this initial state, this is given.
           
           My first thought is I need to identify an object to satisfy the "on" condition. I have a few objects to choose from. I'm seeing that there is no *green* object, which will be the *object* that needs to be moved. The objects I can consider:  `v8`, `v12`, `v15` look like graspable objects. I can select either `v8` or `v12` as a viable *?green* object for the condition to be true. Let's make `?green` be `v12`
           
           I now need to set the goal for this to be `on(v12, v18)`.
           I know that "on" means supported by and has to be at a certain pose. I'll need to locate `v12` and see where it *is* in relation to where it *needs to be*. The initial state shows `v12` is at pose `#p0` and is *supported* by v18. I need to move `v12` to `#p0`.
           
           `v12` is *currently* at a pose which is `v13`. It has a grasp, a current trajectory, a place that it rests, and a current pose. `v4` is controllable and seems to be in a *handempty* state, and can be used to achieve this objective. The steps required should be to: *Pick* `v12` from where it is (`v13`) and then *place* it in the intended pose (`#p0`).
           
           I have the necessary actions.
           I have the pick action:  `(pick v4 v12 v13 #g0 #q0 #t0)`.  This requires moving the base *first*. The base needs to move from `v3` to `#q0` where I can grasp `v12`. I need to execute `(move_base v3 #q0 #t1)` *before* picking.
           
           With the base now correctly configured at `#q0` I can then pick up `v12`. The preconditions are satisfied.  Then place it where it needs to be with `place v4 v12 #p0 #g0 #q1 #t2`. I'll need to move the base again, this time to `#q1`, which will satisfy the requirements for this move.
           
           The base will move. The actions are:
           1.  `(move_base v3 #q0 #t1)`: Move base to grasp.
           2.  `(pick v4 v12 v13 #g0 #q0 #t0)`: Then pick it up.
           3.  `(move_base #q0 #q1 #o0)`: Move the base to place.
           4.  `(place v4 v12 #p0 #g0 #q1 #t2)`: And place it.
           
           The plan appears valid, given all the assumed and available facts. The initial state is the correct set of known true predicates, and the post-state predicates are also checked. It is valid.
           I believe this plan will succeed in satisfying the goal. The robot hand is empty. The base is not in an *atbconf* which needs to be adjusted. After placing v12, it is in pose #p0, and the goal `on(v12, v18)` can be assumed.  Since I know that `type(v12, v17)`, the target,  `new-axiom@0()` is satisfied.
