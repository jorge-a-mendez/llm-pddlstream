           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unachievable Goal: new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, so the objective is to make the axiom `new-axiom@0()` true. This requires both `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` to be satisfied. I've identified that either `v8` or `v12` could potentially be the 'green' object because they both have the correct `type` in the initial state.
           
           The key to `on(?green, v18)` is that `?green` must be at pose `#o2` and supported by `v18`. From the initial state, I know that both `v8` and `v12` *are* supported by `#o2`, but their current poses are `v9` and `v13` respectively.  I'd need to manipulate their poses to be `#o2` for either object to satisfy `on(?, v18)`.
           
           My usual approach would be to `pick` and `place` either object, but only one action is allowed in this plan: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action doesn't actually *move* the base (it's essentially a no-op), and crucially, it doesn't modify any `atpose` facts.  Thus, it cannot change `v8` or `v12` to be at pose `#o2`.
           
           More critically, neither `pick` nor `place` is available, and even if they were, I lack essential *kin* facts in the initial state, which are preconditions for these actions.  So, even if I could pick them, I can't.
           
           Since I can't move the objects and I can't use the necessary `pick` and `place` actions because of the missing *kin* facts and the limited action list,  the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable with the permitted actions. Therefore, there's no plan I can create.
