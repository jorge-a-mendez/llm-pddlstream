           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, both equipped with a camera `v10` that supports mode `v11`. There are various rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`) of two types (`v2` and `v6`) and three objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`). A lander `v9` is available for communication. Each rover has a store `v16` which is currently free.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be achieved if several conditions are met:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are true. These are true in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true. These are true in the initial state.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, and `receivedimage(v19, v11)` are true. This means the rovers need to take images of objectives `v17`, `v18`, `v19` in mode `v11` and send them to the lander.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` are true. This means a rock of type `v2` needs to be analyzed. Rocks `v1`, `v3`, and `v4` are of type `v2`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` are true. This means a rock of type `v6` needs to be analyzed. Rocks `v5`, `v7`, and `v8` are of type `v6`.
           
           The available actions are limited to `move`, `drop_rock`. This means `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis` are *not* available actions directly.
           
           However, the `new-axiom@0()` also specifies that if `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates are true, then the goal is met. Given the provided list of allowed actions, it's clear that we can't directly achieve the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` conditions because `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions are explicitly *not* in the allowed actions list.
           
           Let's re-examine the problem constraints. The problem statement says: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." The provided list only contains `move` and `drop_rock` actions. This means that actions like `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` are *not* permitted.
           
           This is a critical constraint. If we cannot take images, send images, sample rocks, or send analyses, we cannot achieve the goal of `receivedimage` for objectives `v17`, `v18`, `v19` and `receivedanalysis` for rocks of type `v2` and `v6`.
           
           Therefore, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable with the given allowed actions.
           
           The axiom `new-axiom@0()` explicitly requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates to be true. Since the actions to achieve these predicates (take_image, send_image, sample_rock, send_analysis) are not available in the provided list of allowed actions, the goal is unreachable.
