           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Breakdown for Achieving `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Alright, let's dissect this. My goal is clear: I need to satisfy the conditions laid out by `new-axiom@0()`. This translates to securing two images (`receivedimage`), analyzing both a stone and soil sample (`receivedanalysis`), while adhering to specific positional and resource constraints. I'm going to leverage my expert understanding of planning and these initial conditions to devise a workable plan.
           
           First, I examined the sub-goals. I need to get images of objectives `v17` and `v18`. Simultaneously, I must analyze both a stone and soil sample. These are all rocks of a particular type already in the initial state, and they are accessible.
           
           The core of my approach is understanding the relationship between the available actions and their preconditions. To get an image, I have to *calibrate* the camera, *take* the image, and then *send* it. To analyze a rock, I need to *sample* it and then *send* the analysis. The tricky part is the *configuration* (`?q`) parameters. The initial state dictates where the rovers are, but the actions require certain visibility and access at *different* configuration parameters. Given that I have no ability to move from the initial `atconf` state (`v13` or `v15`), and that these actions require those initial configs to be equivalent to the necessary configurations, I have to make a key assumption.
           
           I'm assuming that the continuous parameters are equivalent to the current initial configuration of the rovers for the actions to be viable. That is, that the continuous parameter for, e.g., the rover's position for analysis, is equal to the rover's starting position at `v13` or `v15`. Any other interpretation makes this problem unsolvable.
           
           Given this key interpretation, the plan unfolds as follows:
           
           1.  **Rover v12 takes the lead.** Rover v14 isn't required based on the information provided.
           2.  **Image Acquisition:** I start by calibrating, capturing, and transmitting images for both `v17` and `v18`, ensuring each action has its preconditions met, by leveraging the rover's known configuration `v13`.
           3.  **Analysis:** Using `v12`, I sample a stone (`v1`) and send the analysis.
           4.  **Resource Management:** If I need to analyze a second item, I drop the previous rock if full, before proceeding to sample and analyze the soil sample (`v8`).
           
           This sequence carefully addresses all conditions specified in the goal, adhering to the logical preconditions of each action and ensuring that rover `v12` is effectively utilized. By strategically combining these actions, while ensuring a viable interpretation of the problem statement, I can confidently assert that this plan will achieve `new-axiom@0()`.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v12 v13 #o4 v17 v10), (take_image v12 v13 #o4 v17 v10 v11), (send_image v12 v13 #o1 v9 v17 v11), (calibrate v12 v13 #o4 v18 v10), (take_image v12 v13 #o4 v18 v10 v11), (send_image v12 v13 #o1 v9 v18 v11), (sample_rock v12 v13 v1 v16), (send_analysis v12 v13 #o1 v9 v1), (sample_rock v12 v13 v8 v16), (send_analysis v12 v13 #o1 v9 v8)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The previous plan included several actions that were not in the provided list of valid action instances. It appears that the only allowed actions are `move` actions that result in no change of configuration and `drop_rock` actions.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the goal `Atom new-axiom@0()` and the available actions.
           The goal requires:
           1.  `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: These are true in the initial state. The `move` actions `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)` do not change these facts, so they remain true.
           2.  `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: These are true in the initial state. The `drop_rock` actions can be used if `full` is true, to make `free` true. Since they are initially free, these conditions hold.
           3.  `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: To achieve these, `take_image` and `send_image` actions are required. None of these actions are in the list of valid action instances.
           4.  `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: To achieve these, `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` actions are required. None of these actions are in the list of valid action instances.
           
           Given the restricted list of valid actions, it is impossible to achieve `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` conditions because the necessary `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions are not available. The only available actions are `move` (which effectively does nothing here as it moves to the current configuration) and `drop_rock` (which can only be used if the store is full, and in this initial state, both stores `v16` are free).
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable with the provided valid actions.
