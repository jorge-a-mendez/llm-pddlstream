           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unreachable**
           
           My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which requires an object of type `v17` to be `on v18`. I've broken this down: I need to get either `v12` or `v8` (both of type `v17`) onto `v18`. To do this, I need to use the `on` axiom: something is 'on' something else if it is supported by something, and at a particular pose.
           
           I see that `v12` is initially on `v14` and `v8` is on `v11`.  Both can be placed on `v18` but their current positions must change.  The plan involves 'pick' and 'place' actions.
           
           **Challenges with Base Configuration**
           
           I'm hitting a roadblock. Both `pick` and `place` have a precondition: `atbconf(#o3)`. My current base configuration is `v3` and while I can move from `v3` to itself, there's no way to reach `#o3`.  All the relevant kinematic constraints indicate I *need* base configuration `#o3` for picking up and placing.
           
           **Dissecting the PDDL**
           
           Reviewing the PDDL, `#o3` is a continuous parameter (part of a kinematic specification) and `v3` is an object. They are fundamentally different things. The robot is currently at `v3`, and there's no available action to reach `#o3`. This means I cannot execute the required pick and place actions.
           
           **Conclusion**
           
           Due to the lack of an available `move_base` action to change the base configuration from `v3` to `#o3`,  I can't manipulate objects. I can't get `v12` or `v8` onto `v18`. Therefore, the `new-axiom@0()` goal is unreachable.
