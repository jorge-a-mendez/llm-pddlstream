           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the breakdown of my thinking process to achieve the goal `Atom new-axiom@0()`:**
           
           My initial thought is to figure out what `new-axiom@0()` actually means.  It turns out it boils down to making an object of a certain type be "on" another object.  Looking at the initial state, I see that I have two objects, `v8` and `v12`, that are of the right type (`v17`).  So my goal is to make either `v8` or `v12` be on `v18`.
           
           Now I need to figure out *how* to make something be "on" something else.  I look at the initial state and see facts like `supported` and `atpose`, which together seem to imply the "on" relationship, based on the axiom definition of it. I see that currently, neither `v8` nor `v12` is on `v18`.
           
           My strategy then becomes: I need to use the `place` action to get either `v8` or `v12` supported by and in the appropriate pose relative to `v18`. From the initial conditions, it looks like `v12` and `v8` can be supported by the target object `v18`.
           
           I've decided to go after `v12`, since it's the first object I could consider, and figure out how to put it on `v18`. I know that I must place `v12` at a location (a pose).  To do this, I need to pick it up first.  I see that there's a robot, and the robot seems to need to move to place it.  My mind immediately goes to the preconditions of the `place` action: I need the robot to be holding `v12`, at the right pose, and the base to be at the right configuration.
           
           Therefore, the plan crystallizes: I must first pick up `v12`, then place it on `v18`. I will also have to first move the robot's base to allow for a suitable `pick` action to occur.
           
           To pick it up, I look at the `pick` action's preconditions. The robot has to be holding nothing (`handempty`), the object has to be in an appropriate configuration, and the base has to be in the right location.
           
           Now I start constructing the steps:
           1.  **Move the robot base:** I note the initial base position is `v3`, but the `pick` and `place` actions need the base to be at `#o3`. Thus, `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`.
           2.  **Pick up the object:** `v12` is at `v13`, and I want the robot to grasp it, so the action is `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)`.
           3.  **Place the object:** Finally, to get `v12` on `v18`, I use `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`.
           
           Before finalizing, I need to go through all the preconditions to check that they are met *at the relevant stage of the plan*.  I verify that all the necessary conditions for each action are met by the initial state or by the results of the preceding actions.  I also double-check that the `canmove()` predicate holds throughout the execution of the plan.
           
           Given that all preconditions are met in the proposed plan and that the actions achieve the goal condition, I am confident that the plan works.
