           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 10 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's my plan for placing object ID 10 (with its axis-aligned bounding box dimensions of approximately 0.092 x 0.092) on surface 0, ensuring 50 stable placements. Since the object is nearly square, rotation primarily affects its orientation, not its bounding box size significantly. The surface is defined by `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`, meaning it's a rectangle with dimensions approximately 0.6 x 0.6. The first criterion is that the object's fully contained within the surface, and it should not collide with fixed obstacles or previously placed objects (these considerations will be addressed via feedback).
           
           My strategy is as follows. I'll define an AABB encompassing the object and it's rotation. Let `theta` be the rotation angle. If `theta` is not 0 or pi/2, the AABB size is (rotated_obj_size_x, rotated_obj_size_y) which can be calculated as `w_rot = w * abs(cos(theta)) + h * abs(sin(theta))` and `h_rot = w * abs(sin(theta)) + h * abs(cos(theta))` where w and h are the original bounding box dimensions.  But because the object is nearly square, there is little difference between these size calculations, and I can be conservative. My conservative approach will be to use the formula from any angle to calculate an AABB size, just to cover all cases.
           
           I will generate a grid of positions within surface 0 and then vary the rotation angle. Specifically, I'll use a 7x7 grid of points for theta=0, creating 49 placements. Then, to round out the 50, I will pick the surface's center point and assign it a rotation of pi/4 (45 degrees). Since all placements' bounding boxes will be within the surface dimensions at that angle, it fulfills our criteria.
