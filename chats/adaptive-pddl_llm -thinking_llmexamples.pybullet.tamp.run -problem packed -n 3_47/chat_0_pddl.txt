           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object

           v9: object
           ```
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom stackable(v14, v10)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)

           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom supported(v14, v15, v11)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom stackable(v14, v16)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)
           Atom atpose(v14, v15)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Assessing the Feasibility of the Task**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: getting v8, v12, and v14 all *on* v16. Simple enough, in principle. I need to figure out a plan, a series of actions, that will lead to that final state. My initial analysis of the current state reveals that v8, v12, and v14 are *currently* supported by v11. That's a good starting point, but not the end goal.
           
           The only action I have at my disposal is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This seems... limiting. It looks like it's just moving the robot's base around. No picking, no placing, no interaction with the objects themselves. I need to confirm this hunch.
           
           Let's look at the available actions more closely. I should be seeing actions like `pick` and `place` if I'm going to actually manipulate these objects. Clean, cook, move_base.  These are my available actions. I confirm my initial hunch: I'm missing the critical actions for this task!
           
           To achieve the desired state, I'd need to pick up each object from v11 and place it onto v16. That requires `pick` and `place` actions, which are clearly not available. With only `move_base` I'm effectively stuck. I can't move these objects as requested.
           
           Therefore, given the available actions, this goal is, unfortunately, unachievable. The planning process has led me to a dead end. Time to report back with the bad news.
