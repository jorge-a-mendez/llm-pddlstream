User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point is (2.3, 0.4).
           The scene has a large central obstacle at (0,0) with x and y dimensions spanning -2.5 to 2.5. However, there are also many smaller obstacles. Some of these are near the edges of the central obstacle, forming a sort of border. Others are scattered within the central obstacle.
           
           Given the target point (2.3, 0.4), I need to find positions within a circle of radius 2 centered at (2.3, 0.4). This means x will be in the range [0.3, 4.3] and y in the range [-1.6, 2.4]. However, the overall robot placement limits are x: [-2.5, 2.5] and y: [-2.5, 2.5]. This means the actual valid range for x is [0.3, 2.5] and for y is [-1.6, 2.4].
           
           I will try to place the robot in different quadrants relative to the target point to maximize diversity, while respecting the boundaries and avoiding the known obstacles.
           
           Obstacle 3: ((2.45, -2.55), (2.55, 2.55)) is a thin wall on the right boundary. This means I should not place the robot too close to x=2.5.
           Obstacle 13: ((2.09, -0.42), (2.22, -0.28)) is an obstacle very close to the target point. This means I should avoid positions like (2.1, -0.3)
           Obstacle 7: ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) is an obstacle in the upper right. This means I should avoid positions like (2, 2).
           
           I will try positions that are further away from the obstacles and closer to the edges of the allowed region.
           
           Positions:
           (1.8 0.4)
           (2 1.5)
           (1 0.4)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: (0.4677518308162689, 2.1503007411956787, 0.20100000500679016), Proposed position: (1.8, 0.4) -- no line of sight to target
           ```
           
           The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point is (0.4677518308162689, 2.1503007411956787). I will call this (0.47, 2.15) for simplicity.
           The robot can be placed within a distance of 2 from the target point. This means x can range from (0.47 - 2) = -1.53 to (0.47 + 2) = 2.47, and y can range from (2.15 - 2) = 0.15 to (2.15 + 2) = 4.15. Considering the overall robot placement limits, x is in [-1.53, 2.47] and y is in [0.15, 2.5].
           
           From the previous attempt, (1.8, 0.4) failed to have line of sight to the target (2.3, 0.4). This indicates there is an obstacle between these two points.
           
           The known obstacles in the vicinity of the target (0.47, 2.15) and within the allowed region for the robot base:
           Obstacle 1: ((-2.55, 2.45), (2.55, 2.55)) - A thin wall on the top boundary. This means I should avoid positions very close to y=2.5.
           Obstacle 19: ((0.43, 2.11), (0.50, 2.18)) - This is very close to the target point. This is a small obstacle right at the target, meaning I should avoid placing the robot where this object would occlude the target.
           Obstacle 9: ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)) - This is an obstacle around (0.5, 2). The target is inside this obstacle. This is probably an issue.
           Obstacle 10: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)) - This is an obstacle around (-0.5, 2).
           
           Given that the target is (0.47, 2.15) and obstacle 9 is ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)), the target point is *inside* this obstacle. This means it is likely not a valid target or the obstacle definition is an enclosure. Assuming it's an enclosure, I need to place the robot *outside* this enclosure to see the target. This strongly suggests placing the robot further away from the obstacle.
           
           My previous position (1.8, 0.4) was for a *different* target point and failed. It's not directly applicable here for this target, but it shows that there can be occlusions even if there are no collisions.
           
           I will try to place the robot in different directions from the target, considering the obstacles near the top boundary (y=2.5) and the obstacles around the target point itself (obstacle 9 and 19). I need to ensure there's a line of sight *around* obstacle 9.
           
           Positions:
           (-1 1)
           (1.5 1.5)
           (0.4 0.5)
