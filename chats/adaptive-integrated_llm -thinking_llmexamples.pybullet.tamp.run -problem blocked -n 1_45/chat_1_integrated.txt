User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.288, -0.336, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.859, 0.513).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.335, -0.383), (-4.241, -0.288)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Path to `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan: I need to satisfy the axiom `new-axiom@0()`, which boils down to getting object `v8` onto object `v18` and ensuring their types match. Since the initial state already confirms the types, the real challenge is positioning `v8` on `v18`.
           
           Analyzing the initial state, I see that I can pick either `v12` or `v8` as green and it already knows the type.  I am going to say `v8` since it looks more promising.  From what is known from the initial state, v8 is currently supported by v9 and has a pose at v9, which means v8 is on v11 in the initial state.  However, v8 is also supported by #o2 on v18 in the initial state.
           
           The key is to leverage the "on" axiom, which necessitates a "supported" relationship and the correct "atpose." I need to find a suitable pose `?p` where `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` holds true and then move `v8` to that pose.
           
           Looking at the initial state, `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is already true. Therefore, if I can achieve `atpose(v8, #o2)`, I'm golden. The currently known pose `v9` won't work, so I need to move from `v9` to `#o2`.
           
           The solution: a classic pick-and-place strategy! First, I'll use the `pick` action to grasp `v8` from its current pose `v9`.  The initial state gives `kin` facts that tells the robot how to pick up v8 and place it at v16. However, I need to place it at `#o2`. I need to move it and then use the `place` action to reposition `v8` onto `#o2`, which in turn, has the right `supported` fact with `v18`.
           
           **Picking and Placing**
           
           The robot (v4) will pick the object v8 using some grasp, let's say `#o1`. The pick action has preconditions related to kinematics (kin), grasp (grasp), and base configuration (atbconf) and that nothing else is in the way (NegatedAtoms). It requires the arm to have `atbconf(#o3)`. The provided "kin" facts seem to suggest that `#o3` must be the current base configuration `v3`, since that is the only `bconf` value present. Also, the pick and place facts depend on `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)` which can only be achieved if `#o3` is `v3`
           
           Assuming the base robot stays at the home position (v3), and that the collision-free conditions are met (this is not explicitly given, so I have to assume that v8 does not collide with other static obstacles, or itself, while being moved).  So, the "pick" action becomes: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)`.
           
           After picking, the object v8 will be grasped by v4.
           
           Next, I need to place v8.
           
           The `place` action needs a kin, a base configuration (atbconf), and nothing blocking it (NegatedAtoms). The "atgrasp" will be already satisfied, if I just "pick" before.  For it to be stable, the pose has to be stable and no blocking approach or trajectory. The plan for place looks good. `Kin` facts from the initial state tells me how it should be placed with grasp #o1:
           
           So, the action `(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. After place, there will be `atpose(v8, #o2)`.
           
           This places the object, satisfies `on(v8, v18)`, and satisfies the goal `new-axiom@0()`.
           
           **The Continuous Value for `#o2`**
           
           Now, about that continuous value for `#o2`. It's a pose, a specific position in space where I want `v8` to reside and has `supported`.  The key here is that v8 can be stable and supported at #o2. Based on the AABBs, I can say where this is: object  `v18` has an AABB `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. This surface can have something supported. Object `v8` has an object AABB `((4

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Problem's Limitations**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a restricted action space, just a single `move_base` action, and a goal that requires object manipulation.  My initial instinct, based on the `pick` and `place` actions in my previous plan, won't work. Those actions simply aren't valid here.  The only thing I can do is move the robot's base.
           
           The target is `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially means I need to get a green object *on* something.  I can identify `v8` as a potential green object, which satisfies the `type` constraint.  But to satisfy the remaining `on` predicate, I need `on(v8, v18)`. This unravels into `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)`.
           
           Looking at the initial state, `v8` is already *supported* by `#o2`. So I really just need to *move* `v8` to that position `#o2`. This is where I hit the wall.  I'm currently in the state `atpose(v8, v9)`.  But with *only* `move_base` available, there is no way for me to change `v8`'s pose from `v9` to `#o2`. I can't directly manipulate objects. I need `pick` and `place` capabilities, which are absent.  The problem, as it stands, is unsolvable.  The goal is unreachable with the given constraints.
