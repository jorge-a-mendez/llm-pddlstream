           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.288, -0.336, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.859, 0.513).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.335, -0.383), (-4.241, -0.288)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment & Goal Understanding**
           
           My primary objective is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to ensuring an object, specifically `?green` (which can be `v8` or `v12`), is placed "on" surface `v18` and that it has the appropriate "type" (`v17`). The initial state shows `v8` and `v12` are objects of `type v17`.
           
           **Action Plan - Detailed Breakdown**
           
           The plan must achieve the goal by leveraging available objects (v8, v12) and actions such as `pick`, `place`, and `move_base`. Given the robot’s initial state (`atbconf(v3)`, `handempty(v4)`, `atpose(v8, v9)` and that neither `v8` nor `v12` is initially `on v18`. Therefore, the chosen plan will consist of the following steps:
           1.  **Move Base:** I’ll reposition the base from `v3` to configuration `#o3` using trajectory `#o0`. This action is necessary because the initial base configuration `v3` doesn’t allow for the necessary pick and place actions.
           2.  **Pick:** Using arm `v4`, I’ll pick up object `v8` from its current pose `v9`. The grasp is achieved through grasp `#o1` using trajectory `#o4`.
           3.  **Place:** Then, the object `v8` will be placed "on" `v18` at the target pose `#o2`  with the grasp `#o1` and the arm trajectory `#o4`.
           
           **Rationale & Optimization**
           
           -   `v8` is preferred to `v12` because the initial robot configuration `v3` is closer to the `v8` location (`v9`) than `v12`'s location. This translates into less `move_base` action distance and therefore `total-cost`.
           -   I have defined `Pose for v8 on v18`: I set `#o2` to `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`. This ensures `v8` is fully within the x,y bounds of `v18`,  The z-coordinate aligns with the initial pose of the object, and the orientation reflects no rotation, making the placement safe.
           
           **Key Assumptions**
           
           I'm making a few key assumptions for now:
           -   Unsafe approach, unsafe pose, and unsafe trajectory preconditions are safe since there is no data to suggest they're unsafe in the system.
           -   The robot's base motion is simplified by only moving a small distance to pick and place.
           -   The continuous value `#o2` is `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`.
           
           **Outcome**
           
           Executing this plan achieves the goal by placing the object `v8`, of type `v17`, "on" the surface `v18`.
