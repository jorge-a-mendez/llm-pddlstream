User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.288, -0.336, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.859, 0.513).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.335, -0.383), (-4.241, -0.288)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v14)
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom pose(v15, v16)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom graspable(v15)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom stackable(v15, v10)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom type(v12, v17)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom type(v8, v17)
           Atom stackable(v8, v18)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom stackable(v12, v18)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially translates to finding a green object, `?green`, and placing it on `v18`. More specifically, I need to make `on(?green, v18)` true *and* ensure `type(?green, v17)` is true. I know from the initial state that objects `v12` and `v8` fit the `type(?green, v17)` criteria. Now, the key lies in the `on` predicate. I need to get either `v12` or `v8` onto `v18`.
           
           My thinking went like this: `on(?o, ?r)` is true if `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)` are true. The problem specifies that only `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))` is a valid action. Therefore, I can't use `pick` or `place`.
           
           I started by looking at `v12`. I need to make `on(v12, v18)` true. From the initial state, I know that `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` is true. So, if `atpose(v12, #o2)` could be achieved, I'd have a solution. But the problem is that `atpose(v12, v13)` is currently true. To change `atpose(v12, v13)` to `atpose(v12, #o2)` requires picking it from `v13` and placing it at `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           The same logic applies to `v8`. The initial state supports `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`, but `atpose(v8, v9)` is true. To achieve `on(v8, v18)`, I'd need to change its pose using actions.
           
           The issue is this: *I cannot change the pose of any object because the actions to do so, like `pick` and `place`, are not available actions.* The only available action, `move_base`, is a no-op that does not affect the pose of any object. Given that I'm confined to initial pose facts. Since I cannot change object poses, I'm stuck with the initial state which gives us these `on` facts: `on(v12, v14)`, `on(v8, v11)`, `on(v15, v11)`. None of these have `v18` as the surface. Therefore, the goal is unachievable given the constraint on allowable action instances.
