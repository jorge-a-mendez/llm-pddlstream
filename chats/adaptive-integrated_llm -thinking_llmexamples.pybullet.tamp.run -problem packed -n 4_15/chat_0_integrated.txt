User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.243, -0.578), (-0.156, -0.49)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.197, 0.349), (0.279, 0.431)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.165, -0.288), (-0.08, -0.204)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.196, -0.073), (0.291, 0.021)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.2, -0.534, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.804, 0.595).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.238, 0.39, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.769, 0.64).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.122, -0.246, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.786, 0.618).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.244, -0.026, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.97, 0.245).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **Strategic Overview: A Detailed Plan for Object Relocation**
           
           My primary objective is to strategically relocate four distinct objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) from their initial resting surface, v11, to the designated target surface, v18. The current state is straightforward: all objects are situated on v11, and the robot, with its base fixed at v3, is ready to execute the necessary manipulations. My approach is to meticulously pick up each object, transport it to v18, and precisely place it in a collision-free configuration.
           
           My initial assessment of the objects' properties is critical. Each object is graspable and stackable on v18. This informs my plan, allowing me to focus on the 'pick and place' sequence. Each object is grasped via the same `#o1` grasp and placed using a particular pose `#o2`.
           
           **Execution Steps: The Precise Choreography**
           
           1.  **Object 1: v8**
           
               *   Utilize arm v4 to pick up v8, leveraging the kin and trajectory `#t_pick_v8`.
               *   Precisely place v8 onto v18 at the predetermined coordinates: `(#o2 v8 v18): (-0.08 -0.08 0.781 0.0)`, using the kin and trajectory `#t_place_v8`.
           
           2.  **Object 2: v12**
           
               *   With arm v4, grasp v12, employing kin and trajectory `#t_pick_v12`.
               *   Place v12 on v18 at the position `(#o2 v12 v18): (0.08 -0.08 0.781 0.0)`, using the kin and trajectory `#t_place_v12`.
           
           3.  **Object 3: v14**
           
               *   Using arm v4, acquire v14, via kin and trajectory `#t_pick_v14`.
               *   Place v14 on v18 at `(#o2 v14 v18): (-0.08 0.08 0.781 0.0)`, via kin and trajectory `#t_place_v14`.
           
           4.  **Object 4: v16**
           
               *   Employing arm v4, pick up v16, using kin and trajectory `#t_pick_v16`.
               *   Finally, place v16 onto v18 at `(#o2 v16 v18): (0.08 0.08 0.781 0.0)`, utilizing kin and trajectory `#t_place_v16`.
           
           **Poses Configuration:** I have defined a specific continuous value for each object `#o2` on v18 to satisfy the requirement of separate poses given the constraints.
           
           **Plan Assurance:** The cost of the plan will be 8 (4 picks + 4 places). It's the most efficient plan. This process ensures each object is moved to the target surface v18, fulfilling the stated objective in a structured, collision-free, and cost-effective manner.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #t1) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #t2) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #t3) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #t4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #t5) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #t6) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #t7) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #t8)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Invalid Plan**
           
           Okay, so the plan they provided is a bust.  I immediately saw that the `pick` and `place` actions aren't even defined as possibilities within the available action instances. All we can do is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  Essentially, the robot is stuck at its current position, which is a real problem.
           
           The problem they're trying to solve involves getting objects at various locations to end up "on" `v18`.  That requires moving things around, which, given the limited action space, is simply impossible.  I mean, how can we *get* the objects to `v18` if we can't move them?
           
           It's clear that with the current action definitions, the goal is unreachable. We need to expand the action space to include actions like `pick` and `place` if we have any chance of solving this.
