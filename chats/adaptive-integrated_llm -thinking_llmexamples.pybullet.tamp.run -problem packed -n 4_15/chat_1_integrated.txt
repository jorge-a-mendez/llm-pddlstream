User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.243, -0.578), (-0.156, -0.49)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.197, 0.349), (0.279, 0.431)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.165, -0.288), (-0.08, -0.204)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.196, -0.073), (0.291, 0.021)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.2, -0.534, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.804, 0.595).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.238, 0.39, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.769, 0.64).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.122, -0.246, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.786, 0.618).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.244, -0.026, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.97, 0.245).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Unreachable Goal: A Problem of Base Configuration**
           
           My analysis indicates that the provided goal is unattainable.  My objective is to move four objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) onto object v18. The problem I'm facing is the robot's base configuration.
           
           Here's my thought process:
           
           *   **Understanding the Goal and Initial State:**  The goal requires placing all four objects onto v18. Initially, these objects are on v11.  The necessary action for moving an object onto another object is defined by the *on* predicate and requires the robot to *pick* and *place* objects on the correct poses.
           *   **The Constraint of Base Configuration:** All available kinematic facts (*kin* predicates) for picking and placing objects explicitly require the robot to be in base configuration `#o3` (`atbconf(#o3)`).
           *   **The Robot's Current State and the Lack of Mobility:**  However, the initial state shows the robot is currently at base configuration `v3` (`atbconf(v3)`).  The only available `move_base` action instance is a no-op that keeps the robot at `v3`.
           *   **The Implication of the Inability to Change:** There are no provided actions to transition the robot's base configuration from `v3` to `#o3`. Furthermore, the only motion the robot *can* perform is a no-op from `v3` to `v3`.
           *   **The Conclusion:**  Because the *pick* and *place* actions need the robot to be at a base configuration that is currently unreachable, I am unable to fulfill the desired goal of moving the objects onto v18. This is a problem of base configuration, the goal is unreachable.
