           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, two stores, v16, several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8), several objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20), a lander (v9), a camera (v10), and a mode (v11). Both rovers are at their initial configurations, v13 and v15 respectively, and both have access to the store v16. The camera v10 is onboard both rovers and supports mode v11.
           
           The goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom representing a complex state. Examining the definition of `new-axiom@0()`, we see it requires:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is true initially.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is true initially.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: This is true initially.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: This is true initially.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This requires a rover to take an image of v17 in mode v11 and send it.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This requires a rover to take an image of v18 in mode v11 and send it.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This requires a rover to take an image of v19 in mode v11 and send it.
           - `receivedimage(v20, v11)`: This requires a rover to take an image of v20 in mode v11 and send it.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: This is true initially for v1, v3, v4.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means a rock of type v2 (a stone) needs to be analyzed and the analysis sent.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: This is true initially for v5, v7, v8.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means a rock of type v6 (soil) needs to be analyzed and the analysis sent.
           
           The available actions are very limited: only `move` and `drop_rock` for both rovers, and both `move` actions just move the rover to its current configuration. This implies that the rovers cannot change their configuration. Therefore, any action requiring a change in configuration (e.g., `imagevisible` at `#o3` or `comvisible` at `#o0` that are not the current configuration) must be considered carefully. The problem provides that `#o3` and `#o0` are configurations which could be different from `v13` and `v15`, but also that the only `move` actions available are to the current configurations. This suggests that the rovers are static.
           
           Let's re-examine the initial state and goal with the constraint of no movement:
           `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are true and will remain true.
           `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true and can be modified by `sample_rock` and `drop_rock`.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage` for v17, v18, v19, v20 in mode v11:
           We need to use `take_image` then `send_image`.
           The `imagevisible` predicates show both v12 and v14 can see all these objectives from configuration `#o3`.
           The `comvisible` predicates show both v12 and v14 can communicate with lander v9 from configuration `#o0`.
           Since the rovers cannot move, this means we *must* be able to perform `take_image` and `send_image` from `v13` or `v15`. However, the initial state shows `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates for `#o3` and `#o0`, which are *not* `v13` or `v15`. Since we cannot move to `#o3` or `#o0`, and the `take_image` and `send_image` actions require `atconf(?v, ?q)` to match the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` configuration, these actions cannot be performed.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis` for a rock of type v2 and a rock of type v6:
           We need to use `sample_rock` then `send_analysis`.
           The `above` predicates show both v12 and v14 are above multiple rocks from configuration `#o5`.
           Similar to the image and communication actions, the `sample_rock` action requires `atconf(?v, ?q)` to match the `above` configuration `#o5`. Since rovers cannot move from `v13` or `v15` to `#o5`, `sample_rock` cannot be performed.
           
           Given that the only available `move` actions are self-moves (moving to the current configuration), and the `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` predicates are all linked to configurations (`#o3`, `#o0`, `#o5`) that are *not* the current rover configurations (`v13`, `v15`), it is impossible to satisfy the preconditions for `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. Therefore, the goal `new-axiom@0()` which requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` cannot be achieved.
           
           The problem statement mentions: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration..." This implies that these '#' configurations are potential locations the rover *could* be at. However, the *only* available `move` actions are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`. This means that even if `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` are valid collision-free configurations, the rovers have no way to reach them from their starting positions `v13` and `v15`.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
