           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single surface, surface 0, which is a rectangular area. The object is also rectangular. I need to find 50 stable placements for the object on surface 0. Stability means the object must be fully contained within the bounds of the surface. Since it's a new request, there are no previously placed objects to consider for collision avoidance.
           
           The object's dimensions are approximately 0.07x0.07. The surface 0 is defined by `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. This means the surface has a width of `4.8 - 4.2 = 0.6` and a height of `0.0 - (-0.6) = 0.6`. The object is quite small relative to the surface.
           
           I can place the object at various (x,y) positions within the surface and at different orientations (theta). For a stable placement, the center of the object (x,y) must be such that no part of the object extends beyond the surface boundaries.
           
           Let `obj_size_x = 0.07` and `obj_size_y = 0.07`.
           For a rotation of `theta = 0` or `theta = pi/2`, the effective dimensions are `obj_size_x` and `obj_size_y`.
           For `theta = 0`:
           `min_x = surf_lower_x + obj_size_x/2 = 4.2 + 0.035 = 4.235`
           `max_x = surf_upper_x - obj_size_x/2 = 4.8 - 0.035 = 4.765`
           `min_y = surf_lower_y + obj_size_y/2 = -0.6 + 0.035 = -0.565`
           `max_y = surf_upper_y - obj_size_y/2 = 0.0 - 0.035 = -0.035`
           
           For a rotated object, the effective half-width and half-height for containment are `(obj_size_x * abs(cos(theta)) + obj_size_y * abs(sin(theta))) / 2` and `(obj_size_x * abs(sin(theta)) + obj_size_y * abs(cos(theta))) / 2`. Since `obj_size_x` and `obj_size_y` are nearly equal, the effective half-dimensions will be approximately `0.07 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))) / 2`. The maximum value of `abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))` is `sqrt(2)` at `theta = pi/4`. So the effective half-dimension is at most `0.07 * sqrt(2) / 2 = 0.0495`. This is still very small compared to the surface dimensions.
           
           I will generate placements by varying x, y, and theta. I will mostly use `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/2` for simplicity, and also include some `pi/4` rotations.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have received a new request. The previous placements for object ID 5 were successful. This new request is for a different object, ID 10, on the same surface (surface 0). This means I need to find placements for object ID 10 that are stable and do not collide with any of the previously placed instances of object ID 5.
           
           The surface is `0: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.
           The new object ID 10 has dimensions `obj_size_x = 0.08574909502267403` and `obj_size_y = 0.0857490950226738`. These are approximately 0.0857 x 0.0857.
           
           The previous successful placements for object ID 5 were:
           (0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565)
           (0, 0.0, 4.765, -0.565)
           (0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.035)

           Since the new object is similar in size and square, the calculations for containment are similar.
           For `theta = 0` or `theta = pi/2`:
           `obj_half_x = 0.08574909502267403 / 2 = 0.042874547511337015`
           `obj_half_y = 0.0857490950226738 / 2 = 0.0428745475113369`
           
           `min_x = surf_lower_x + obj_half_x = 4.2 + 0.042874547511337015 = 4.242874547511337`
           `max_x = surf_upper_x - obj_half_x = 4.8 - 0.042874547511337015 = 4.757125452488663`
           `min_y = surf_lower_y + obj_half_y = -0.6 + 0.0428745475113369 = -0.5571254524886631`
           `max_y = surf_upper_y - obj_half_y = 0.0 - 0.0428745475113369 = -0.0428745475113369`
           
           The object ID 5 has dimensions ~0.07x0.07, and object ID 10 has dimensions ~0.0857x0.0857.
           The placed objects ID 5 are:
           `P1_5 = (4.235, -0.565)` half-extents 0.035
           `P2_5 = (4.765, -0.565)` half-extents 0.035
           `P3_5 = (4.235, -0.035)` half-extents 0.035
           `P4_5 = (4.765, -0.035)` half-extents 0.035
           `P5_5 = (4.5, -0.3)` half-extents 0.035
           
           I need to make sure the new object's AABB (considering rotation) does not overlap with the AABBs of these previously placed objects.
           Let's consider the AABB for object ID 5.
           Lower X: `center_x - obj5_half_x`
           Upper X: `center_x + obj5_half_x`
           Lower Y: `center_y - obj5_half_y`
           Upper Y: `center_y + obj5_half_y`
           
           For example, for the first placed object ID 5 at (4.235, -0.565) with 0 rotation, its AABB is:
           `X: [4.235 - 0.035, 4.235 + 0.035] = [4.2, 4.27]`
           `Y: [-0.565 - 0.035, -0.565 + 0.035] = [-0.6, -0.53]`
           
           I will generate placements that avoid these regions. The corners and center of the surface are already occupied by object 5, and object 10 is slightly larger. I'll try to place object 10 near the edges but not precisely on the corners, and also in the gaps between the object 5 placements.
           
           A good approach might be to place new objects along the middle of the surface, but off-center from the existing ones. The surface is 0.6x0.6.
           The existing objects are at 4.235, 4.765 along X, and -0.565, -0.035 along Y, and 4.5, -0.3 at the center.
           
           I can place objects around `x = 4.2 + (0.6/2) = 4.5` and `y = -0.6 + (0.6/2) = -0.3`, but the center `(4.5, -0.3)` is already taken by object 5.
           
           Let's try to place them in the gaps. For example, between `x = 4.235` and `x = 4.5`.
           The available x-range for object 10 is `[4.24287, 4.75712]`.
           The available y-range for object 10 is `[-0.55712, -0.04287]`.
           
           Consider the gaps:
           X-gaps: `[4.2, 4.235]`, `[4.27, 4.5-0.035] = [4.27, 4.465]`, `[4.5+0.035, 4.73] = [4.535, 4.73]`, `[4.765, 4.8]`
           Y-gaps: `[-0.6, -0.565]`, `[-0.53, -0.3-0.035] = [-0.53, -0.335]`, `[-0.3+0.035, -0.07] = [-0.265, -0.07]`, `[-0.035, 0.0]`
           
           The half-width of object 10 is ~0.04287.
           So, valid `x` must be at least `4.2 + 0.04287 = 4.24287` and at most `4.8 - 0.04287 = 4.75713`.
           Valid `y` must be at least `-0.6 + 0.04287 = -0.55713` and at most `0.0 - 0.04287 = -0.04287`.
           
           I'll try to place the object in regions that are not close to the centers of object 5.
           For example, along x=4.3 or x=4.7 and y=-0.2 or y=-0.4.
           Many of the previous placements for object 5 were near the corners or center.
           The space between `x=4.235` and `x=4.5` (center of object 5) or `x=4.765` for obj 5.
           Let's try a placement at `x=4.35` and `y=-0.45` with theta=0.
           Object 5 at (4.5, -0.3) has x-range [4.465, 4.535] and y-range [-0.335, -0.265].
           Object 5 at (4.235, -0.565) has x-range [4.2, 4.27] and y-range [-0.6, -0.53].
           Object 5 at (4.765, -0.565) has x-range [4.73, 4.8] and y-range [-0.6, -0.53].
           Object 5 at (4.235, -0.035) has x-range [4.2, 4.27] and y-range [-0.07, 0.0].
           Object 5 at (4.765, -0.035) has x-range [4.73, 4.8] and y-range [-0.07, 0.0].
           
           My new placement candidate `(4.35, -0.45)` with half-extents 0.04287 will have:
           X range: `[4.35 - 0.04287, 4.35 + 0.04287] = [4.30713, 4.39287]`
           Y range: `[-0.45 - 0.04287, -0.45 + 0.04287] = [-0.49287, -0.40713]`
           This range does not overlap with any of the object 5 AABBs listed above. This is a good candidate.
           
           I will generate many such placements, ensuring they are within surface bounds and do not overlap with the object 5 placements. I'll focus on the 'empty' central regions and some intermediate points.
