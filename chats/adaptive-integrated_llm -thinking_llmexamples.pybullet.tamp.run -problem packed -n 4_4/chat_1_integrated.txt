User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object

           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.151, -0.378), (0.228, -0.301)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.011, -0.564), (0.087, -0.466)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.123, 0.232), (0.215, 0.324)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.191, 0.352), (-0.109, 0.434)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.189, -0.339, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.671, 0.741).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.038, -0.515, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.949, 0.317).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.169, 0.278, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.551, 0.834).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.15, 0.393, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.632, 0.775).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've got to get these four objects – v8, v12, v14, and v16 – onto v18. Seems straightforward enough: each object needs to be picked up from its starting spot on v11 and then placed down on v18. The robot has the arm, v4, and it's currently empty, handempty(v4), and the base is in configuration v3, atbconf(v3).
           
           The key here is the "kin" facts, which tell me what actions are possible. I can pick and place each object, because the kin predicate is given.  I see these `kin` facts for placement at `#o2` on `v18`: `kin(v4, <object>, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`. It seems like I need to figure out appropriate positions for placement. I know the robot is starting with an empty hand, the base is in the correct configuration, and that the pick and place actions must be "safe".
           
           Now, I've got to generate these continuous parameter values for each of the `#o2` placements. I'm going to set `theta=0` which means quaternion (0,0,0,1).  I'll place them in a 2x2 grid on v18, placing centers at `(-0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)`, `(0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)`, `(-0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)`, `(0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           
           Here's the planned action sequence:
           
           1.  Pick v8 from its location, v9, on v11.  This action is: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           2.  Place v8 at the previously calculated coordinate  #o2. This action is: `(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           3.  Pick v12 from its location, v13, on v11. This action is: `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           4.  Place v12 at the previously calculated coordinate #o2. This action is: `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           5.  Pick v14 from its location, v15, on v11. This action is: `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           6.  Place v14 at the previously calculated coordinate #o2. This action is: `(place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           7.  Pick v16 from its location, v17, on v11. This action is: `(pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           8.  Place v16 at the previously calculated coordinate #o2. This action is: `(place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           
           And it must be complete now.  Each pick will create the precondition for placement and should be the minimal cost to achieve the goal: all objects will be on v18.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of the Task**
           
           Okay, so the previous plan was flawed, as the user pointed out.  The only valid action instance we have is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This moves the robot's base from its current position, `v3`, to the *exact same* position, `v3`, using the trajectory `#o0`. That doesn't achieve anything useful.
           
           The goal we're aiming for is to have objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` all located *on* surface `v18`.  In other words, we need `on(v8, v18)`, `on(v12, v18)`, `on(v14, v18)`, and `on(v16, v18)`.
           
           The problem is that our only available action, `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, does *nothing* to manipulate these objects. It sets `canmove()` to false and changes nothing else. The initial state shows the objects are on `v11`, not `v18`, and all the necessary conditions for `on` are supported in the initial state by the presence of `supported`.
           
           We need to pick these objects up and place them on the table, `v18`. This is simply not feasible with the action we have. *We can't pick up or place anything* with a move action that doesn't go anywhere.
           
           Therefore, given *only* the action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, the current goal is fundamentally unreachable.  It's a simple planning impossibility. We need a different set of actions to even begin to make progress.
