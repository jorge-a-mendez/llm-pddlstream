User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.44, 0.059), (-4.348, 0.152)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.394, 0.105, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.837, 0.546).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v14)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)

           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom pose(v15, v16)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom stackable(v12, v18)
           Atom graspable(v15)
           Atom stackable(v15, v10)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains several objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v15` are graspable objects. `v14` is a surface where `v12` is supported. `v11` is a surface where `v8` and `v15` are supported. `v18` is another surface. `v10` is a dummy surface. The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`. `v3` is the initial base configuration.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` implies the state `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. From the initial state, we know `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`. This means either `v8` or `v12` needs to be `on` `v18`. Since `v12` is currently on `v14` and `v8` is on `v11`, and we only have one available action which is a `move_base` action that doesn't change the state of objects, the goal is not achievable. There are no pick or place actions to move objects.
           
           I apologize, but I made a mistake in the previous assessment. The available action list provided only included `move_base`, and there were no actions to pick or place objects. However, given the axioms for `new-axiom@0()`, the goal is `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. In the initial state, `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)` are true. This means the goal is to place either `v8` or `v12` on `v18`. Since `v8` is currently at `v9` and supported by `v11`, and `v12` is at `v13` and supported by `v14`, we need to move one of them to `v18`.
           
           However, the only action instance available is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not change the position of any objects. Without pick and place actions, it's impossible to move `v8` or `v12` to `v18`. Therefore, the goal is unreachable with the given set of allowed actions.
