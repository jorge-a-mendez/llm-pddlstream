(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for a Square Object**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find 50 stable positions for a square object (ID 5, dimensions 0.0743 x 0.0743) on a larger square surface (Surface 0, from -0.135 to 0.135 on each axis).  A "stable" placement means the object is fully inside the surface, doesn't collide with anything else, and we haven't been given any other constraints to worry about yet.
           
           Since the object's a square, its dimensions are constant regardless of its rotation. This simplifies things!  The placement criteria boil down to making sure the object's center point (x, y) is within a specific range, considering its half-extents (which are 0.0743 / 2 = 0.03715).
           
           My first step is to calculate the valid range for the center (x, y) coordinates.  For Surface 0, the valid x range will be from -0.135 + 0.03715 to 0.135 - 0.03715.  That's about -0.09785 to 0.09785.  The y range will be the same due to the square shape.
           
           Now, to get 50 different positions, I need to spread them out across this range.  I'm thinking of a grid approach to efficiently distribute these points. 7 points along the x-axis and 7 points along the y-axis, for a 7x7 grid. That will give 49 different placements and cover the maximum area.
           
           Since it is a square the rotation angles don't affect the object size, but for diversity I will choose 0, pi/4, pi/2, and 3pi/4.
           
           For the 50th, let's just make it simple, (0, 0) with a pi/4 angle or pi/2.
           
           Let's do some more math to verify the exact ranges and step sizes.
           The AABB that defines the object's size *will* be different when rotated and therefore that range for x and y change with `theta`.
           The unrotated half-extents, is `h = 0.03715`. When theta is pi/4, the effective size will be multiplied by sqrt(2) and will therefore the effective size will change.
           
           Let me calculate the effective `x` and `y` range. The range is at its maximum at 0 and at a minimum at pi/4.
           
           I am redoing the strategy: 
           - 49 points at theta = 0, will have the biggest valid area
           - 1 with the point at (0, 0) with pi/4
           
           Then, for theta = 0, the object will have valid ranges for x and y of [-0.09784, 0.09784].
           This would look something like [-0.09784, -0.06523, -0.03262, 0, 0.03262, 0.06523, 0.09784].
           
           For the 50th, theta will equal pi/4 and will have a smaller, valid range.
           For theta = pi/4, h_eff will be h * sqrt(2) = 0.05255470162590748. Then [-0.08245, 0.08245].
           
           For the coordinates, I will generate a 7x7 grid using the precise range for theta 0. Then for the 50th, (0, 0) with pi/4.

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's break this down for object 4.**  I've got a successful placement for object 5, and now I need to find 50 stable, non-colliding locations for object 4 on the same surface.  This is a square object, about 0.0804 units per side.  Object 5 is also a square, but slightly smaller.
           
           First, I define the surface, a rectangle, and get the AABB of the already-placed object 5, centered at `(0, 0, -0.0978)`. Object 5's position is very close to the lower-left corner of surface 0.  Since the AABB of object 4 depends on the object's rotation `theta`, I need to calculate different AABB dimensions for `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/4`.
           
           I start by building a 7x7 grid of candidate center positions for object 4 at `theta = 0` across the surface, and filter out those that would collide with the pre-existing object 5. The basic approach is as follows. I have calculated the bounding box of the previous object and the range that I can place object 4 inside without going off the surface. I will then pick a grid of placements in that range, and check if they overlap, and if so, remove it from the placement list. This gives 40 valid placements for object 4 with no rotation.
           
           Now, it's time to find 10 more placements. I build a 3x3 grid centered around `(0, 0)` for `theta = pi/4`, and check each location. This will give 8 valid positions for theta=pi/4.
           
           I need 2 more, and it's easy, since it's a square. I simply take 2 points from the 40 points in the `theta=0` configuration and set their theta to pi/2, for the remaining 2 placements to get to 50. I'll pick `(0, 0)` and `(0.031605, 0)` to be safe.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 6 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I need to place 50 stable instances of object ID 6 on surface 0, and I need to make sure they don't collide with objects 4 and 5, which are already there. Let's break this down:
           
           *   **Object Properties:** Object 6 is essentially a square, roughly 0.0766 units on each side.  Its half-extents (hx and hy) are 0.03828. I'll use 0.03828 for simplicity in the calculations.
           *   **Surface:** Surface 0 is a square area with corners at (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135).
           *   **Existing Objects and AABBs:**
               *   **Object 5:**  Is at (0, 0, -0.097842, -0.097842) with dimensions 0.0743.  Its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) goes roughly from (-0.135, -0.135) to (-0.0607, -0.0607).
               *   **Object 4:** Is at (0, 0, -0.094815, -0.031605) with dimensions 0.0804.  Its AABB goes roughly from (-0.135, -0.0718) to (-0.0546, 0.0086).
           *   **Occupied Space:** Combining the AABBs of objects 4 and 5, the approximate occupied region is a rectangle that extends from -0.135 to -0.0546 along the x-axis and from -0.135 to 0.0086 along the y-axis.
           
           **Placement Constraints**
           
           *   **Theta = 0:** I'll start with theta=0 (no rotation) to maximize the use of available space. With no rotation, the valid center region for object 6 is a square with corners at approximately (-0.09672, -0.09672) and (0.09672, 0.09672).  I'll use a 7x7 grid within this valid region to find candidate placement points.
               I calculated 37 valid placement spots with 0 rotation.
           *   **Theta = pi/4:** Rotating the object by pi/4 reduces the space for placement. Using a 3x3 grid, I found 7 more valid placement options in this case.
               The goal is 50 placements, and I now have 44. To achieve this, I pick 6 from the spots at `theta=0`.
           *   **Final Candidate List**
               With the help of collision checks, I found a way to achieve the goal:
               *37 placements at theta = 0*
               *7 placements at theta = pi/4*
               *6 placements at theta = pi/2*
           
           The final plan is to generate points within this area, checking that the object, at its specific angle, does not intersect the AABBs of the other objects. I will use the established grid, and some additions.

               I calculated 37 valid placement spots with 0 rotation.
           *   **Theta = pi/4:** Rotating the object by pi/4 reduces the space for placement. Using a 3x3 grid, I found 7 more valid placement options in this case.
               The goal is 50 placements, and I now have 44. To achieve this, I pick 6 from the spots at `theta=0`.

               *6 placements at theta = pi/2*
