           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Here's how I'm approaching this:**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5) on a square surface.  The object's dimensions are roughly 0.085 units by 0.085 units, and the surface spans from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). A stable placement means the object must be entirely within the surface.
           
           Since the object is square, its orientation (theta) doesn't significantly impact whether it fits within the surface's AABB; however, I'll provide a `theta` value as it's part of the output requirements.  I'll set it to 0 for most placements to keep things simple.
           
           To ensure stability, I need to constrain the object's center coordinates (x, y). The object's half-width and half-height are approximately 0.042, and so the object's center must be offset within the surface bounds. After calculating this, I found the object can only move within the range `[-0.0925..., 0.0925...]` along both the x and y axes.
           
           To create diverse placements within this valid range, I've decided to employ a structured approach. I'll use a 7x7 grid to generate 49 placements, spaced out evenly within the valid area. This results in evenly spaced locations. To reach the required 50 placements, I'll add an additional placement at the center of the surface, with a `theta` value of pi/4, to add a bit of variety.
           
           Since this is the first instance of object ID 5, there are no prior placements of object 5 to worry about.

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's break down this placement problem.** I've got a previously placed object (ID 5) in a specific location on Surface 0, which is a square. Now, I need to place a new square object (ID 7) on the same surface, ensuring it doesn't collide with object 5. My goal is to generate a diverse set of 50 valid placements for object 7.
           
           First, I need to establish the safe placement area for object 7.  The surface's dimensions give me the initial bounds, and I calculate the possible range for the center of object 7. Then, I define the collision area to avoid the already-placed object 5. Object 5 effectively occupies the bottom-left corner of the surface.  Since both objects are squares, rotation won't change their collision boxes (AABBs), but different rotations will be included for generating diverse placements.
           
           To avoid collision, the center of object 7 must not lie within a certain region around object 5. To generate placements, I'm going to set up a 7x7 grid for candidate x, y positions. This grid will cover the surface, but I'll filter out any grid points that would cause a collision.
           
           Since it's square, if its center is not in the forbidden space, its placement will not collide with the previous object. I'll take the first 40 valid grid points and use `theta = 0`, then the next 10 and apply `theta = pi/4`. This should generate enough "diverse placements". Finally, I check to make sure the placements don't overlap.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Avoiding Collisions**
           
           Alright, here's the plan. I've got to find 50 stable spots for Object ID 8 on Surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into previously placed Objects 5 and 7. The surface is just a rectangle, from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           First, I need to figure out where I *can't* place Object 8.  I've already calculated the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for Objects 5 and 7. Object 5's AABB is  ((-0.135, -0.135), (-0.05011658495483755, -0.05011658495483755)).  Object 7's AABB is ((-0.135, -0.039624471430690705), (-0.0557510571386186, 0.039624471430690705)).  Object 8 is a square with side length 0.09561627059651992, so its half-dimension (h8) is 0.04780813529825996.
           
           To be within Surface 0, Object 8's center has to fall within a certain range: x has to be in [-0.087, 0.087] and y has to be in [-0.087, 0.087].  But, I need to avoid overlap with 5 and 7.
           
           I'm setting up a grid of 10x10 points across the valid placement area for Object 8.  For each point, I'll calculate the corners of the Object 8's AABB, and see if it overlaps with Object 5's AABB and/or Object 7's AABB.  I'll use a standard AABB intersection check.
           
           If there's *any* overlap, that point is out.  I'll only keep the points that avoid both objects. The AABB intersection check, `max(a.min_x, b.min_x) < min(a.max_x, b.max_x)` for x and y, is simple enough. I'll test each point on the grid.
           
           The script, in the end, came back with 60 valid placements at theta 0. Since I only need 50, I'll take the first 50. I'm good to go!

(Thoughts: **Finding Safe Spots for Object 4**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 4) on surface 0.  I need to make sure these placements don't collide with the existing objects: 5, 7, and 8.
           
           First, I define the playing field, surface 0: a square with a known size and bounds. Then I carefully calculate the bounding boxes (AABBs) for each of the pre-existing objects. I need the exact dimensions and positions to do this right. Using the half dimensions, I correctly calculate the AABB corners for each object (5, 7, 8). This is critical for collision detection later.
           
           Next, I calculate the constraints. Object 4 needs to fit entirely *within* surface 0, giving me a smaller "safe zone" for its center. Using the object's half dimension, I compute the boundaries of this safe zone, which accounts for the object's own size.
           
           Here's the key: I'm using a grid-based approach. I'll create a 10x10 grid of potential center points for object 4 within the safe zone. For each point on the grid, I'll calculate the *hypothetical* AABB for object 4 (given its dimensions and that center). Then, I'll *rigorously* check for collisions against *every* existing AABB (5, 7, and 8).
           
           If a point *doesn't* collide, I'll mark it as a valid placement.  Since the object is square, the rotation doesn't matter for AABB overlap. But to diversify the solutions, I will rotate every second placement to give variety. I'll alternate between 0 and pi/4 rotations for my 50 solutions.
           
           The initial analysis showed there would be many valid spots. I'm taking the initial 50 valid placements and adding rotations to these to satisfy the requirements.

(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements for Object ID 6**
           
           Okay, here's my plan: I need to place object ID 6, which is a square with side length 0.09406, on surface 0, avoiding collisions with previously placed objects 5, 7, 8, and the instances of 4.  I also need to account for rotation instability seen with object 4. The main thing I learned from object 4 is that a square's *actual* bounding box changes with rotation, and I need to calculate that new effective bounding box.
           
           Here's the breakdown: First, I need to calculate the *effective* half-dimension for object 6, considering the rotations.  If the object is not rotated or rotated by 90 degrees (or multiples), the effective half-dimension *h6_effective* is just half the side, which is approximately 0.04703.  If the object is rotated by 45 degrees, the effective half-dimension *h6_effective_rotated* increases due to how the square's diagonal fits. I need to calculate this enlarged bounding box. The effective half dimension is s6 / sqrt(2) which is approximately 0.0665.
           
           Next, I need to determine the valid placement area on the surface, considering the effective half-dimensions based on the rotation. With no rotation, I can place object 6 between an x value of approximately -0.088 and 0.088, and a y value of the same. For rotation of 45 degrees, x and y are limited to between -0.068 and 0.068.
           
           I'll generate a grid of potential placement centers for object 6 for zero rotation, and if I don't get 50 solutions, I'll switch to the grid for 45 degree rotation.
           To do this I have collision checks using the axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs). I've precomputed all of the AABBs of the other objects. I will use these AABBs for collision checking.
           
           *   I check for collisions with `check_all_collisions` and is_colliding.
           I'm confident in this approach.  The grid approach should give me the 50 solutions I need.

Model:     **Generating 50 Stable Placements for Object ID 6**
           
           Okay, here's my plan: I need to place object ID 6, which is a square with side length 0.09406, on surface 0, avoiding collisions with previously placed objects 5, 7, 8, and the instances of 4.  I also need to account for rotation instability seen with object 4. The main thing I learned from object 4 is that a square's *actual* bounding box changes with rotation, and I need to calculate that new effective bounding box.
           
           Here's the breakdown: First, I need to calculate the *effective* half-dimension for object 6, considering the rotations.  If the object is not rotated or rotated by 90 degrees (or multiples), the effective half-dimension *h6_effective* is just half the side, which is approximately 0.04703.  If the object is rotated by 45 degrees, the effective half-dimension *h6_effective_rotated* increases due to how the square's diagonal fits. I need to calculate this enlarged bounding box. The effective half dimension is s6 / sqrt(2) which is approximately 0.0665.
