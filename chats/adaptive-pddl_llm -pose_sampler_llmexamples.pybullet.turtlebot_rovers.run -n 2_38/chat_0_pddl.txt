           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks us to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom defined as a conjunction of several facts. Let's break down the axiom's components:
           
           `Atom atconf(v12, v13)`: This is true in the initial state.
           `Atom atconf(v14, v15)`: This is true in the initial state.
           `Atom free(v12, v16)`: This is true in the initial state.
           `Atom free(v14, v16)`: This is true in the initial state.
           `Atom receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This needs to be achieved. `v17` is an objective and `v11` is a mode.
           `Atom receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This needs to be achieved. `v18` is an objective and `v11` is a mode.
           `Atom type(?stone, v2)`: This is true for `v1`, `v3`, `v4` in the initial state.
           `Atom receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means we need to analyze any rock of type `v2` and send the analysis.
           `Atom type(?soil, v6)`: This is true for `v5`, `v7`, `v8` in the initial state.
           `Atom receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means we need to analyze any rock of type `v6` and send the analysis.
           
           Let's examine the available actions and what they can achieve.
           The only allowed actions are `move` and `drop_rock`.
           The `move` actions are:
           `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))`
           `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`
           These actions effectively move the rovers from their current configurations to the same current configurations, meaning they don't change the rover's location.
           
           The `drop_rock` actions are:
           `((drop_rock v12 v16))`
           `((drop_rock v14 v16))`
           These actions require `full(?v, ?s)` as a precondition and will make `free(?v, ?s)` true. However, in the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are already true, meaning the stores are empty. Therefore, these `drop_rock` actions cannot be executed.
           
           Now let's consider how to achieve the goal predicates, particularly `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`.
           `receivedimage(?o, ?m)` is achieved by `send_image`.
           `receivedanalysis(?r)` is achieved by `send_analysis`.
           
           To `send_image`, we need `haveimage(?v, ?o, ?m)`. To get `haveimage`, we need to `take_image`.
           To `take_image`, we need `calibrated(?c, ?v)`. To `calibrate`, we need to execute `calibrate`.
           The `calibrate` action requires `imagevisible`, `onboard`, `atconf`, and not `blocked`.
           The `take_image` action requires `imagevisible`, `onboard`, `supports`, `atconf`, `calibrated`, and not `blocked`.
           
           To `send_analysis`, we need `analyzed(?v, ?r)`. To get `analyzed`, we need to `sample_rock`.
           To `sample_rock`, we need `above(?v, ?q, ?r)`, `store(?s)`, `atconf(?v, ?q)`, and `free(?v, ?s)`.
           
           The crucial issue here is that the only allowed action instances are `move` (which does not change configuration) and `drop_rock` (which cannot be executed due to `free` being true).
           None of these allowed actions can lead to `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`. We cannot `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` with the given allowed actions.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the provided list of allowed action instances.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`. None of these can be achieved with the given allowed actions.
           The `move` actions don't change the state in a meaningful way to enable other actions. The `drop_rock` actions are not applicable because the stores are already free. There are no actions to calibrate, take images, send images, sample rocks, or send analysis.
           
           Thus, the goal is unreachable.
