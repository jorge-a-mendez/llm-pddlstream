(Thoughts: **My Plan for Object Placement**
           
           I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for an object with ID 4, dimensions approximately 0.094 x 0.094, on a surface defined by the AABB `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. Stability means the object remains fully within the surface bounds. I know each placement is defined by `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`.
           
           Given the object is almost square, rotations won't significantly alter its bounding box's area, but the angle does affect bounding rectangle dimensions (`W` and `H`) as `W = w * abs(cos(theta)) + h * abs(sin(theta))` and `H = w * abs(sin(theta)) + h * abs(cos(theta))`, where `(w, h)` are the original dimensions.
           
           My strategy involves using two rotation angles: 0 and pi/4 (45 degrees), since this gives the max possible AABB extent.  For both, I will vary x and y values within valid ranges that ensure full containment.
           
           For `theta = 0`, the object's AABB dimensions are essentially its original dimensions. The usable center x and y ranges are then approximately `[-0.088, 0.088]`. I will use a step of 0.04 to get `x_centers_0 = [-0.08, -0.04, 0.0, 0.04, 0.08]` and `y_centers_0 = [-0.08, -0.04, 0.0, 0.04, 0.08]`.
           
           For `theta = pi/4`, the AABB width and height are 0.133, approximately. The valid ranges for x and y are roughly `[-0.0686, 0.0686]`. I'll use a step of 0.03 to create `x_centers_prime = [-0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06]` and `y_centers_prime = [-0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06]`.
           
           This results in 25 placements at `theta = 0` and 25 at `theta = pi/4`, for a total of 50. I have confirmed that each rotation at each selected center is stable.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Strategy for Placement of Object 6**
           
           Okay, I've got this. The previous request was successful, which means the general approach is sound. Now, I need to place Object 6, but it *must* avoid colliding with Object 4, which is currently at `(-0.08, -0.08)`. My plan is to first define Object 4's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) and then make sure that any potential placement of Object 6 does not overlap with this area.
           
           **Step 1: Understanding Object 4**
           
           Object 4 has dimensions of approximately 0.0938 x 0.0938, so it's nearly a perfect square.  Since `theta` is 0, its AABB is straightforward. I've calculated the min/max coordinates: `x_min_4` is about -0.127, `x_max_4` is about -0.033, `y_min_4` is about -0.127, and `y_max_4` is about -0.033. Object 4 occupies the bottom-left corner of the surface.
           
           **Step 2: Defining Object 6**
           
           Object 6 is slightly larger than Object 4, at about 0.0957 x 0.0957.  I need to generate a series of stable placements, 50 to be exact, that do not collide with Object 4.
           
           **Step 3: Collision Avoidance Strategy**
           
           To avoid collision, the AABBs of the two objects must *not* overlap.  The strategy is: two AABBs do not collide if `A.x_min >= B.x_max` OR `A.x_max <= B.x_min` OR `A.y_min >= B.y_max` OR `A.y_max <= B.y_min`.
           
           **Step 4: Surface and Placement Limitations**
           
           The surface itself is a square that goes from `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.  This gives me the placement bounds for Object 6's center.  I need to calculate those bounds for *both* rotations.
           
           **Step 5: Rotation and Sampling**
           
           I'll use two rotations: 0 degrees and 45 degrees (pi/4 radians).  For each rotation, I'll calculate valid ranges for the center coordinates (x and y) of Object 6, ensuring that the entire rotated object fits within the surface. The center ranges should be derived by using bounds. I plan to use a sampling grid with 9 x 9 or 7 x 7 points to ensure that I will have enough candidates.
           
           **Step 6: Collision Detection and Filtering**
           
           For each potential placement, I'll calculate Object 6's AABB, accounting for the rotation. Then, I will check whether the AABB overlaps Object 4's AABB.  Only the non-colliding placements will be selected. I'll pick the top 50 valid placements.
           
           **Step 7: Re-evaluation and Refinement (if necessary)**
           
           I've made sure to cover the entire space, so 81 initial candidate locations with theta=0 and another 49 positions with theta=pi/4. I can check to see if that strategy results in generating 50 positions, and if so, I can be confident it will produce a successful outcome.
           
           **In summary, my approach is comprehensive and should be able to deliver 50 stable and collision-free placements for Object 6.**

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 5**
           
           Okay, I need to figure out where I can place this new object, ID 5, on Surface 0, making sure I get 50 stable placements.  The catch is, I have to treat the existing objects, ID 4 and ID 6, as immovable obstacles.
           
           **The Setup:**
           
           *   Surface 0 is a square space, centered at (0, 0) and extends from -0.135 to +0.135 in both the x and y directions.
           *   Object 4 is a square with its center at (-0.08, -0.08) and has a size of approximately 0.094.
           *   Object 6 is another square, centered at (-0.08, 0.02) with a size of about 0.096.
           *   Object 5, the new object, is also square, with a size of approximately 0.082.
           
           **The Plan:**
           
           1.  I'll start by calculating the valid placement area for Object 5, considering it can be placed in two orientations:
               *   **0 degrees (parallel to the surface):** Simplest case.
               *   **45 degrees (pi/4 radians):**  This makes the shape a rotated square.
           
           2.  For each potential placement, I'll calculate the *axis-aligned bounding box* (AABB) of Object 5, which is the smallest rectangle that completely encloses the object.
           
           3.  I have to check for collisions.  A placement is valid only if it *doesn't* collide with the AABB of Object 4 *or* the AABB of Object 6. I am using `AABB overlap` as a method for collision detection.
           
           4.  I need to generate a list of 50 different, collision-free placements.
           
           **The Math:**
           
           *   The valid placement area is determined by the size of Object 5 and the dimensions of Surface 0.
           *   I calculated the AABB's for each object.
           *   Then, I devised a grid-based sampling for the object's placements, ensuring to avoid the obstacles during the process by making sure the newly generated AABB's do not overlap with either Object 4 or 6.
           
           **The Logic in code, as an expert.**
           
           I'll be using a robust algorithm to handle this task. First, I set up the environment with the object properties such as height, width, the size of surface 0 and the established objects' height, width, and centers. Then, I would generate the necessary bounding boxes and calculate if the AABB overlaps. From this information, I would have a reliable method to find 50 placements for Object 5.
           
           **Collision Check**
           
           I have a straightforward approach to determine if there's an overlap between the two AABBs: I check if their ranges overlap for both x and y.
           
           **In summary, I have a clear plan and the necessary math to find those stable, non-colliding positions for the new object.**

           1.  **Define Placement Space:** I'll determine the valid ranges for Object 7's center coordinates on Surface 0, considering both axis-aligned (`theta = 0.0`) and rotated (`theta = pi/4`) orientations. This involves accounting for Object 7's own dimensions.
           2.  **Generate Candidate Placements:** I'll create a grid of potential (x, y) coordinates within the valid ranges, considering a step size that gives me enough placements.
           3.  **Collision Detection:** For each candidate placement:
               *   Calculate Object 7's AABB.
               *   Check for collisions with the AABBs of Objects 4, 6, and 5.
               *   If no collisions, the placement is valid.
           4.  **Prioritize Unoccupied Regions:**  I'll focus on exploring areas less likely to have collisions (the right side and bottom/top-right). This is based on the known locations of the existing objects.
           
           **The Details:**
           
           Object 7's Dimensions: The object itself is nearly a square. Its dimensions are 0.09825054177098427 x 0.09825054177098425. This makes AABB calculations relatively straightforward.

Model:     **Strategic Placement of Object 7: A Detailed Plan**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for Object 7 on Surface 0, taking into account the existing fixed obstacles: Objects 4, 6, and 5. This is a standard spatial arrangement problem, but the specific geometric constraints require careful consideration.
           
           **The Lay of the Land:**
           
           *   **Surface 0:**  A square area defined by coordinates `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           *   **Existing Objects:** Their positions and extents are critical. I've calculated their Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) to efficiently check for collisions.
               *   **Object 4:** Located in the bottom-left.
               *   **Object 6:** Positioned in the middle-left.
               *   **Object 5:** Occupying the top-left region.
