(Thoughts: **Robot Base Positioning Strategy for Line-of-Sight & Obstacle Avoidance**
           
           My primary goal is to identify three viable base positions for the robot, ensuring line-of-sight to the target point while navigating around fixed obstacles within the environment. I'm operating under the constraint that the robot's base must be no further than `max_range = 2` from the target, with the orientation automatically adjusted to face the target. The robot's x and y coordinates are also confined to the range `[-2.5, 2.5]`.
           
           I've carefully examined the provided list of fixed obstacles, which include the arena's boundary walls and a series of smaller rectangular obstacles. A particularly crucial element is the vertical wall at x=0, which I recognize as a significant potential occluder. My strategy hinges on effectively avoiding this central obstacle to maintain a clear line of sight.
           
           To accomplish this, I've adopted a multi-faceted approach. First, I generate candidate positions around the target point using a combination of polar coordinates (varying both the radial distance within `max_range` and the angle) and a grid/sample-based approach. I prioritize candidate positions that are likely to have line-of-sight to the target, considering the x=0 wall.
           
           A critical aspect of my methodology is the implementation of a dedicated line-of-sight check for the x=0 wall. This involves determining whether a candidate position and the target point are on opposite sides of the wall. If they are, and the line segment connecting them intersects the wall, I deem that candidate position occluded and avoid it. This heuristic enhances the algorithm's ability to efficiently identify line-of-sight candidates. I will be given feedback on my selections, and can use this to adapt further. The instruction mentions previous positions will be provided for future turns. For this current request, the set of *fixed* obstacles I have already been provided with will be the primary drivers.
           
           Throughout this process, I continually verify candidate positions against the environment boundaries and fixed obstacle AABBs using a point-in-rectangle check, ensuring that the chosen base positions are both valid and free from collisions. The overall system is built to provide diverse solutions to ensure line-of-sight is maintained while ensuring fixed obstacles are successfully navigated.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing Line-of-Sight and Obstacle Interactions**
           
           I've been wrestling with a "no line of sight to target" issue, and it's clear the central vertical wall (Obstacle 5) at x=0 is the main culprit.  I've double-checked my line-of-sight check logic and refined it for greater accuracy.  The key problem appears to be that the proposed positions were on the wrong side of the x=0 wall from the target (1.989, 2.116).
           
           Now, the target itself (1.989, 2.116) is *inside* a fixed obstacle (Obstacle 20: (1.94, 2.067), (2.039, 2.165)), which raises a challenge. Typically, this would mean "no solution," because it implies the target is *within* an obstacle, but I need to "never give up."  I've made the key decision to interpret the target's placement *inside* an obstacle as meaning *that* obstacle doesn't block LOS *to itself*.  This is crucial: line of sight *from* outside is still blocked.
           
           My approach:
           *   I’ll generate positions, ensuring the robot's x-coordinate is greater than 0, to be on the target's side.
           *   I'll make a more careful line-of-sight function that performs a segment-AABB intersection check.
           *   The LOS check will *exclude* any obstacles that contain the target point itself (Obs 20, and Obs 7, which also has the point within its bounds) for the purposes of checking line-of-sight, but collision with them is still problematic!
           
           Let’s go through the steps:
           
           1.  **I have a refined segment-AABB intersection test:** to accurately determine when a line-of-sight segment crosses an obstacle. This function covers these cases: collision, target-inside, and a valid intersection.
           2.  **Valid base positions** must be within the bounds of the "playable" area `((-2.5, -2.5), (2.5, 2.5))` and be at most `2` distance units away from the target, and *not* be inside any of the fixed obstacles.
           3.  **To determine line-of-sight:** If the line segment intersects *any* fixed obstacle *except* Obstacle 7 or 20, then the proposed location is no good.
           
           I've tested the strategy. Here are three viable positions:
           1.  `(1.0, 1.6)`
           2.  `(0.5, 1.0)`
           3.  `(2.0, 0.5)`
           
           I’m confident these positions are safe and satisfy the given problem. My algorithm for intersection detection is very robust, and the interpretation to solve the "never give up" problem seems sound.
