User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Here's my approach to generating 25 robot base positions for a given target:**
           
           My goal is to find 25 (x, y) coordinates for the robot base that meet these criteria:
           
           1.  **Within Range:** Each position must be within a maximum distance of 4 units from the target point.
           2.  **Scene Limits:**  The (x, y) coordinates must fall within the scene's boundaries: x from -2.5 to 2.5 and y from -2.5 to 2.5. I'll use a small buffer within these limits: (-2.45 <= x <= 2.45 and -2.45 <= y <= 2.45)
           3.  **Obstacle Avoidance:** I must avoid collision with any fixed obstacles present in the scene. I will use the set of fixed obstacles listed in the problem description for my obstacle checks. The main obstacles are the walls, which I will not let the robot base get too close to, and several internal obstacles, which I will prevent the robot from colliding with.
           4.  **Diversity:** The positions should be spread out around the target to allow for different viewpoints and angles.
           
           The robot's orientation is automatically set to face the target, so I only need to determine good (x, y) positions.
           
           Since I am given the target point as well as all of the obstacles in the scene, and I can check if an (x,y) point is colliding with a specific obstacle, I will use these tools to generate a list of 25 (x, y) positions for the robot.
           
           My overall strategy is as follows:
           
           1.  **Parse the Target:** First, I'll take the provided `target_point`.
           2.  **Define Search Space:** I'll establish a search space based on the target point and the max\_range (4 units). I know that it should be contained within my global (x, y) limits, as defined above.
           3.  **Candidate Generation:** I'll use a combination of methods to create candidate positions:
               *   **Circular Sampling:** I'll generate points on circles centered around the target with different radii, covering distances up to the max\_range. I'll use a range of angles to cover a full 360 degrees around the target point. This ensures a broad range of viewpoints.
               *   **Filtering:** I'll filter the candidate positions based on the scene limits. Then, I'll remove any positions that collide with any of the fixed obstacles.
           4.  **Line-of-Sight consideration:** In general, the feedback mechanism will tell me if a line of sight is obstructed, and I will be able to refine my strategy based on the feedback.
           
           **Here's the Critical Consideration for the given target:**
           
           The provided target is located at the point: (-0.021, -0.050).
           The central wall (obstacle 5) is defined by the AABB: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)).
           
           The fact that the target is *within* this wall's boundaries is extremely important! It tells me that the robot shouldn't *also* be within the central wall.  Therefore I will ensure that any position I try is *not* inside the central wall. As long as I make that my priority, it should allow for sufficient positions.
           
           **Therefore, my objective is to efficiently generate 25 (x, y) positions and make sure that it's diverse while also avoiding the internal obstacles and ensuring the robot can 'see' the target point.**
           
           I'll proceed to implement the algorithm and generate the 25 required positions.
