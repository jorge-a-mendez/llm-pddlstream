           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning for Placement**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0.  I know the surface's dimensions, and the object is almost a square with dimensions of roughly 0.0775.  My goal is to find valid `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)` values for these 50 placements.  I'll set `surf_idx` to 0 (since it's surface 0) and, for simplicity, will use `theta = 0` (horizontal placement) for all of them, since the object's dimensions are almost identical, `theta = pi/2` will be very similar.
           
           The main challenge is calculating the valid range for `x` and `y`.  I know the surface's AABB: (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  The object's half-extents are about 0.03878, so to keep the object *completely* inside the surface, the center's `x` and `y` coordinates have to be within a smaller AABB.  I've done the math: the valid `x` range is roughly -0.0962 to 0.0962, and the `y` range is roughly the same, -0.0962 to 0.0962.
           
           My strategy is to generate a grid of points within this valid region.  I decided to use 5 different `x` values and 10 different `y` values (for a total of 50). This should provide a good spread.  I calculated the correct step sizes for both `x` and `y` to ensure that I cover the valid range and have the correct total number of points in the output. I am generating `x` values between -0.0962 and 0.0962 and I am spacing them equally. Similarly I will generate 10 equally spaced y values between -0.0962 and 0.0962.
           
           Finally, since there are no previous object placements and therefore no collisions, I will iterate through all coordinate values and report the placements to the caller. Each placement will be represented as `(0, 0, x, y)` where x and y are the coordinates I calculated.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object ID 4**
           
           Alright, I've got a new task: place object ID 4, which is approximately 8cm in size, stably on surface 0 without colliding with the already-placed object ID 5. I've already calculated the valid area on surface 0 for object ID 4, limiting its center to a 19cm by 19cm area centered on the surface. Object 5 is located in the bottom left, specifically at the corner.
           
           To begin, I need to focus on collision avoidance. Based on the position of object 5, I've determined that object 4 must be positioned to the right or above it to avoid any overlap. I've calculated the minimum x and y coordinates for object 4 that will guarantee no collision. Using those calculations, and keeping in mind that object ID 4 can only have a theta of 0, I'll generate a grid of 50 potential positions that satisfy these conditions. To generate the placements, I'll create a grid that will be entirely on the right of object ID 5. These positions guarantee object ID 4 will not collide with object ID 5. I will then test these positions and generate a comprehensive result.

(Thoughts: **My Planning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I need to figure out where to place object ID 6 on surface 0, ensuring it doesn't collide with the already-placed objects, ID 5 and ID 4, and that I get 50 stable placements. I'll make several key considerations:
           
           1.  **Surface Boundaries and Object Dimensions:** First, I'll calculate the valid ranges for object 6 within surface 0, taking into account its dimensions and the surface's size.  I'll represent the object with an AABB for now, assuming theta = 0, which is reasonable given the nearly square dimensions. The surface dimensions are `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`, and object 6 has sizes `(size_x=0.09860053759784518, size_y=0.09860053759784515)`. Therefore, I compute `x_6 in [-0.08569973120107741, 0.08569973120107741]` and `y_6 in [-0.08569973120107742, 0.08569973120107742]`.
           
           2.  **Obstacle Detection - Object 5:** Next, I'll analyze the position of object ID 5. Object 5 is located at  `(-0.09621598673970223, -0.09621598673970221)`. Based on the object sizes, the AABB for object 5 is `x in [-0.135, -0.05743197347940446]` and `y in [-0.135, -0.05743197347940442]`.
           
           3.  **Obstacle Detection - Object 4:** Object ID 4's location `(-0.01684187940081618, -0.09440990592141173)` is next. Its AABB is `x in [-0.05743197347940446, 0.0237482146777721]` and `y in [-0.135, -0.05381981184282346]`.
           
           4.  **Combining Occupied Spaces:** I'll combine the occupied space of objects 4 and 5 to create a unified obstacle region. Because the x-ranges of object 4 and 5 AABBs adjoin perfectly at x = -0.0574, it makes it easier. The combined range in x is  `[-0.135, 0.0237482146777721]`.  The y ranges are nearly the same. So, the combined obstacle region is `x_occupied = [-0.135, 0.0237482146777721]`, `y_occupied = [-0.135, -0.05381981184282346]`.
           
           5.  **Finding Clear Space:** Finally, to avoid collisions, I'll place object 6 *above* the combined AABB. So, I will set y\_min to be slightly above the combined region.  That calculation is `y_6_new_min = -0.0538 + 0.0493 = -0.0045`. This strategy will ensure that the lowest part of object 6's AABB is above the highest part of the combined AABB of objects 4 and 5. This is sufficient to prevent collision. Therefore, the x range is `[-0.0856, 0.0856]`, and y is `[-0.0045, 0.0856]`. I'll generate the placement points from these dimensions.
