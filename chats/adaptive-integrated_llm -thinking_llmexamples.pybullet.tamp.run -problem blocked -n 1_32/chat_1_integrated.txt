User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.607, -0.023, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.989, 0.147).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.651, -0.067), (-4.564, 0.02)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning to Satisfy `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially means getting an object (specifically one that's `type(green, v17)`) *on* surface `v18`.  Given the initial state, we know that either `v12` or `v8` could be our "green" object. Since `v8` seems more readily available (it's supported by `#o2`, which is on `v18`), let's go with that. The key now is to move `v8` onto `v18`.
           
           Examining the initial state, we have the helpful hint that `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. This tells me that `#o2` is *a* valid pose on surface `v18`.  The plan will be to pick `v8` up from its current location (`v9`) and place it at `#o2`. To do this, we need a robot action: pick then place. I know the robot is at baseconf `v3` as indicated by `atbconf(v3)`.
           
           The action preconditions have to be checked for `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`. The kinematic facts tell me that the robot `v4` can pick up `v8` from `v9`. I see that the only `move_base` action `move_base v3 v3 #o0` exists; this suggests `v3` is the base configuration throughout all operations. The missing `atbconf` value, I've decided, is implicitly `v3`. That must mean `#o3`, used in all of the kin predicates, is actually also `v3`. This is a useful insight for ensuring all preconditions will be satisfied and for correctly setting up place. `pick` and `place` also have not explicitly mentioned unsafe poses/approaches, so I'll assume that holds, and plan to carry on.
           
           Next, we need the `place` action. The plan is to `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`.  The kin facts suggest `v4` can place `v8` on pose `#o2`.
           
           **The Plan**
           
           1.  **`pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`**
           2.  **`place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`**
           
           The action sequence will complete the goal. To make the plan executable, I need to provide a continuous value for `#o2`.  Since `pose(v8, #o2)` is in the initial state, and we know `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`, a valid pose for `v8` must be on top of `v18`.  Let's place `v8` at the center, so x = 4.5, y = -0.3. Since v9 is at z=0.8, the placement `z` can be the surface height, or 0.8. Thus,  `#o2 = (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`.
           
           This seems reasonable, considering the size of the objects and the geometry of the scene. With those continuous values for the pose, this plan should work. No robot moves are needed as the `move_base` action is just moving the robot between `v3`.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a challenging problem. The plan I proposed was shot down because it included actions that aren't allowed. The only valid move is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This seems... useless.
           
           The ultimate aim is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having something green (`?green`) *on* `v18`. From the initial conditions, I know that `?green` could be either `v8` or `v12` since both are of the correct type.
           
           To get either `v8` or `v12` onto `v18`, I need the robot to perform a pick-and-place operation. Specifically, for `v8` to be on `v18`, it needs to be *supported* by `#o2` and at that *pose*. Currently, I know `v8` is *supported* by `#o2`, but it's at a different *pose*.  To get `v8` to the right location, I'd need to pick it up from its current pose and put it down at `#o2`.
           
           The same reasoning applies to `v12`. It’s already *supported* correctly, but needs to be *atpose* `#o2`. I’d have to move it.
           
           Now, here's the kicker: the only action I *can* use is the movement of the robot's base. This action does absolutely nothing to change the positions of objects. It has no effect on `atpose`, `atgrasp`, `on`, `cleaned`, or `cooked` predicates.  Since *atpose* has to be changed in order to make the goals true, but the allowed action does not change any of these predicates, it means the goal is unattainable.  The `pick` and `place` actions, which are required, are simply not available to me. It's a fundamental conflict. I'm stuck.
