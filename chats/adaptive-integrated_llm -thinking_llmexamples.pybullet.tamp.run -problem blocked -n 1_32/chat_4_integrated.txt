           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:

           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.607, -0.023, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.989, 0.147).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).

           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).

           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.651, -0.067), (-4.564, 0.02)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Path to New Axiom**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object, which we'll call *green*, be *on* a specific pose, `v18`, and have the *type* of green be a particular type, `v17`.  I see that the objects with the right type are `v12` and `v8`, so either `on(v12, v18)` or `on(v8, v18)` will work. Let's go with the *v8* option.
           
           To achieve `on(v8, v18)`, I need to find a way to make sure `v8` is both *supported* on pose `v18` and *at* that specific pose. Luckily, I already know that `v8` is *supported* by `v18`, and I also know where `v8` is now, that will be my starting point. The actions required are *pick* then *place*, and a *move_base* action to the poses the robot arm needs to be in.
           
           The current situation is:
           `v8` is *at* the pose `v9` on surface `v11`. To move the robot to it, I'll need to use the `move_base` action. Then, to place `v8` on `v18`, the current arm pose (`v3`) must be *move_base* to `v1`.
           
           So here's the planned sequence:
           
           1.  **Move to `v9`**  The robot arm needs to go there first. This means moving the base to where the robot can pick `v8`.
           2.  **Pick `v8` from `v9`** Get `v8` from the surface `v11`.
           3.  **Move to place `v8`**  The robot arm needs to go to the location needed to place `v8` to target pose.
           4.  **Place `v8` on `v18`** Put `v8` onto the pose.
           
           Now, to make it all work, let's break down each of these steps.
           
           **Step 1:  Move base action** I need to move the robot base from `v3` to `v1`. To do this the `move_base` is needed.
           
           **Step 2:  Picking up `v8`**  I have a `pick` action that I can call to do this. I need the robot arm, `v4`, object `v8`, the surface `v9`, and some grasping and trajectory parameters. The preconditions require `v8` to be at `v9`, which is currently true. Also, the robot's arm needs to be empty, which is also the case. The `kin` predicate is also true, and I'll have to assume that any required `NegatedAtom` conditions related to safety are met because they're not explicitly negated in the initial state. So this looks good.
           
           **Step 3: Move Base to Place Action** Again, a `move_base` needed to be moved.
           
           **Step 4:  Placing `v8`** I can use the `place` action for this. I need the robot arm, the object `v8`, a destination pose, a grasping configuration, a trajectory configuration, and a target surface, the place where the thing goes, `v18`. Again, safety concerns I'll assume are satisfied for now. I'll need a final `move_base` action to get the base to this position so that the `place` action can be used to set `v8` on top of `v18`.
           
           **Continuous Parameters**
           
           I need to nail down the specific location for `v8` on `v18`. The system gives me the AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) for `v8`, and I see that a placement that keeps `v8` centered within `v18`'s bounds makes the most sense. Calculating the center of `v18`, I pick a pose for the *bottom* of `v8` that is (4.5, -0.3, 0.8), with a zero rotation (0.0).  I have confirmed this placement won't violate any rules and is safe from all the known conditions.
           
           **Checking the final actions**
           
           I'm confident that the sequence, with the appropriate parameters, will do the trick: I can find the parameters I need, and the plan is looking correct. The goal axiom seems achievable.
