           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:

           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.607, -0.023, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.989, 0.147).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).

           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`:**
           
           The goal is to get an object (like a plate) onto a table or counter (`v18`).  I've got two candidate plates: `v8` and `v12`.  Since `v8` is already near the target counter (`v11` is part of it, with `v18` being a surface of `v11`) and appears more accessible, I'll go with `v8`.
           
           Currently, `v8` is on a surface at pose `v9`, which is essentially a counter. The `stackable` property confirms I can put `v8` on the `v18` counter.
           
           My plan involves these actions:
           
           1.  **Move the base:** I need to move the robot base from its current configuration (`v3`) to a configuration near where I can pick up `v8` (which is `v9` currently). I'll need to calculate a target base configuration (`#q1`) and a trajectory (`#t3`) for this move, and this movement will cost some `distance`.
           2.  **Pick up `v8`:** I'll use the right arm (`v4`) and a grasp (`#g0`) to pick up `v8` at its current pose (`v9`). This action will require the base to be at the calculated configuration to pick `v8`. The appropriate trajectory for pick motion will be `t1`.
           3.  **Move the base again:** After picking up `v8`, I'll need to move the robot base to a location near the target counter `v18`.  I'll have to calculate a new base configuration (`#q0`) for this and generate trajectory `#o0`.
           4.  **Place `v8`:**  Finally, I'll place `v8` onto the counter `v18` at a pre-calculated pose (`#p0`). I know the grasp (`#g0`), and I also know that there are appropriate trajectories for the placement action.
           
           **Details of the placement pose, #p0:**
           
           I've carefully considered the geometry.  `v8` has a size, and it needs to fit within the boundaries of `v18`.  The current AABB for `v8` is approximately (4.465, 0.265) to (4.535, 0.335), and for `v18` it is (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0).  I've calculated a safe, collision-free pose for placing `v8`. The target pose `#p0` will be (4.5, -0.1, 0.8, 0.0).  This places the object at the central x position of the counter, at a y position within the y range, and at a height suitable for it to rest on the counter.
           
           **Costs and Final Checks:**
           
           The overall cost will include moving the robot's base twice (`move_base`), plus the costs of picking and placing an object. I've estimated that the move costs are the euclidean distance, which is roughly 2.02 and 0.35 respectively, for a total movement cost of 2.37. Pick and place have an assumed cost of 1 each. So, the total cost should be around 4.37. The total plan uses all appropriate actions for object placement.
