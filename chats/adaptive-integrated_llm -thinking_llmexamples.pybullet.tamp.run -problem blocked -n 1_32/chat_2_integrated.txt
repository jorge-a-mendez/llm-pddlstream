           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.607, -0.023, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.989, 0.147).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.651, -0.067), (-4.564, 0.02)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Path to New Axiom**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. The goal is to establish the new axiom `new-axiom@0()`, which means I need to make sure an object is *on* a specific surface and that it has a specific *type*. The target surface, `v18`, appears to be a table or counter based on its AABB. My strategy is to focus on placing an object onto this surface that satisfies the type requirement.
           
           I've looked at the available objects and see that `v8` is initially `on` another surface, `v11`.  Crucially, `v8` is already of the correct `type` (`v17`). This makes `v8` the best candidate because I only need to address its position. My plan is to *pick* up `v8` and *place* it directly onto `v18`.
           
           Here’s the step-by-step approach. First, I’ll *move_base* to a location, presumably to be near v8, then I will *pick* v8 up from its current location using the available *pick* action. Once I have `v8` in my grasp, I will *place* it onto `v18`. From the given data, I can see that `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is already true, meaning #o2 is a suitable pose. I'll need to calculate continuous values for `#o2` that positions `v8` on the surface `v18`.
           
           To implement this, I’ve considered the AABBs of both `v8` and `v18`. I decided on the following: to place `v8` at the position `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8)` which is near the center of `v18`'s surface and ensure that it is entirely within `v18`. The value `0.8` reflects the height for placement.
           
           After validating all preconditions (like the required robot base poses) and checking that placing `v8` in `v18` does not collide with existing objects, this plan seems optimal. It's a direct route using provided actions, and with my placement for `#o2`, it's safe. Therefore, using this sequence of *move_base*, *pick*, and *place*, I should successfully establish the necessary conditions and satisfy the axiom `new-axiom@0()`.
