           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.607, -0.023, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.989, 0.147).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.651, -0.067), (-4.564, 0.02)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)
           Atom type(v12, v17)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom stackable(v15, v10)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom graspable(v15)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v14)
           Atom type(v8, v17)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom stackable(v8, v18)
           Atom pose(v15, v16)
           Atom stackable(v12, v18)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable with Available Actions**
           
           My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having either `v12` or `v8` on `v18`, with both also satisfying the `type` predicate. I've determined that both `v12` and `v8` meet the `type` requirement, so the critical task is to get one of them on `v18`.
           
           Analyzing the current state, `v12` is on `v14` and `v8` is on `v11`. To change this, I would need to perform `pick` and `place` actions to move either object to `v18`. However, the available action instances are severely limited. The only permitted action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action simply moves the base from `v3` to itself, using trajectory `#o0`. It doesn't modify the spatial configuration of any objects.
           
           Since the allowed action does not support any state-changing operations like `pick` or `place`, the goal is not achievable with the given constraints.
