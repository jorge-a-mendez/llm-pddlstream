(Thoughts: **A Strategy for Achieving `new-axiom@0()` in the `pr2-tamp` Domain**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get an object of a specific type "on" another object.  Specifically, we want to place an object of type `v17` onto `v18`. From the initial state, it's clear that `v12` is the object of type `v17` we're interested in.  So, the objective simplifies to `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           Now, the `on` predicate translates to finding a pose where `v12` is supported by `v18`. A quick look at the facts reveals that `v12` *can* be supported on `v18` at a particular pose, which we'll call `#o2`.  Therefore, we need to manipulate `v12` until it's at pose `#o2`.  Currently, it's at `v13`.
           
           The natural approach is to pick up `v12` from `v13` and place it at `#o2`.  The `pick` and `place` actions are available, but they have preconditions that need to be carefully considered.
           
           The key issue with `pick` is that it requires being at a specific base configuration (`#o3`).  We're currently at `v3`. That means we must use the `move_base` action to reposition the robot. To that end, moving from `v3` to `#o3` is necessary.
           
           With the robot at `#o3`, we can execute the `pick` action.  We must then position the hand such that we are grasping `v12`.
           
           Finally, we'll place the object on `v18`.
           
           So, the plan unfolds as follows:
           1.  Move the base from `v3` to `#o3`.
           2.  Pick up `v12` from `v13` with the robot's gripper, picking up the object.
           3.  Place `v12` at position `#o2`.
           
           Once this plan has been executed, the postconditions will satisfy `new-axiom@0()` given that `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` is true. All the plan's preconditions, postconditions, and effects were verified. We should be good to go.
