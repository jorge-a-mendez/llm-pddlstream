           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27. The object is also square, with dimensions 0.0877 x 0.0877. This means the object is significantly smaller than the surface, allowing for many possible placements.
           
           I will attempt to place the object on surface 0. Since the object is square, its orientation doesn't change its bounding box, so I can keep the angle at 0 for simplicity in many cases. I will try to cover a range of x and y coordinates within the surface's bounds, ensuring the object is fully contained.
           
           The surface ranges from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           The object has a half-size of approximately 0.0877 / 2 = 0.04385.
           To keep the object on the surface, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.04385 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.04385
           -0.09115 <= x <= 0.09115
           
           -0.09115 <= y <= 0.09115
           
           I will generate placements by varying x and y within these bounds, and will include a few rotated placements as well.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene is the same as before, with a single square surface (0.27 x 0.27) centered at the origin.
           Now I need to place a new object, ID 6, which is also square with dimensions 0.0828 x 0.0828.
           I know that object 5 (0.0877 x 0.0877) was successfully placed at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). This means object 5 is currently at the center of surface 0.
           I must avoid collision between object 6 and object 5.
           
           The half-size of object 6 is approximately 0.0828 / 2 = 0.0414.
           The half-size of object 5 is approximately 0.0877 / 2 = 0.04385.
           
           The bounding box for object 5 is from -0.04385 to 0.04385 in both x and y.
           This means I need to place object 6 such that its bounding box does not overlap with this region.
           
           For object 6 to be on the surface, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.0414 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.0414
           -0.0936 <= x <= 0.0936
           
           -0.0936 <= y <= 0.0936
           
           To avoid collision with object 5 (centered at 0,0 with half-width 0.04385), the x and y coordinates of object 6's center must satisfy:
           abs(x) >= 0.04385 + 0.0414 = 0.08525
           abs(y) >= 0.04385 + 0.0414 = 0.08525
           
           So, I should look for placements where the absolute x and y coordinates are greater than or equal to 0.08525, but also within the surface bounds (-0.0936 to 0.0936).
           This means I have a narrow band near the edges of the surface.
           
           For example, possible x values could be around 0.085 to 0.093.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene is the same square surface at the origin.
           I need to place object 4, which is square with dimensions 0.0843 x 0.0843.
           I have two existing objects:
           - Object 5 (0.0877 x 0.0877) is at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Its bounding box is from -0.04385 to 0.04385 in x and y.
           - Object 6 (0.0828 x 0.0828) is at (0, 0.0, 0.088, 0.088). Its bounding box is from (0.088 - 0.0414) to (0.088 + 0.0414) in x and y, which is (0.0466, 0.1294) in x and (0.0466, 0.1294) in y.
           
           The half-size of object 4 is approximately 0.0843 / 2 = 0.04215.
           For object 4 to be on the surface, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.04215 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.04215
           -0.09285 <= x <= 0.09285
           
           -0.09285 <= y <= 0.09285
           
           Now I need to avoid collision with objects 5 and 6.
           
           Collision with object 5 (center 0,0, half-size 0.04385):
           abs(x) >= 0.04385 + 0.04215 = 0.086
           abs(y) >= 0.04385 + 0.04215 = 0.086
           
           Collision with object 6 (center 0.088, 0.088, half-size 0.0414):
           Let (x4, y4) be the center of object 4, and (x6, y6) be the center of object 6.
           abs(x4 - x6) >= 0.0414 + 0.04215 = 0.08355
           abs(y4 - y6) >= 0.0414 + 0.04215 = 0.08355
           So, abs(x4 - 0.088) >= 0.08355
           And, abs(y4 - 0.088) >= 0.08355
           
           Combining these conditions:
           From obj 5: x must be outside [-0.086, 0.086], y must be outside [-0.086, 0.086].
           From obj 6:
           x4 - 0.088 >= 0.08355 => x4 >= 0.17155 (outside surface bounds)
           x4 - 0.088 <= -0.08355 => x4 <= 0.00445
           
           y4 - 0.088 >= 0.08355 => y4 >= 0.17155 (outside surface bounds)
           y4 - 0.088 <= -0.08355 => y4 <= 0.00445
           
           So, for x and y, I need to be in the range [-0.09285, 0.09285].
           Also, x must be outside [-0.086, 0.086]. This leaves small bands: [-0.09285, -0.086) and (0.086, 0.09285].
           Also, x must be <= 0.00445.
           And y must be <= 0.00445.
           
           This means my placement will likely be in the negative x, negative y quadrant, or along the negative axes, avoiding object 6 which is in the positive x, positive y quadrant.
           Given x <= 0.00445 and x outside [-0.086, 0.086], possible x values are in [-0.09285, -0.086).
           Given y <= 0.00445 and y outside [-0.086, 0.086], possible y values are in [-0.09285, -0.086).
           
           Let's try to place it in the lower-left corner of the surface.
           For example, x = -0.088, y = -0.088. This satisfies all conditions.
           -0.088 is within [-0.09285, -0.086)
           -0.088 is within [-0.09285, -0.086)

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene is the same square surface at the origin.
           I need to place object 7, which is square with dimensions 0.0769 x 0.0769.
           I have three existing objects:
           - Object 5 (0.0877 x 0.0877) is at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Bounding box: x in [-0.04385, 0.04385], y in [-0.04385, 0.04385].
           - Object 6 (0.0828 x 0.0828) is at (0, 0.0, 0.088, 0.088). Bounding box: x in [0.0466, 0.1294], y in [0.0466, 0.1294].
           - Object 4 (0.0843 x 0.0843) is at (0, 0.0, -0.088, -0.088). Bounding box: x in [-0.12925, -0.04675], y in [-0.12925, -0.04675].
           
           The half-size of object 7 is approximately 0.0769 / 2 = 0.03845.
           For object 7 to be on the surface, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.03845 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.03845
           -0.09655 <= x <= 0.09655
           
           -0.09655 <= y <= 0.09655
           
           Now I need to avoid collision with objects 5, 6, and 4.
           
           Collision with object 5 (center 0,0, half-size 0.04385):
           abs(x) >= 0.04385 + 0.03845 = 0.0823
           abs(y) >= 0.04385 + 0.03845 = 0.0823
           
           Collision with object 6 (center 0.088, 0.088, half-size 0.0414):
           abs(x - 0.088) >= 0.0414 + 0.03845 = 0.07985
           abs(y - 0.088) >= 0.0414 + 0.03845 = 0.07985
           So, x - 0.088 >= 0.07985 => x >= 0.16785 (outside surface) or x - 0.088 <= -0.07985 => x <= 0.00815
           And y <= 0.00815
           
           Collision with object 4 (center -0.088, -0.088, half-size 0.04215):
           abs(x - (-0.088)) >= 0.04215 + 0.03845 = 0.0806
           abs(y - (-0.088)) >= 0.04215 + 0.03845 = 0.0806
           So, x + 0.088 >= 0.0806 => x >= -0.0074
           Or x + 0.088 <= -0.0806 => x <= -0.1686 (outside surface)
           And y >= -0.0074
           
           Let's combine these:
           Surface bounds: x in [-0.09655, 0.09655], y in [-0.09655, 0.09655].
           From obj 5: x outside [-0.0823, 0.0823], y outside [-0.0823, 0.0823].
           From obj 6: x <= 0.00815, y <= 0.00815.
           From obj 4: x >= -0.0074, y >= -0.0074.
           
           Combining the constraints for x:
           x in [-0.09655, 0.09655]
           x not in [-0.0823, 0.0823]
           x <= 0.00815
           x >= -0.0074
           
           This means x must be in [-0.0074, 0.00815].
           However, x also must be outside [-0.0823, 0.0823].
           These two conditions conflict: if x is in [-0.0074, 0.00815], it *is* within [-0.0823, 0.0823]. This means there are no valid x values.
           
           Let me re-check my collision logic.
           The condition "abs(x) >= threshold" means x is either <= -threshold OR x is >= threshold.
           So, from obj 5: x in [-0.09655, -0.0823] U [0.0823, 0.09655]. Same for y.
           
           Now combine with obj 6: x <= 0.00815, y <= 0.00815.
           This rules out [0.0823, 0.09655]. So x must be in [-0.09655, -0.0823]. Same for y.
           
           Now combine with obj 4: x >= -0.0074, y >= -0.0074.
           This rules out [-0.09655, -0.0823].
           
           This indicates that there might be no space for object 7. Let me review the successful placements.
           Object 5: (0,0,0) - full center occupied.
           Object 6: (0,0.088, 0.088) - upper right corner occupied.
           Object 4: (0,-0.088, -0.088) - lower left corner occupied.
           
           The remaining corners are (0.088, -0.088) and (-0.088, 0.088). Let's check these.
           Consider placing object 7 at (0.088, -0.088).
           
           Candidate center (x7, y7) = (0.088, -0.088).
           This is within surface bounds [-0.09655, 0.09655].
           
           Check collision with obj 5 (center 0,0, half-size 0.04385):
           abs(0.088) = 0.088, which is >= 0.0823. (OK)
           abs(-0.088) = 0.088, which is >= 0.0823. (OK)
           No collision with obj 5.
           
           Check collision with obj 6 (center 0.088, 0.088, half-size 0.0414):
           abs(x7 - x6) = abs(0.088 - 0.088) = 0.0. This is NOT >= 0.07985. So it COLLIDES.
           My original logic was: x <= 0.00815. For x7 = 0.088, this is false.
           
           This means my previous reasoning about the conflict was correct, and my understanding of the space available is limited.
           The issue is with the interaction of multiple objects and their combined no-go zones.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the collision zones visually:
           Obj 5 is a square from -0.04385 to 0.04385.
           Obj 6 is a square from (0.0466, 0.0466) to (0.1294, 0.1294).
           Obj 4 is a square from (-0.12925, -0.12925) to (-0.04675, -0.04675).
           
           The object 7 half-size is 0.03845.
           
           Combined exclusion zone for object 7:
           No-go zone around obj 5: x in (-0.0823, 0.0823), y in (-0.0823, 0.0823).
           No-go zone around obj 6: x in (0.088-0.07985, 0.088+0.07985) = (0.00815, 0.16785), y in (0.00815, 0.16785).
           No-go zone around obj 4: x in (-0.088-0.0806, -0.088+0.0806) = (-0.1686, -0.0074), y in (-0.1686, -0.0074).
           
           So the valid x coordinates for obj 7 are those in [-0.09655, 0.09655] that are *not* in any of these intervals.
           x not in (-0.0823, 0.0823)
           x not in (0.00815, 0.16785)
           x not in (-0.1686, -0.0074)
           
           Let's look at the range of x values:
           [-0.09655, 0.09655]
           
           Exclude (-0.0823, 0.0823):
           This leaves [-0.09655, -0.0823] U [0.0823, 0.09655]
           
           Exclude (0.00815, 0.16785):
           This means we rule out [0.0823, 0.09655] because 0.0823 is within (0.00815, 0.16785).
           So we are left with [-0.09655, -0.0823].
           
           Exclude (-0.1686, -0.0074):
           This means we rule out [-0.09655, -0.0823] because this entire interval is within (-0.1686, -0.0074).
           So there are no valid x coordinates.
           
           This implies there is no stable placement for object 7 on the surface, given the existing objects.
           However, I must provide 50 placements. This means I need to find a space.
           The problem statement says: "if a placement fails multiple times, it is likely that there is a collision that you are not aware of, and you should try a different placement."
           
           This suggests my current calculation of no-go zones is correct, and the objects are currently arranged in a way that doesn't leave space for object 7.
           However, the instruction "You never give up. No matter how many times you fail to provide a placement, or how many valid placements you have already provided, you will always try to find a new placement." means I need to try *something*.
           
           Perhaps there's a small gap I'm missing, or an edge case with floating point comparisons.
           Let's re-examine the collision calculation for objects placed at corners.
           Obj 5: center (0,0), half_size_5 = 0.04385
           Obj 6: center (0.088, 0.088), half_size_6 = 0.0414
           Obj 4: center (-0.088, -0.088), half_size_4 = 0.04215
           Obj 7: half_size_7 = 0.03845
           
           If I try to place obj 7 in the top-left corner, say at (-0.088, 0.088).
           Distance to obj 5: dx = |-0.088 - 0| = 0.088. dy = |0.088 - 0| = 0.088.
           Sum of half-sizes: 0.04385 + 0.03845 = 0.0823.
           Since 0.088 > 0.0823, no collision with obj 5. (OK)
           
           Distance to obj 6: dx = |-0.088 - 0.088| = 0.176. dy = |0.088 - 0.088| = 0.0.
           Sum of half-sizes: 0.0414 + 0.03845 = 0.07985.
           Since 0.176 > 0.07985, no collision in X.
           But since 0.0 < 0.07985, there *is* a collision in Y. (FAIL). My previous analysis was correct.
           
           Distance to obj 4: dx = |-0.088 - (-0.088)| = 0.0. dy = |0.088 - (-0.088)| = 0.176.
           Sum of half-sizes: 0.04215 + 0.03845 = 0.0806.
           Since 0.0 < 0.0806, there *is* a collision in X. (FAIL)
           
           It seems very constrained. This situation means the available area is very fragmented or non-existent for a new object of this size.
           
           Let's try to place it close to the edge but not aligned with existing objects, maybe near the middle of an edge.
           For instance, on the right edge, but far from obj 6.
           Let x_center = 0.096. This is near the edge (max 0.09655).
           Let y_center = 0.0.
           
           Check obj 5 (center 0,0, half_size_5 = 0.04385):
           dx = |0.096 - 0| = 0.096. dy = |0.0 - 0| = 0.0.
           sum_half = 0.04385 + 0.03845 = 0.0823.
           Collision in Y (0.0 < 0.0823). This fails.
           
           This confirms that the center of object 7 cannot be within (-0.0823, 0.0823) for both x and y.
           
           So the object has to be "outside" of the central square.
           This means its center (x,y) must satisfy:
           (abs(x) >= 0.0823) OR (abs(y) >= 0.0823).
           
           Let's try to place it in one of the remaining "quadrants" that are not currently occupied.
           The center (0,0) is occupied (obj 5).
           The (+x, +y) quadrant is occupied (obj 6 is at (0.088, 0.088)).
           The (-x, -y) quadrant is occupied (obj 4 is at (-0.088, -0.088)).
           
           This leaves the (+x, -y) quadrant and the (-x, +y) quadrant.
           
           Consider the (+x, -y) quadrant.
           Let's target a center (x, y) = (0.088, -0.088) (this was the target earlier but failed with obj6).
           
           Recalculate.
           Obj 7 center (0.088, -0.088).
           Surface check:
           0.088 is within [-0.09655, 0.09655]. OK.
           -0.088 is within [-0.09655, 0.09655]. OK.
           
           Collision with obj 5 (center 0,0, half_size_5 = 0.04385):
           abs(0.088) >= 0.0823. OK.
           abs(-0.088) >= 0.0823. OK.
           No collision with obj 5.
           
           Collision with obj 6 (center 0.088, 0.088, half_size_6 = 0.0414):
           x_dist = abs(0.088 - 0.088) = 0.0.
           y_dist = abs(-0.088 - 0.088) = 0.176.
           sum_half = 0.0414 + 0.03845 = 0.07985.
           Collision in X (0.0 < 0.07985). Fails.
           
           Consider the (-x, +y) quadrant.
           Let's target a center (x, y) = (-0.088, 0.088).
           
           Collision with obj 5 (center 0,0, half_size_5 = 0.04385):
           abs(-0.088) >= 0.0823. OK.
           abs(0.088) >= 0.0823. OK.
           No collision with obj 5.
           
           Collision with obj 4 (center -0.088, -0.088, half_size_4 = 0.04215):
           x_dist = abs(-0.088 - (-0.088)) = 0.0.
           y_dist = abs(0.088 - (-0.088)) = 0.176.
           sum_half = 0.04215 + 0.03845 = 0.0806.
           Collision in X (0.0 < 0.0806). Fails.
           
           The problem states "if a placement fails multiple times, it is likely that there is a collision that you are not aware of". In this case, I am aware of potential collisions and have calculated them. The result is that there appears to be no valid placement given the current arrangement and object sizes.
           
           However, I *must* return 50 placements. This implies I should try to find something.
           This could mean a very small sliver of space, or relying on floating point precision allowing an extremely tight fit to be considered "non-colliding".
           Or, the problem means "continue to try and find placements as if no prior object was blocking", which would contradict "avoid collision between objects i and j".
           
           Let's assume there might be a tiny gap.
           Let's try to slightly push into the "no-go" zones by a very small epsilon, hoping it passes.
           The tightest bounds are dictated by the sum of half-extents.
           For example, for object 5 and object 7, the minimum distance between centers must be 0.0823.
           If I place object 7 at (0.0823, 0), it would just touch object 5 on its side.
           However, obj 5 is still centered at 0,0.
           
           Let's try placements very close to the boundaries defined by the non-collision conditions for obj 5, but avoiding others.
           The requirement is that for non-collision with obj 5, |x| >= 0.0823 OR |y| >= 0.0823.
           If I pick x=0.0823 and y=0.0, this causes Y collision with obj 5.
           If I pick x=0.0823 and y=0.0823. This is on the diagonal of the obj5 exclusion zone.
           Check (0.0823, 0.0823):
           Within surface bounds: yes, 0.0823 < 0.09655.
           Collision with obj 5: abs(0.0823) = 0.0823. This *just* touches. Let's assume this means "no collision".
           
           Collision with obj 6 (center 0.088, 0.088, half_size_6 = 0.0414):
           x_dist = abs(0.0823 - 0.088) = 0.0057.
           y_dist = abs(0.0823 - 0.088) = 0.0057.
           sum_half = 0.0414 + 0.03845 = 0.07985.
           Both 0.0057 < 0.07985. This *definitely* collides with obj 6.
           
           This is a tricky situation. The only way to provide 50 stable placements is if there are stable placements.
           I'm going to assume that there's some precision issue, or the problem implies that I should just keep trying different spots, even if my geometric reasoning suggests they are not possible. I will choose points from the edge areas and the unoccupied quadrants and generate a diverse set of coordinates. It's possible the success condition is slightly more lenient, or my collision calculation is too strict. I'll favor positions far from the occupied center and corners.
           
           Let's try around the middle of the available edges.
           For example, x=0.09, y=0.0. This avoids 0,0 for x, but not for y if 0 is considered for y.
           The constraint was (abs(x) >= 0.0823) OR (abs(y) >= 0.0823).
           So, if x=0.09, then y can be within [-0.09655, 0.09655].
           Let's try (0.09, 0.0).
           
           Collision with obj 5 (center 0,0, half_size_5 = 0.04385):
           abs(0.09) = 0.09 >= 0.0823. OK.
           abs(0.0) = 0.0 < 0.0823. This means X collision is avoided, but there is still Y overlap with obj5's bounding box center 0. This implies collision.
           
           The non-collision with obj 5 requires that *either* the x-distance *or* the y-distance is sufficient to separate them, *assuming axis-aligned bounding boxes*.
           If center of obj A is (Xa, Ya) and half-extents are (Hx_a, Hy_a)
           If center of obj B is (Xb, Yb) and half-extents are (Hx_b, Hy_b)
           Collision if:
           abs(Xa - Xb) < Hx_a + Hx_b AND abs(Ya - Yb) < Hy_a + Hy_b
           
           My previous calculations were based on this. Let's re-run for a potential point: (0.09, -0.09)
           
           Object 7: (0.09, -0.09), half_size_7 = 0.03845.
           Surface bounds: x in [-0.09655, 0.09655], y in [-0.09655, 0.09655]. (0.09 and -0.09 are OK).
           
           Collision with obj 5 (center 0,0, half_size_5 = 0.04385):
           Hx_5 = 0.04385, Hy_5 = 0.04385
           dx = abs(0.09 - 0) = 0.09. Hx_5 + Hx_7 = 0.04385 + 0.03845 = 0.0823.
           dy = abs(-0.09 - 0) = 0.09. Hy_5 + Hy_7 = 0.04385 + 0.03845 = 0.0823.
           Since 0.09 > 0.0823 for both x and y, NO collision with obj 5. (OK)
           
           Collision with obj 6 (center 0.088, 0.088, half_size_6 = 0.0414):
           Hx_6 = 0.0414, Hy_6 = 0.0414
           dx = abs(0.09 - 0.088) = 0.002. Hx_6 + Hx_7 = 0.0414 + 0.03845 = 0.07985.
           dy = abs(-0.09 - 0.088) = 0.178. Hy_6 + Hy_7 = 0.0414 + 0.03845 = 0.07985.
           Since 0.002 < 0.07985 for x, AND 0.178 > 0.07985 for y. This means it *does* collide in X. (FAIL)
           
           Collision with obj 4 (center -0.088, -0.088, half_size_4 = 0.04215):
           Hx_4 = 0.04215, Hy_4 = 0.04215
           dx = abs(0.09 - (-0.088)) = 0.178. Hx_4 + Hx_7 = 0.04215 + 0.03845 = 0.0806.
           dy = abs(-0.09 - (-0.088)) = 0.002. Hy_4 + Hy_7 = 0.04215 + 0.03845 = 0.0806.
           Since 0.178 > 0.0806 for x, AND 0.002 < 0.0806 for y. This means it *does* collide in Y. (FAIL)
           
           This confirms my earlier detailed breakdown: there seems to be no space for object 7.
           Since I must provide 50 placements, I will generate placements that are within the surface bounds, and *attempt* to be far from the existing objects, but I acknowledge that based on my calculations, they will likely fail. I will try the four corners (minus the occupied ones) and the midpoints of the edges, and slight variations. I have to provide 50, so I will fill the list. The issue seems to be a scene with no available space for the new object.
           
           I will try points in the corners that are not yet occupied, e.g. (+x, -y) and (-x, +y) quadrants, and along the edges. I will also try slightly further out and slightly further in, covering the range I calculated earlier: [-0.09655, 0.09655].
