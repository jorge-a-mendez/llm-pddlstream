(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 4) on a surface (`surf_0`). The object's dimensions are almost square (0.07199... x 0.07199...), and the surface is a square AABB defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  A placement is defined as `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`, where `theta` is the rotation and `(x, y)` is the object's center.  Stability means the object's rotated bounding box remains fully within the surface's AABB.
           
           Since the object is nearly square, the variation in the object's rotated bounding box dimensions (rotated half-extents, or `rhx` and `rhy`) with different rotation angles (`theta`) will be small. The surface's fixed square shape makes it relatively easy to calculate valid placements.
           
           To generate diverse placements, I'll use 10 different rotation angles (`theta`) evenly distributed between 0 and pi. I can then generate 5 positions for each unique theta, for a total of 50.
           
           For each `theta`:
           
           1.  I calculate the rotated half-extents (`rhx`, `rhy`) using the standard rotation matrix and dimensions.
           2.  I then determine the valid range for `x` and `y` center coordinates, based on the `rhx`, `rhy` and the surface AABB.
           3.  I place the object at 5 different (x,y) positions, ensuring that each position is completely within the allowed range. These include a center point and four quadrant points for a good coverage of the accessible area.
           
           This strategy ensures that the generated placements are both stable (within the surface AABB) and diverse (covering different orientations and positions). The near-square shape simplifies the calculations, but by including a sufficient number of different rotation values I ensure that any rotation will fit. The 50 unique positions can now be used for downstream calculations.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 5 (Collision-Free)**
           
           My primary task is to place Object ID 5 on the same surface as Object ID 4 (which is already successfully placed at (0, 0) with no rotation).  A crucial constraint is to avoid any collision between Object 5 and Object 4. I'll need to use the provided object extents and the surface boundaries to do so.
           
           Here's my approach:
           
           1.  **Define Key Properties:** I've identified the extents of both objects. Object 4's AABB is approximately `[-0.036, 0.036] x [-0.036, 0.036]`. Object 5 is almost square, with extents (0.096, 0.096).  I also know Surface 0's bounds: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           2.  **Rotation Considerations:** Object 5's rotation will affect its AABB. I'll calculate `obj5_rot_half_w` and `obj5_rot_half_h` for different `theta` values. Then use the formulas for the rotated AABB.
           
           3.  **Collision Avoidance:** To prevent collisions, Object 5's AABB must *not* overlap Object 4's AABB.  I'll ensure the object's center is sufficiently far away from (0,0) based on rotation.
           
           4.  **Placement Logic:** Given a rotation angle, I'll calculate valid placement zones within the bounds of Surface 0. Object 5 has an extent and can't occupy the same space. I'll pick a non-overlapping region. The goal is that each placement is guaranteed collision-free.
           
           I'm developing a set of 5 placements per rotation angle (theta = 0 to pi), and a total of 50. The center positions are at different points that are guaranteed to stay outside Object 4's AABB.
           For each angle theta:
           - I'll compute the rotated width and height bounds.
           - I'll compute the valid surface center bounds.
           - I'll make a corner choice, at most 5 places within that surface.
           
           The approach involves calculating valid placement zones on the surface, considering the object's rotated bounding box, and ensuring that no generated placements collide with the center point of Object 4.

(Thoughts: **Okay, let's break this down for object ID 6.** I'm tasked with finding 50 stable and collision-free positions for this object on a surface (Surface 0). There are two other objects already placed there, so I need to avoid them.
           
           **First**, I looked at the surface, which is a square. I calculated the valid range for placing the object's center, keeping in mind that the object is also a square and might be rotated. I realized the angle of rotation makes a difference to the object's bounding box size.
           
           **My Approach:**
           *   **Rotation:** I decided to iterate through different orientations (theta values), focusing on angles near 0, pi/2, pi, and 3pi/2 because these keep the rotated bounding box sizes smaller.
           *   **Bounding Boxes and Collision:** I meticulously calculated the bounding boxes of the other objects (ID 4 and ID 5) and the *rotated* bounding box for object 6. Then, I set up a system to *identify which areas would be free from collision* after each object rotation.
           *   **Forbidden regions:** I quickly realized that many angles of rotation (theta values near pi/4) will make this very difficult to do in a space like this, given object 4 (a large central box) is already placed there. I had to focus on a *very* small range of angular rotations. I've deduced that the top-right corner is the *only* free region and will have very specific placement needs for object 6.
           
           **Final Strategy:**
           *   I'll place object 6 at different orientations from my selected "safe" angle groups.
           *   The placement locations are *very* tightly packed within the top-right corner of the surface to ensure no overlaps.
           *   I'll iterate and generate 10 points *along a diagonal line* of the top-right corner to populate my 50 required points.
           
           By doing this, I'll *guarantee* 50 stable and non-colliding placements for object 6.
