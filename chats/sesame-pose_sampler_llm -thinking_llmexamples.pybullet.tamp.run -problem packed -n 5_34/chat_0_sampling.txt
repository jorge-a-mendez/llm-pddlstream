(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 6**
           
           Okay, I've got the task laid out: I need to find 50 stable placements for object 6, a nearly square object with dimensions around 0.092, on a square surface. The surface is centered at (0,0) and extends from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           
           My strategy is to vary the object's orientation (theta) and its position (x, y) on the surface. Since the object is almost square, the effective dimensions of its bounding box won't change drastically with rotation. I'll use a few key angles: 0, pi/6, pi/3, pi/2, and 2pi/3. I'll need to generate a set of x and y coordinates that account for both the object's size and its rotated orientation to fit within the surface.
           
           First, I define the effective width and height of the object based on the theta of rotation and then calculate the boundaries within which the object's center can be placed.  I'm using the `linspace` function to generate a 5x2 grid of (x,y) coordinates within each range, giving me 10 placements per angle.
           
           The calculations involve determining the valid range for the object's center based on the rotated dimensions. I'll carefully generate a set of 10 positions for each angle of rotation.  The result will be a list of 50 tuples, each containing the surface index (0), the rotation angle, and the x and y coordinates of the object's center. After rigorous checking and ensuring that I have exactly 50 placements, I'm ready to proceed.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object 4: A Collision-Averse Approach**
           
           My primary objective is to strategically place object ID 4 (with dimensions roughly 0.09 x 0.09) on surface 0, ensuring it doesn't collide with the pre-existing object ID 6 (currently at `(-0.088934, -0.088934)`) on the same surface. Object 6's AABB extends from (-0.135, -0.135) to (-0.0428, -0.0428), a region to be avoided. Since object 4 shares a similar size and a square shape, I anticipate numerous feasible locations, provided I rigorously adhere to collision avoidance.
           
           To achieve this, I'll leverage a grid-based approach across various rotations (0, π/6, π/3, π/2, 2π/3). For each angle, the procedure is as follows:
           
           1.  **AABB Calculation:** I'll compute object 4's effective width and height considering the chosen rotation angle.
           2.  **Valid Placement Zones:** Next, I'll determine the valid range within the surface's boundaries, adjusting for object 4's dimensions.
           3.  **Grid Generation:** I will create a grid of potential object-center positions within these valid zones.
           4.  **Collision Checks:** Finally, for each grid point, I'll assess potential collision with object 6 using a carefully defined collision-detection method. I'm focusing on validating the `collides_x` and `collides_y` based on if the min/max coordinates of objects overlap.
           5.  **Placement Validation:** Positions where no collision is detected will be recorded as valid placements.
           
           Because of object 6's placement in the bottom-left corner of the surface, I'll be more diligent in making sure object 4 is placed well to avoid collision. I will ensure that the min/max coordinates are accounted for to detect any sort of conflict. If it does not collide, then it will be added to my list of non-colliding poses for object 4.

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Approach to Find Stable Placements:**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've been tasked with placing object ID 8 on surface 0, and I need to find 50 stable positions. The catch? I have to avoid collisions with two other objects, ID 6 and ID 4, which are already placed. This is straightforward, but I need to do it correctly and find 50 of them, and I also have 5 different angles to place these at.
           
           First, I define the playing field, a square surface with coordinates provided: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           I've got the dimensions and placement information for objects 6 and 4, which I'll treat as fixed obstacles. I calculated the axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) for both. Object 6 is in the bottom-left corner, and Object 4 is to the left of the center.
           
           Now, for object 8, I know its size. To check for overlap, I consider 5 different angles: `0, pi/6, pi/3, pi/2, 2pi/3`.
           For each angle, I will compute the effective bounding box dimensions. This will allow me to consider the space where object 8 can reside.
           I will generate a grid of candidate placements on the surface, with a 5x5 grid, for each angle. Each candidate position needs to be checked against obstacles 6 and 4, in addition to the boundary, to check if each candidate is a valid placement.
           
           For each candidate position, I check for overlap.
           So, I compute its AABB.
           Then, I check to see if its AABB overlaps with the AABB of object 6.
           I also check if it collides with object 4.
           If it doesn't collide with either object, and it remains within the boundaries of the surface, I consider this a valid position.
           
           Once I have the 50 valid locations across these positions and angles, I will have the final solution. The space is relatively clear except where the two objects are located. I expect most valid positions will be on the right or top-left corner.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object ID 5**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find 50 valid placements for Object ID 5 on Surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into Objects 6, 4, and 8, which are already in place. Surface 0 is a square, centered at the origin, with sides of 0.27 units. Object 5 is almost square, with dimensions close to those of the obstacles.
           
           First, I've got the bounding box information for all the obstacles, pre-calculated and readily available. Object 5 has dimensions, and I know I need to rotate it to find suitable placements. To avoid overlaps, I'll iterate through five different angles: 0, π/6, π/3, π/2, and 2π/3 radians. For each rotation angle, I calculate the object's effective width and height, essentially its AABB, using the given dimensions.
           
           I'll then determine the valid region on Surface 0 for the object's center point. The center needs to stay within the surface's boundaries, minus half the object's effective dimensions to avoid going off the edge. This defines the minimum and maximum X and Y coordinates for the object's center. For each angle, I will generate a 5x5 grid of potential placements within the valid region.
           
           For each candidate position, I'll calculate the actual AABB of Object 5. And then, here's the crucial part: I check for collisions between this calculated AABB and the AABBs of each of the three obstacles. A collision happens if the AABBs overlap. If no collisions are detected, I've found a valid placement, and I add it to the list. I'll stop the search when I find 50 unique valid placements.
           
           In order to optimize this, I have a few notes. The objects are roughly square, so their bounding boxes are always the same - so this makes the calculation trivial and fast. We can also precompute some of the dimensions of bounding boxes. Further, when I evaluate where to place objects, I am not checking all possible locations, but instead prioritizing those with the most free space. The grid placement strategy will increase diversity of object locations.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: A Detailed Analysis**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with a spatial problem: placing Object 7 onto Surface 0, ensuring it doesn't bump into any of the existing objects (6, 4, 8, and 5) and that it stays within the surface's boundaries. Since I am an expert in this field, I know the best approach here is to use AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) and collision checks. I also know that since the new object is a square, the math will be a bit more predictable.
           
           First, I define some AABB helper functions, like creating an AABB given an object's position, angle, and dimensions. I also have a function to test if two AABBs are overlapping, which is fundamental to collision checks.
           
           Here's how I'll proceed:
           
           1.  **Define and populate AABBs:** I'll represent each of the existing objects (6, 4, 8, 5) as AABBs, using their provided placement information. I'll need to do the same for the object I'm about to place (Object 7).
           2.  **Define a Grid:** Then, I'll place my new object by creating a grid over the surface (10 by 10) for each of five test angles (0, pi/6, pi/3, pi/2, and 2pi/3). I'll calculate effective dimensions (width and height) using the angle of the object.
           3.  **Check for Collisions:** For each position and rotation angle, I will use my collision checker to see if it collides with each other existing object.
           4.  **Validate Placement:** If there are no collisions, I have a valid placement. I store up to 50 of these.
           
           I am using a square object that simplifies the calculations when rotating: the max extent for rotation is when theta = pi/4 and can be simplified as `sqrt(2) * object_size_x` for all cases.
           
           I know from prior experience that collisions will likely occur, so I'll need to make intelligent choices about where to place the grid points. The known positions of objects have created several blocked spaces. The best positions are likely on the top or on the right.
           
           The most likely free spots are the top-right and possibly the bottom-right and top-left corners. This is based on examining existing AABB locations. I'm going to set my grid to be dense (10 by 10) because I want to maximize my options.
           
           I've carefully checked my code for accurate results based on the parameters I'm using. I will run the code and report the resulting placements.

Since I am an expert in this field, I know the best approach here is to use AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) and collision checks. I also know that since the new object is a square, the math will be a bit more predictable.
           
           First, I define some AABB helper functions, like creating an AABB given an object's position, angle, and dimensions. I also have a function to test if two AABBs are overlapping, which is fundamental to collision checks.
           
           Here's how I'll proceed:
           
           1.  **Define and populate AABBs:** I'll represent each of the existing objects (6, 4, 8, 5) as AABBs, using their provided placement information. I'll need to do the same for the object I'm about to place (Object 7).
           2.  **Define a Grid:** Then, I'll place my new object by creating a grid over the surface (10 by 10) for each of five test angles (0, pi/6, pi/3, pi/2, and 2pi/3). I'll calculate effective dimensions (width and height) using the angle of the object.
           3.  **Check for Collisions:** For each position and rotation angle, I will use my collision checker to see if it collides with each other existing object.
           4.  **Validate Placement:** If there are no collisions, I have a valid placement. I store up to 50 of these.
           
           I am using a square object that simplifies the calculations when rotating: the max extent for rotation is when theta = pi/4 and can be simplified as `sqrt(2) * object_size_x` for all cases.
           
           I know from prior experience that collisions will likely occur, so I'll need to make intelligent choices about where to place the grid points. The known positions of objects have created several blocked spaces. The best positions are likely on the top or on the right.
           
           The most likely free spots are the top-right and possibly the bottom-right and top-left corners. This is based on examining existing AABB locations. I'm going to set my grid to be dense (10 by 10) because I want to maximize my options.
           
           I've carefully checked my code for accurate results based on the parameters I'm using. I will run the code and report the resulting placements.
