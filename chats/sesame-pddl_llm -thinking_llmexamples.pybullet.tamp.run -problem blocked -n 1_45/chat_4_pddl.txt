           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base #o3 #o3 #o0))
           ((move_base #o3 v3 #o0))
           ((move_base v3 #o3 #o0))

           ((pick v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4))

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning for a Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, here's how I'd approach this. The goal `new-axiom@0()` is simply to get some object `?green` to be *both* `type(?green, v17)` *and* `on(?green, v18)`.  I can see that `type(v12, v17)` is already true in the initial state, so if I make `v12` my `?green` then I *only* need to ensure `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           The axiom for `on(?o, ?r)` says an object `?o` is on a surface `?r` if it's supported by that surface.  Looking at what I have, `v12` is initially *supported* by `v14` *but* it can be stacked on `v18`. I also see that there's a valid pose, `#o2`, for `v12` to be supported *by* `v18`! So, if I just get `v12` from its current pose and place it on `v18`, I should be good.
           
           To do that, I'll need a robot arm action sequence. First, the arm needs to be in the correct base configuration (not just `v3`) for picking and placing `v12`. I see a `move_base` action that goes from `v3` to a suitable base config, `#o3`. Then, I can *pick* `v12` from its current pose, using the correct grasp and arm trajectory.  Finally, I'll *place* `v12` onto pose `#o2` on top of `v18`, also using a pre-calculated grasp and arm trajectory.
           
           I'm confident that the sequence:  `move_base v3 -> #o3`, `pick v12 from v13`, `place v12 at pose #o2`, will do the trick because everything seems consistent with the initial conditions and I've carefully ensured the preconditions are met at each step. Also, the problem states that anything not *explicitly* true is *false* which makes those "unsafe" preconditions simpler to deal with. It looks like `v12` will be the green object I'm looking for. This appears to be the most direct path to the solution.
