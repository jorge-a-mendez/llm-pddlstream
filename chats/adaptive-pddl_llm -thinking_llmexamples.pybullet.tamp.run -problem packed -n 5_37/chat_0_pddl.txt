           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v20)
               Atom on(v12, v20)
               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of the Task**
           
           Okay, so I'm looking at this problem, and it's immediately clear we have a serious issue. The goal is to get `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` all onto `v20`. Simple enough on the surface: move them there. But the initial state shows these objects are currently on `v11`.  My experience screams "pick and place"!  We need to *manipulate* these objects.
           
           Let's break it down:  we have `on(object, v20)` as the target.  To get there, logically, we need an action like `pick` (to take the object from `v11`) and then `place` (to put it onto `v20`). That's standard object manipulation.
           
           But here's the kicker: the only action instance I have at my disposal is `move_base`. Just moving the base around won't help me with moving objects! I don't see any `pick` or `place` capabilities.  I can't *interact* with the objects in the world given these available actions.
           
           Essentially, with only `move_base`, I'm completely stuck. I have no means to alter the state of the world to satisfy the `on(object, v20)` goal. It's a fundamental mismatch between the capabilities I *need* (object manipulation) and the capabilities I *have* (base movement). This task, as presented, is simply **unachievable**.
