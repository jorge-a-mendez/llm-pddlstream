User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a central vertical wall at x = 0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the environment, including clusters in the upper-left, upper-right, and lower-right quadrants, and a few isolated boxes elsewhere. Obstacles 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are larger, while 11-20 are smaller.
           
           For the given target point {target_point}, I'll consider positions within a circle of radius 2 centered at the target. I'll prioritize positions that are clearly not within any of the known obstacles. I'll try to find positions on different sides of the target to offer diversity.
           
           Positions:
           (-0.738 -0.091)
           (-0.728 1.838)
           (0.407 -1.241)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     My previous attempts for the target point (1.9466326236724854, 1.9507033824920654, 0.20100000500679016) failed due to collision or no line of sight. Specifically, (-0.728, 1.838) collided with obstacle 10, which is a box in the upper-left quadrant. (-0.738, -0.091) and (0.407, -1.241) had no line of sight, likely due to the central wall (obstacle 5) or other smaller obstacles. The target is in the upper right quadrant. I need to find positions that are also in the upper-right or clear of the central wall. I'll focus on the area closer to the target point and try to stay away from the central wall and the upper-left quadrant.
