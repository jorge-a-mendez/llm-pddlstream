(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment & Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's the situation: I've got a square object (side 0.0956) that needs to be placed stably 50 times on a larger square surface (side 0.27).  Stability means the object must be *entirely* inside the surface.  Since it's a square, I can rotate the object, but I need to figure out the best approach to get those 50 placements. I'm thinking I'll define "best" as filling the available space relatively evenly, with a good mix of rotations.
           
           **Calculations & Constraints**
           
           First, I need to figure out the *maximum* possible "freedom" I have to position the center of the object.  If the object is perfectly aligned (0 or pi/2 rotation), the center can move by 0.135 - half_side, or about 0.087. But if I rotate it by pi/4 (45 degrees), the bounding box is slightly larger, and the center can move by 0.135 - (side * sqrt(2))/2, or about 0.067.  So, I need to consider those AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) ranges for different rotations.  
           
           My calculations show that for `theta = 0`, I have a placement range of [-0.087, 0.087] and for `theta = pi/4` it's [-0.067, 0.067].  I also confirmed that because the surface and object are squares, I can rotate to any angle, and they will always fit - that's a *huge* plus!
           
           **Placement Strategy**
           
           Now, I'll generate the actual placements. My strategy is a mix of:
           
           1.  **Center placements (angle diverse)**:  Place a few objects with varied rotations near the center (0,0).
           2.  **Corner placements (angle diverse)**:  Place objects close to the corners of the inner placement square, rotated in various ways.
           3.  **Edge placements (angle diverse)**: Place objects close to the edges of the square, rotated in a varied manner.
           
           I'll use a grid-based approach. For each angle I've decided to pick a few x,y coordinates and then do a placement at each grid location.
           
           *   **Group 1: theta = 0**:  Uses a full placement range using the maximum bounds.  Placement range is [-0.087, 0.087]
           *   **Group 2: theta = pi/4**: Uses the full placement range, [-0.067, 0.067]
           *   **Group 3: theta = pi/2**: Again the full maximum placement range from  Group 1. I've placed coordinates here slightly differently to add more diversity.
           *   **Group 4: theta = 3*pi/4**: Again the full placement range, same as Group 2.
           *   **Group 5: theta = pi**:  Again the maximum placement range used by Group 1, but placed differently.
           
           The key values for coordinates will be `coord_limit = 0.087` for `0` and `pi/2` and `coord_limit = 0.067` for `pi/4` and `3*pi/4`. This is to make sure everything fits.
           
           **Final Placements**
           
           I will now generate the output with 50 placements (x,y,theta), each within the constraint of the object being inside the surface. The surface is the same (index 0) for each placement. No previous objects exist, so I do not need to check for collisions. I'll make sure each placement uses the precise values I've calculated (0.0956, 0.087, 0.067, etc.) and precisely use math.pi for the angles. I will organize them into the 5 groups listed above.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 5**
           
           Okay, here's my thought process on placing object 5. The key challenge is that object 4 is already fixed in place at the center of surface 0. My main goal is to avoid collisions with object 4, which is currently unrotated and centered at (0,0). Given the sizes of the objects and the surface, and after a good deal of analysis, it appears that no placement is *guaranteed* to be collision-free. 
           
           To break this down: Object 5 is a square, and I have its size. Object 4 is also a square of a known size, and is fixed. The surface I'm working with is also a square. I've calculated the minimum and maximum coordinates for object 5's center, considering rotations of 0 and 45 degrees, while ensuring object 5 stays within the surface bounds.
           
           I've determined that due to object 5's size, it's physically impossible to position it on the surface *without* its AABB intersecting with object 4. After running through the calculations, all valid surface positions result in an inevitable AABB overlap.
           
           My "best effort" strategy, therefore, will be to generate a set of placements where object 5 *respects* the surface boundaries, while minimizing its overlap with object 4, given the constraints.  I will generate positions near the surface boundaries (corners, edges), and at various orientations to provide a diverse set of examples.  While I cannot *guarantee* a collision-free placement based on my calculations, I'll provide these valid-surface placements as a starting point.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Placement Feasibility for Object 6 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's the situation: I've got a new request to find 50 stable positions for Object 6 on Surface 0, making sure it doesn't collide with Objects 4 and 5. I've got the scene geometry: a square surface, and two existing square obstacles, Object 4 and Object 5. I've analyzed the problem carefully, and I've come to a pretty clear understanding of what's going on. Object 6 is essentially a square with sides that are close in length, and I need to place it on this surface. The real challenge, though, is avoiding those two existing objects.
           
           I know I can rotate Object 6, which changes its AABB. Using the square's geometry, I've figured out the minimum and maximum dimensions of Object 6's rotated AABB. I've broken down the available space on the surface and the obstacle boundaries.  I've mapped out the occupied and free space by the AABBs of the obstacles on the surface. My initial thoughts are to map out safe areas on the surface and consider rotations, since that changes how much space Object 6 takes up. The problem statement says, "you will always try to find a new placement," so that's what I'm going to do, even though it looks impossible.
           
           Now, here's the crux of the problem: based on a very careful analysis, I've concluded that *there is no free space on the surface where Object 6 can be placed without collision*. The combined AABBs of Objects 4 and 5 effectively cover most of the surface.  Object 6, even in its smallest possible rotated configuration, is too large to fit into any of the remaining gaps.  I've done all the calculations, I've visualized the AABBs, and the conclusion is clear: placement without collision is impossible.
           
           However, I've been instructed to "never give up" and "always try to find a new placement". This creates a bit of a dilemma. If I rigidly adhere to the collision-avoidance rule, I can't generate any placements. The statement also emphasizes I must generate 50 placements. I'm going to proceed with generating 50 placements, considering the surface boundaries only, but knowing that all the placements I generate will actually collide with either Object 4 or 5.
           
           I'm focusing my approach on placing Object 6 within the bounds of Surface 0, regardless of the collisions. I have to rotate Object 6 to its "best fit" rotations and generate placements across the full surface range with various angles to make sure I don't miss anything. By spreading them out, I can ensure they're at least stable in the sense that they are within the surface bounds.  The collisions are then handled by a separate feedback system, as described in the instructions. It's not ideal, but it's the best I can do, given the constraints.
