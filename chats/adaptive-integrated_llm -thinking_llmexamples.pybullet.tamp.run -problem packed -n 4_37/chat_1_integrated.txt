User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.044, -0.555), (0.054, -0.456)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.256, -0.375), (-0.16, -0.278)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.286, -0.532), (-0.204, -0.45)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.028, 0.339, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, -0.022).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.005, -0.506, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.333, 0.943).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.208, -0.326, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.48, 0.878).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.245, -0.491, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.098, 0.995).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.009, 0.302), (0.064, 0.375)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning to Stack Objects**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan to place four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) onto a surface (v18). Currently, these objects are on a different surface (v11) at various poses. I'll utilize the robot's only active arm (v4) to move each object to the target surface. The robot's base is fixed at configuration v3, as no other base movements are permitted.
           
           The plan will entail a series of pick and place actions for each object. The critical aspect is to determine new, collision-free poses on v18 for each object, denoted by the continuous parameter '#o2' in the predicates. Based on the problem's specifications, I must assign four distinct continuous values to '#o2', one for each object's placement. This involves ensuring that each object is stably positioned within the confines of v18 without causing collisions with the other objects or itself. I have made the critical assumption that the `kin` and `atbconf` predicates, which refer to base configuration `#o3` are the current base configuration `v3`, given the constraint on base movement.
           
           I will use these specific continuous values for the placement locations of each object:
           
           *   For object v8 on surface v18: (-0.08 -0.08 0.781 0)
           *   For object v12 on surface v18: (0.08 -0.08 0.781 0)
           *   For object v14 on surface v18: (-0.08 0.08 0.781 0)
           *   For object v16 on surface v18: (0.08 0.08 0.781 0)
           
           These are distinct, collision-free placements on v18, and all the z coordinates are at a height of 0.781, matching the height of the original placement surfaces.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`.

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **A Crippling Constraint: The Goal is Unattainable**
           
           Okay, so the user's critique is spot on. My previous plan was DOA. I was trying to leverage `pick` and `place` actions, but apparently, the only permissible action is `move_base`. Specifically, `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`, which translates to the robot simply scooting itself from point `v3` to point `v3` via trajectory `#o0`.  Effectively, this means the robot is rooted to its current location, at least operationally.
           
           The goal I'm trying to achieve is a specific spatial arrangement: `on(v8, v18)`, `on(v12, v18)`, `on(v14, v18)`, and `on(v16, v18)`. All of these objects need to be *placed* onto `v18`.  
           
           However, my initial state clearly indicates the objects are *currently* `on(v11)`. The initial state, when expanded, shows: `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`, and so on for the rest. So, I have objects sitting on `v11`, and I need them on `v18`.
           
           Given that I'm only allowed to *move the base*, I'm stuck. I can't interact with the objects at all. I have no way to pick them up, or put them down. The available action is useless. I'm essentially trying to move objects around with no means of interacting with them.
           
           The conclusion is inescapable: the provided constraints make the goal impossible. I need to inform the system that this is an unsolvable problem with the current action set. This problem is infeasible given the limited available actions.
