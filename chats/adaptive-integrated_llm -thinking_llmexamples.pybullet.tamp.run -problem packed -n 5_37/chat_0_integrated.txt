User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.001, 0.238, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.856, 0.517).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.224, -0.279, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.046, 0.999).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.051, -0.465), (0.035, -0.379)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.032, 0.464), (0.104, 0.537)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.034, -0.289), (0.108, -0.215)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.262, -0.317), (-0.186, -0.241)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.008, -0.422, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.99, -0.142).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.048, 0.191), (0.046, 0.286)).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (0.068, 0.501, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.017).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.071, -0.252, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.035, 0.999).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment: This Task is Unsolvable with the Given Actions**
           
           Okay, here's what I've got. I'm given a scenario where I need to get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` onto object `v20`. Currently, they're all sitting on `v11`.  My goal is clear: `on(obj, v20)` for each of these objects. To achieve this, I'd need to ensure each object is at the correct pose, and that it's *supported* by `v20`. That means, I'd also need a `supported` predicate for each object and `v20`.
           
           The robot has two arms, both empty, and the provided action instance is rather limited: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. It seems it doesn't even move the robot.
           
           The core issue? I can't *pick* up or *place* anything. I'm not given any `pick` or `place` action instances!  The allowed action instance,  `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, is utterly irrelevant to the actual manipulation required to move the objects. I need to move these objects from `v11` to `v20`. That inherently requires picking them up and setting them down.
           
           Given that I'm strictly bound by the provided action instances, and I'm missing the critical ones for picking and placing, this task is, frankly, impossible to achieve. The instructions are very clear: only listed action instances are allowed. I've got a problem that *cannot* be solved with the actions I'm allowed to use. It's a fundamental mismatch.
