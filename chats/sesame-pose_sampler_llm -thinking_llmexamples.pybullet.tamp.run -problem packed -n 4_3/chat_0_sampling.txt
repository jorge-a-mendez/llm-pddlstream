           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Summary of my reasoning:**
           
           I need to find 50 stable placements for an object on a surface. The object is almost a square, so I'll exploit that. Stability means the object's bounding box stays within the surface. I'll need to figure out the appropriate `theta` (rotation), `x`, and `y` coordinates for the object's center.
           
           Since it's nearly square, rotating it won't drastically change the effective bounding box size. I'll choose rotations that cover the space: `0`, `pi/4`, `pi/2`, `3pi/4` (though only need two rotations to make it work). For each rotation, I'll spread out the x and y coordinates evenly within the allowed space, making sure they're far enough apart to cover the surface, not too close to the edge.
           
           For `theta = 0`, the effective width and height are basically just the original dimensions. I'll calculate the bounds for `x` and `y` based on the surface size and the object's dimensions. Then, for both `x` and `y` I select some coordinates inside those bounds:  `x_bound_min`, half-way between `x_bound_min` and 0, 0, half-way between `x_bound_max` and 0, and `x_bound_max`. 5 points on each axis give 25 placements.
           
           For `theta = pi/4`, I do the same but the dimensions of the bounding box is a bit bigger because of the rotation. Again I generate 25 placements. This gives me 50 placements. I'll make sure to use the exact floating-point numbers in the output.  The code should generate 50 distinct positions with different theta values (0 or pi/4).  I'm ready to output the placement coordinates.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable and Non-Colliding Placements**
           
           The task at hand is to generate 50 stable and collision-free placements for a new object (ID 7) on a given surface. I have access to prior knowledge about a previously placed object (ID 5) with its exact position and dimensions, which occupies a significant portion of the surface's bottom-left corner. The dimensions of the objects must be considered and it is essential to avoid any overlap between the two objects.
           
           I begin by defining the surface's boundaries and the valid ranges for the new object's center based on the object's dimensions and rotation. Considering the object's dimensions and the surface boundaries, two main rotation angles (theta) will be examined: 0 radians (no rotation) and pi/4 radians (45 degrees rotation). The effective width and height change depending on rotation, which affects how I calculate the valid ranges.
           
           To prevent collisions, the placement algorithm must ensure that the new object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) never overlaps the existing object's AABB. I establish these conditions. For theta=0, valid placements would need the object to be to the right of the existing object, or above the existing object. When the rotation angle is pi/4, the object must be to the right, or above the existing object.
           
           To generate the 50 placements, I proceed in two steps.
           Firstly, for theta=0, I establish a 7x7 grid covering the valid x and y regions. Collision filtering is applied where the object will not collide. The same applies for theta=pi/4, establishing an 8x8 grid.
           Secondly, by filtering the established grid coordinates, and by iterating through a 7x7 grid. I obtain 25 valid (x,y) coordinates for `theta=0`, which do not cause a collision. Then, for the 45 degree rotation, which generates a grid of 64 placements. From the 64, by iterating through each placement, I can obtain a set of 25 that do not collide.

(Thoughts: **My Planning for Stable Object Placements**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with placing 50 stable instances of object ID 4 on surface 0, and I need to do it without any collisions with objects already there. My approach is methodical: I'll carefully consider the geometry, existing objects, and then generate and validate potential placements.
           
           First, I have to understand the layout. Surface 0 is a rectangular area defined by coordinates, and I'm given the dimensions of object 4. I also need to account for two pre-existing objects, 5 and 7, including their sizes, positions, and orientations. I have calculated the AABBs for these two existing objects.
           
           I'll start by defining the valid placement area on the surface for object 4. I'll need to calculate `w_eff` and `h_eff` values for the new object 4 at two different angles (0 and pi/4) and then determine the valid center range by taking into account the object's dimensions and surface boundaries.
           
           To avoid collisions, I'll use a collision detection strategy using AABB overlap checking: If two bounding boxes overlap on both the x and y axes, then I'll mark it as a collision. I will precompute a set of candidate placements by creating a grid of placements at specific angles, considering the surface boundaries and existing objects. And I'll run the collision check against objects 5 and 7 for each of these candidates.
           
           I will also need to consider the range of potential placements that I should focus on due to the location of the existing objects.
           
           So I'll generate the candidate placements first. After filtering out the candidates with collision issues, I'll select the non-colliding locations. If I don't get 50 placement points, I'll tune the grid parameters. Since there is more space on the right side of the surface, I can generate the grid to cover the area in that part of the surface with more concentration. I will use a helper function to calculate the AABB of the new object. In this way, I can test with a dense grid and ensure that the required number of placements is met.

(Thoughts: **Collision Detection and Placement Strategy for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 50 stable positions for a new square object (ID 6) on surface 0, while avoiding collisions with objects already placed. The surface is a simple rectangle, and I've got the dimensions and placements of the existing objects, along with their Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs). My main goal is to strategically place the new object such that it does not intersect with the existing objects' AABBs.
           
           First, I analyze the scene geometry and the placement data of the previously placed objects (IDs 4, 5, and 7). From this, I identify the occupied space, creating a list of AABBs for collision checks. I noticed that the existing objects are clustered towards the left side of the surface, creating an 'occupied wall' along its left edge. This observation suggests the right side of the surface as a suitable area for placement. I will also check against the other object's AABBs.
           
           My strategy involves generating candidate placements for object 6, calculating its AABB for each orientation (theta = 0 and pi/4), and checking for collisions with the previously placed object AABBs. I'm going to create a grid of points on the valid area for object 6, ensuring I have the grid dense enough to generate 50 non-colliding positions. Based on what is previously occupied, I will focus on the right side and center of the surface.
           
           To check for collisions, I'll use a simple AABB-AABB intersection test, adding a small epsilon for better precision. I'll test all possible candidate placements and continue to add until I find 50 valid places. Then I have done my task.
