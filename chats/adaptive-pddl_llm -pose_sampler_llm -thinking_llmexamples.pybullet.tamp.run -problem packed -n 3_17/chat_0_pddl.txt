(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Placing an Object 50 Times on a Surface**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable and distinct positions for an object with dimensions 0.098858... x 0.098858... on a square surface with corners at (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135).  This means I need to define the object's (x, y) center and its rotation (theta) for each placement.  I'll ensure all placements are *fully* contained within the surface.
           
           First, I determine the effective size of the square object when it rotates. When it is aligned with the axes (theta = 0, pi/2, etc.), its half-extents are simply half its side length.  This means the center of the object can move within a smaller square area to ensure it stays fully inside the surface.
           
           If I allow *any* rotation, the maximum extent of the object in any direction is the half-diagonal.  This smaller "bounding" square is what needs to fit inside the surface.
           
           To create the 50 placements, I'll use a strategic combination of these constraints.  I'll start by generating 25 positions where the object is *not* rotated (theta = 0). For these, I'll use a fine 5x5 grid of (x, y) coordinates covering the larger range of motion *if the object's AABB is aligned with the axes*. This gives me a diverse set of starting positions.
           
           For the next 25 positions, I introduce rotation. I'll pick theta = pi/8, a reasonable angle that will rotate the object but isn't aligned on the axes.  The surface area for center movement is more limited for a rotated object. The object's center must be within the smaller bounding square defined by the diagonal. I'll again generate a 5x5 grid of (x,y) positions inside that bound.
           
           This method will generate a variety of unique and stable placements.
           
           The precise calculations for the limits are:
           For *no* rotation:
           x in [-0.085570893644732295, 0.085570893644732295]
           y in [-0.085570893644732295, 0.085570893644732295]
           
           For rotations, the range is smaller:
           x in [-0.0650956714839467, 0.0650956714839467]
           y in [-0.0650956714839467, 0.0650956714839467]
           
           This combined approach will generate a good distribution. I have verified all the bounds are correct.

(Thoughts: **Planning Placement of Object ID 4**
           
           Alright, let's break this down.  The feedback I got on object ID 5's placement is irrelevant for now. That's a previously placed object, and this request is for ID 4.  If I need to place them together later, I'll revisit that successful placement of ID 5, but not for this current task.
           
           My primary concern is finding a stable placement for object ID 4 on surface 0, avoiding any fixed obstacles. The scene description and object extents for ID 4 are the key information.
           
           Surface 0 is defined as the square: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). Object ID 4's dimensions are almost the same as the previous one: size_x and size_y are each 0.09798435739400238. I'll take `s_x = s_y = 0.09798435739400238` and compute `s_half = 0.04899217869700119`.
           
           Now, I'll calculate the valid ranges for the object's center based on two orientations, just like last time:
           
           1.  **Axis-Aligned (theta = 0):** The AABB is the object's original size.  Valid x and y ranges are identical: from `(-0.135 + s_half)` to `(0.135 - s_half)`, which is  `[-0.08600782130299881, 0.08600782130299881]`.
           2.  **Rotated (any theta):**  For rotation, I'll use the smallest enclosing AABB, which is  `sqrt(2) * s_half =  0.06928203230275509`. The range for x and y becomes `[-0.06571796769724491, 0.06571796769724491]`.
           
           The strategy will be similar to before. I'll generate a diverse set of 50 placements: 25 placements at theta = 0, and 25 at theta = pi/8.
           
           For placements with `theta = 0`: use the grid, with values calculated between -0.08600782130299881 to 0.08600782130299881.
           For placements with `theta = pi/8`: use the grid, with values calculated between -0.06571796769724491 to 0.06571796769724491.
           
           I'll then use these calculations to generate the placement configurations, ensuring I have exactly 50.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object ID 6**
           
           Okay, so I've got this square object (ID 6) I need to place 50 times on a surface (Surface 0), avoiding collisions with two existing objects (IDs 4 and 5).  These objects are already taking up space in the bottom-left corner of the surface.  My plan is to represent all the objects with their AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) and then iterate across the surface with an AABB check for all of my placements.  The important thing is to have a good grid in order to place the objects in a stable manner. I want to keep the calculations as fast as possible.
           
           I calculated the AABB size for ID 6.  Based on the surface size and object sizes, there's a valid region to put the center of this new object. Also, I calculated the placement constraints such that the new objects are completely within the given region. If there is a rotation, the diagonal of the AABB would increase in size.
           
           I'm starting by calculating the valid region. When the object's orientation (`theta`) is zero, it's pretty straightforward, just a slightly smaller square. But if it's rotated, I have to account for the object's diagonal and how that affects the bounds of the AABB.
           
           Now, the tricky part is collision detection. Since the existing objects are close to the corner, I'll have to adjust the grid I generate to avoid any overlap. I'll represent the existing objects as AABBs and then do a simple intersection check with the proposed placements of ID 6. The easiest way will be to just create the grids in the area, check for collisions, and then filter accordingly.
           
           The calculations for placement bounds and safe regions are:
           
           *   For `theta = 0`, the center can move in a range from `[-0.085564, 0.085564]` for both X and Y.
           *   For any other rotation angle, the range decreases to `[-0.06508, 0.06508]`.
           
           I observed that the existing obstacles are positioned right at the corner, so I have to adjust my positioning. Given the size of the new object, it means I have to calculate threshold positions at the right and the top of the occupied region to avoid collisions and add the constraint when I am checking collisions.
           
           My strategy now is this:
           
           1.  **Generate a Grid:** I will generate a 6x6 grid of candidate placements for `theta = 0` and a 7x7 grid for `theta = pi/8`.
           2.  **Filter for Collisions:**  I'll filter the points from the grid to guarantee no intersection with existing objects. Since the valid region for the centers has an occupied bottom-left corner, I'm setting a threshold `x > thresh` or `y > thresh` to avoid collisions.
           3.  **Refine (if necessary):** If I don't get enough valid points after filtering, I might need to adjust the grid density or try a slightly smaller rotation increment.
           
           I generated the list of x and y coords, and performed the calculations to check if the point collides with the pre-existing objects.
           
           In the end, I have 27 valid points for `theta=0` and 24 points for `theta = pi/8`. I simply take the first 50 points, 25 points from each rotation and I am set.

Also, I calculated the placement constraints such that the new objects are completely within the given region. If there is a rotation, the diagonal of the AABB would increase in size.
