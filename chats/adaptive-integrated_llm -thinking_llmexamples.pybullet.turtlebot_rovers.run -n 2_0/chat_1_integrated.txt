           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Finalized Plan for new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, here's the game plan, based on my expert analysis. We need to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which boils down to getting two images, two analyses, and specific configurations for the rover. Hereâ€™s what I'll do, step-by-step:
           
           1.  **Image Recon (Using Rover v12):** First, I'll send rover `v12` to configuration `#o3` with coordinate (0.0, 1.0) to get a clear view of both objectives. Then, I'll calibrate the camera and take two images: one of objective `v17` and another of objective `v18`.
           2.  **Move to Comms:** After getting the pictures, `v12` has to be repositioned to configuration `#o0` with coordinates (0.0, -1.75). From this location, the rover can establish communication.
           3.  **Sending the Data:** Now, with the proper comms, Iâ€™ll send the images of `v17` and `v18`.
           4.  **Sampling for Analysis:** Next, I'll move `v12` to sampling configuration `#o5`. This isn't a continuous coordinate I have to specify (the prompt implies it will be provided or computed), but it's important for the *sample* action. I'll get samples of two rocks, one stone (type v2) and one soil (type v6).
           5.  **Send Analysis to Lander:** Then, I move `v12` back to the communication configuration `#o0`. The analyses of the two rocks get sent to the lander (`v9`).
           6.  **Free up Store and Return:** After the analyses are sent, the store of `v12` is full. So, the store has to be emptied by dropping the sample of the stone. After this, a second soil sample can be taken, its analysis sent, and then the soil sample dropped to free up store. I move `v12` back to its initial location `v13` (1.0, -1.75) from `#o0`. This will satisfy the final `atconf` condition.
           
           **Configurations Summary:**
           
           -   `(#o0 v12 #o1 v9): (0.0 -1.75)`  (Communication configuration)
           -   `(#o3 v12 #o4 v17): (0.0 1.0)`  (Image Configuration, target is objective 17)
           -   `(#o3 v12 #o4 v18): (0.0 1.0)`  (Image Configuration, target is objective 18)
           
           That's the entire action sequence and required configuration values. I have checked for all conditions of `new-axiom@0()` and I have fulfilled it. I am ready to implement and execute this plan.

(Thoughts: **Refining Rover Configurations for Mission Success**
           
           Okay, so the previous plan failed because my proposed continuous configurations for communication and image-taking hit that pesky obstacle, `v19`. I need to find new configurations that are collision-free. I've re-evaluated the geometry and here's what I've determined:
           
           *   **Communication Configuration (`#o0`):** I need to talk to `v9`.  My current position `v13` isn't suitable, and the old `#o0` was directly on top of the wall.  I need a position *left* of the wall, so I'm going to try `(-1.0, -1.5)`.  This puts me close to `v9` and clear of the obstruction.
           
           *   **Image-Taking Configuration (`#o3`):**  I need to see both `v17` and `v18`. The old `#o3` was also on the wall. Since the objectives are near the y-axis, I need to be *near* the wall but not on it. I'll place my position to the right of the wall at `(0.1, 1.0)`. This position has line-of-sight to both objectives.
           
           *   **Sampling Configuration (`#o5`):**  This is a bit more complicated. I need to sample several rocks. The "above" predicate has to be interpreted. The rocks are scattered both left and right of the wall. Given the way the initial state is set up and the goal of analyzing two rocks, I can't have a single `#o5` above all the rocks. I am interpreting this to mean that `#o5` needs to be near any of the rocks needed for the analysis. For both rocks I need, they are on the right side of the obstacle. So I'll place the robot at `(1.0, 0.0)`. This should allow me to sample both.
           
           Now that I have these new collision-free configurations, I have to make sure the motion predicates defined in the initial state cover all the needed transitions.  All transitions required by the plan are covered. The rover `v14` remains at `v15`. Finally, all conditions for the crucial `new-axiom@0()` action are met. The plan should work this time!

(Thoughts: **Rover v12 Configuration Review**
           
           Alright, after reviewing the feedback, it's clear I need to revisit the configurations for rover `v12`. Specifically, the obstacle `v19`, a vertical wall at x=0, is causing issues. The goal is to avoid collisions while ensuring line-of-sight for both communication and image capture.
           
           **Communication Configuration**
           
           I've decided to place `v12` at  `(-0.1, -1.75)` for communication with the lander `v9`. This location is to the left of the obstacle, ensuring a clear line of sight. Given the lander's position, this should work.  I am confident in this placement.
           
           **Image Capture Configurations**
           
           The original plan for imaging was giving me issues. The feedback made me look harder, I've had to adapt and be explicit in the geometry.  I'm setting up two image taking positions: one for objective `v17` is at `(0.6, 1.0)`, and the other at `(-0.6, 1.0)` is for `v18`. This strategy allows line of sight by ensuring the rover is on the correct side of the wall.
           
           **Sampling Configuration**
           
           I'm placing `v12` at `(1.0, -1.0)` for sampling rocks `v3` and `v5`. This puts the rover closer to the rocks while on the correct side of the wall to ensure it's collision-free. I've chosen this so that it can move easily to the sampling location from the initial position and then to the communication site.
           
           The proposed values ensure I have a clear path of sight, I'm confident it will work out, with the rover following this sequence.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing Reachability and Task Division**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with devising a plan for these two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, to accomplish a set of goals. The main issue, as I see it, is how to handle the "not reachable" errors I'm getting. It seems that the specific (x, y) coordinates I'm suggesting for the rovers to move to are problematic. It's frustrating because the problem statement says I *must* generate these coordinates.
           
           I suspect these "not reachable" errors are about more than just collision detection, it also relates to the motion planning module. The rovers start at specific configurations on opposite sides of a barrier. I'm trying to ensure the rovers do not try to move to configurations that are on the wrong side.
           
           My initial thought was to use `v12` (starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`) for tasks on the right side of the barrier and `v14` (starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`) for tasks on the left. However, this raises questions about how they would communicate the gathered images and analyses. It looks like both rovers can communicate with `v9` so the original plan still works! So I'm back to having a single rover doing everything.
           
           Now, here's the issue: The goal requires both rovers to *image* two targets, one on each side. The fact that the initial state contains the `imagevisible` predicates suggests that the goal *must* be achievable by both rovers. But, if a rover cannot cross the barrier, or *cannot* get closer than `imagerange=2` from these targets, it can't achieve it. However, since the prompt states that I *must* specify those values, I'm forced to try to come up with *some* values that will work. This also means that I can't be sure if that configuration is correct.
           
           I need to get *around* this problem. If I can prove both sides can be reached, the goal is possible.
           
           I've got a plan to try:
           *   Have one rover, `v12`, complete all the objectives.
           *   Pick a config `(x, y)` for the objectives on `v17` and `v18` that are closer to those initial starting coordinates but are still clear of the obstacle.
           
           My goal is to minimize `y` changes and keep `x` away from the barrier. I'll make a final, hopeful attempt with these very specific coordinates. If it fails, I'm left with the troubling conclusion that it may not be possible, or the motion model is very different. I just have to hope the motion planner works for these coordinates!

(Thoughts: **A Summary of My Thought Process:**
           
           Okay, here's the deal. I'm trying to figure out a plan, but I keep running into this "not reachable" problem with the rover, specifically `v12`.  It seems like any configuration I propose, whether it's close to `v12`'s starting point or further away, gets flagged as unreachable. The initial assumption was that the `v19` wall was blocking, but after some close examination and size assumptions, I'm fairly certain the problem isn't purely a collision issue since my calculations for the AABB check out. It's about finding configurations that make the rover base reachable by following an established motion path.
           
           I've been carefully checking the reachability and collision constraints. `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)` and I'm targeting things like objectives `v17` and `v18` that are *high up* in the Y-axis.  This has led to my Y-axis being a problem. It seems like the constraints on vertical movement are tighter than I initially thought. I've re-calculated the safe zones to be sure I'm avoiding collision with the `v19` barrier. But, based on the problem specification, all the configuration choices are reachable.
           
           I've carefully considered the case where `v12` has to be used for the tasks, as well as the cases where `v14` needs to be used for those tasks. Since I'm working with a single `v12`, I've tried to keep the vertical motion as minimal as possible, but this complicates the imaging/sample actions.
           
           What's really making this difficult is this requirement to provide the *exact* (x, y) continuous values. The problem isn't about avoiding the wall, it's about the Rover base's moveability. The fact that the initial state explicitly states that this is possible suggests the key is finding the right values, not an impossibility.
           
           I've considered using both rovers, with `v14` doing the communication because `v14` starts on the opposite side of `v19`. However, the PDDL domain definition requires me to use `v12` *and* to get the imaging data.
           
           I'm now going to focus on picking `x` values that are robustly outside the danger zone around `v19` (to make sure it's valid for collision) and trying various vertical coordinates (`y`) to see if I can find values that are reachable. I'm also going to see if matching the known starting position `x` makes a difference.
           
           This is a tricky puzzle, but I'm getting closer. I just have to pick those *perfect* numbers!
