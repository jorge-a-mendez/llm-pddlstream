           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching the Unreachable: A Dead End in the Rovers Domain**
           
           Okay, here's the situation: I'm staring down the `new-axiom@0()` goal in this rovers problem. It looks deceptively simple at first, but after a deep dive, I'm pretty sure it's a dead end.
           
           First, I broke down the goal conditions. It needs the rovers to have images and analysis reports, along with some positional facts. My initial assessment was that the initial state already satisfied some conditions, but some required actions.
           
           My gut reaction was that there were some missing actions; that is, the actions that aren't there would not let me achieve the goal. However, upon a closer look, the only permitted actions are `move` and `drop_rock`. These actions primarily deal with moving rovers and dropping rocks; they have no connection to the imaging and analysis required for this goal!
           
           The `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates are the Achilles' heel here. They're explicitly stated as goals, and the initial state doesn't magically make them true. Moreover, the only action I can use is `move` which doesn't affect the goal. So, I went over the definitions of `new-axiom@0()` and the problem constraints. I see that there are only two actions, and that there are several things that are required, and that I can't derive the goals with only `move` and `drop_rock`.
           
           There's no way to reach these goal conditions, as the given actions have no effect on them. Without the actions that are not permitted, those images and analyses can't be obtained. I suspect there's a problem in the design. The constraints and axioms don't allow a solution with the available actions. This goal is impossible. It's time to flag this as unsolvable.
