           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes two rovers, v12 and v14, each with a camera (v10) and a store (v16). There are several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) of different types (v2 for v1, v3, v4 and v6 for v5, v7, v8). There are also two objectives (v17, v18) that can be imaged, and a lander (v9) for communication. Both rovers are currently at their respective home configurations (v13 for v12 and v15 for v14).
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` represents a complex state that requires several conditions to be met simultaneously:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover v12 is at configuration v13 (already true).
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover v14 is at configuration v15 (already true).
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: Store v16 on rover v12 is free (already true).
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: Store v16 on rover v14 is free (already true).
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: An image of objective v17 in mode v11 has been received.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: An image of objective v18 in mode v11 has been received.
           7. `type(?stone, v2)`: Some object is of type v2 (e.g., v1, v3, v4).
           8. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: That object of type v2 has been analyzed.
           9. `type(?soil, v6)`: Some object is of type v6 (e.g., v5, v7, v8).
           10. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: That object of type v6 has been analyzed.
           
           From the available action instances, only `move` and `drop_rock` are possible. However, `drop_rock` is only applicable if the store is full, which is not the case initially (`free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true). The `move` actions don't change the configuration, as the destination is the same as the current configuration.
           
           This means we cannot perform any actions to change the state.
           Let's analyze what the goal requires and if it's already met or achievable:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are true.
           - `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true.
           - `type(v1, v2)`, `type(v3, v2)`, `type(v4, v2)` satisfy `type(?stone, v2)`.
           - `type(v5, v6)`, `type(v7, v6)`, `type(v8, v6)` satisfy `type(?soil, v6)`.
           
           The remaining conditions are:
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (e.g., `receivedanalysis(v1)` or `receivedanalysis(v3)` or `receivedanalysis(v4)`)
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (e.g., `receivedanalysis(v5)` or `receivedanalysis(v7)` or `receivedanalysis(v8)`)
           
           None of the actions `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`, or `calibrate` are provided in the list of valid action instances, even though the initial state has the preconditions for some of them. For example, `imagevisible`, `onboard`, `supports`, `atconf`, `calibrated` (after calibration), `comvisible`, `objective`, `mode`, `haveimage` would be needed for `take_image` and `send_image`. Similarly, `above`, `store`, `atconf`, `free` would be needed for `sample_rock`.
           Since no actions are available to acquire images, send images, sample rocks, or send analyses, it is impossible to achieve the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` parts of the goal. Therefore, the goal is unreachable given the restricted set of allowed actions.
           
           The goal is not achievable with the provided list of valid action instances.
