(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning for Placement Generation**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing this object – ID 7, dimensions roughly 0.08 by 0.08, onto surface ID 0, a 0.27 x 0.27 square centered at the origin. I need 50 stable placements, meaning the object's fully contained within the surface boundaries.
           
           My first step is to establish the constraints for a valid placement. I know that for a given rotation (theta) of the object, its bounding box will change slightly, and its center must lie within the surface's boundaries minus half the rotated object's bounding box dimensions. The key here is calculating the effective width and height of the rotated object's bounding box. For a given `theta`, the effective width (eff_sx) is `obj_sx * |cos(theta)| + obj_sy * |sin(theta)|` and the effective height (eff_sy) is `obj_sx * |sin(theta)| + obj_sy * |cos(theta)|`. Then, the valid x range is `[-surf_half_width + eff_half_x(theta), surf_half_width - eff_half_x(theta)]` and the valid y range is `[-surf_half_width + eff_half_y(theta), surf_half_width - eff_half_y(theta)]`.
           
           Since my object is almost square, there's not much difference between `obj_sx` and `obj_sy`. It makes calculations easier to assume them equal, `obj_s`, for approximation.
           
           My strategy involves generating placements for different rotations (theta). I need to generate x and y coordinates that span the valid ranges for each theta I choose. First, I compute several values of theta, (0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, pi/2), and for each I calculate the ranges and construct a 3x3 grid centered in that space. That gives me 45 placements. I fill out the final 5 slots with values using more theta values centered at (0,0). I then create a set of valid placements.  I'm aiming for diversity in both position and orientation. I will now run the program.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning for Object 5 Placement**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback indicating that object 7 is successfully placed at a specific location on the surface, and I need to avoid collisions with it for future requests. However, this current request concerns a *new* object, ID 5, and I need to determine 50 stable placements for it.
           
           The scene consists of a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27. Object 5 is also nearly square, with dimensions approximately 0.098 x 0.098.
           
           Object 7 is located at approximately (-0.135, -0.135) to (-0.0552, -0.0552). This means it is in the bottom-left corner. So I will have to ensure that object 5 does not overlap with this area.
           
           My overall strategy is still to generate a diverse set of placements. I'll start by generating placements with various rotations (using theta values).
           
           Initially, I'll calculate the effective dimensions of object 5 for different rotations. Then, I'll generate a grid of potential placements, checking for collisions with object 7. I'll be using the provided collision check method to ensure there is no collision.
           
           I will generate many more than 50 placements to account for the filtering caused by the collision check. I will use a list of angles. I'll start with 14 angles in `thetas_grid` for grid generation to yield `14*9 = 126` initial positions. I'll then filter out any placements that collide with the AABB of object 7, and pick first 50 distinct positions.
           
           The angles that will be used are: `0, pi/12, pi/8, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, 5*pi/12, pi/2, 7*pi/12, 2*pi/3, 3*pi/4, 5*pi/6, 11*pi/12, pi`.
           Using the surface dimensions and object dimensions, I compute the range for placement on the surface by offsetting. I compute the size of object 5 based on rotation to make sure placement is possible. I then construct the x and y coordinates by defining `xmin`, `xmax` and `ymin`, `ymax`. I will generate a 3x3 grid using the computed x,y values. If the range is small, I just generate the center point only to save time.
           
           If I don't manage to get 50 distinct positions, I'll supplement with additional center placements (0, 0) for each angle. This should be sufficient. I will only add the placement if it is collision-free and not already present.
           
           This comprehensive approach will ensure that I provide a sufficient number of non-colliding and stable placements for object 5.

(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Placing the New Object**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable positions for a new object (ID 4) on surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into two objects already there (IDs 7 and 5).  I've got the dimensions and location of everything, including those pesky "no-go" zones.  Let me walk you through my plan:
           
           First, I need to understand where I *can't* put the new object.  I've calculated the AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) of objects 7 and 5, which are the rectangular regions they occupy.  This gives me the occupied space in both the X and Y dimensions.  I've noticed something crucial: object 7 and object 5's X ranges heavily overlap in the X direction (approximately from -0.135 to -0.0371).  Their Y ranges are mostly disjoint: Object 7 is further down on the y-axis, and object 5 is on the y-axis, right around y=0.
           
           This is my starting point: avoid that X-range.
           
           I'm going to take a systematic approach. Here are the steps I'm going to take:
           1.  **Angle Check:** I want to rotate the new object a set of angles, that I will have a larger set of angles generated, using a fine sampling from 0 to 2*pi so all potential collision zones can be sampled.
           2.  **Grid Generation:** For each angle, I'll generate a grid of potential center positions (x, y) on the surface. For an accurate search, 5 points per side on x and y give me 5x5 or 25 points.
           3.  **AABB Calculations:** For each potential (x, y) location and rotation angle, I'll calculate the AABB of the new object.
           4.  **Collision Check:** I will then check the newly generated object's AABB against the AABBs of both existing objects (IDs 7 and 5). I'll use a collision detection function, and if any of the object's axis ranges overlap.
           5.  **Placement Validation:** If the AABB of the new object *doesn't* collide with either object, I'll add that (theta, x, y) combination to my list of valid placements.
           6.  **Find enough Placements:** I'll keep generating and filtering placements until I find 50 *unique* valid placements. To ensure a correct approach, I will filter any extra placements to only return the first 50.
           
           I'm carefully considering the surface limits, avoiding collisions, and ensuring each placement is stable.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for New Object (ID 6)**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 6) on surface 0, avoiding collisions with three existing objects (ID 7, 5, and 4) that are already positioned.  I’ve meticulously analyzed the bounding box (AABB) coordinates of these pre-placed objects and defined the surface boundaries. Based on the shapes and positions of the obstructions, the most promising area for placement is the top-right quadrant of the surface.
           
           To locate non-colliding placements, I’ll iterate through 10 evenly spaced angles (0 to π) for the new object's orientation. For each angle, I will compute the effective size and valid positioning limits, accounting for the object's dimensions and ensuring it stays within surface 0.
           
           A key part of my strategy involves generating a 5x5 grid of potential center points within the valid positioning limits.  I will be scanning across the surface in a specific manner to start in less occupied regions first.
           
           To determine if a placement is valid, I’ll perform collision checks by comparing the new object's AABB with the AABBs of the existing objects. A placement is valid if the new object does not intersect with the others' AABBs. My collision checking is based on x and y overlap tests.
           
           I'll continue this process of generating and checking placements until I successfully identify 50 unique non-colliding locations.
