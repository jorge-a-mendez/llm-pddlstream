User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.136, 0.162), (0.231, 0.257)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.252, -0.494), (-0.153, -0.395)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.184, 0.209, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.258, 0.966).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.035, -0.507), (0.124, -0.418)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.202, -0.445, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.922, -0.388).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.08, -0.463, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.81, 0.587).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to get those objects where they need to be. The goal is clear: get v8, v12, and v14 all stacked nicely on v16.  I'm looking at the initial state and, like a good strategist, I'm already anticipating the necessary moves.  I'll be using arm v4, which is currently empty and ready to work.  My trusty base, v3, is also standing by.
           
           The key is this: I've got to move each object *from* its starting pose *to* a specific spot on v16.  This means three distinct poses on v16 are needed - a spot for each object!  I see that 'supported' predicate with v16 as the base, showing I'm on the right track. I *must* use distinct continuous values of `#o2` for each object.  That's where the fun of spatial reasoning begins.
           
           Since the base can move, the first step is to optimize the base location to avoid moving it, so to make it `v3`. I need to execute `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`. The `kin` predicate is my map for these motions.
           
           Next, it's a series of pick-and-place maneuvers.  Let's say v8 is first.  I need a `(pick)` action that moves it from v9 using arm v4.  But before I pick, I need that robot base `#o3` configuration. Then, I can execute `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)`, and the goal will be achieved to pick `v8`.
           
           The placement phase is where I define where it goes. Then `(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)` gets that first object where it needs to be. Same with the others - pick from their current poses, and then place them on `v16`. It's a repetition, each time placing at the specific pose of `#o2`.
           
           The trickiest part is the `#o2` pose definition for each object. They cannot collide, must all be fully within v16. I can't be inefficient with space. So I will ensure the location is inside `v16` for *stable* placement.
           
           Since I am an expert, I'll provide these coordinates. My goal: put them in non-overlapping configurations that are all contained within `v16`. So I'll pick (-0.06, 0.06) for v8, (0.06, 0.06) for v12, and (0.0, -0.06) for v14.
           
           The actions will be: move, pick, place.
           
           The cost for the base movement is 0, since `#o3` and v3 are the same. Each pick and place has a cost of 1.
           
           The `kin` predicates confirm the moves are valid and the poses will meet the requirements for stable placement. I have now completed this!
