User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.136, 0.162), (0.231, 0.257)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.252, -0.494), (-0.153, -0.395)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.184, 0.209, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.258, 0.966).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.035, -0.507), (0.124, -0.418)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.202, -0.445, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.922, -0.388).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.08, -0.463, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.81, 0.587).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **Plan Synthesis: Stacking Three Objects on a Surface**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan: I need to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all stacked on top of `v16`. Since I'm starting with a surface (`v16`) and all the objects supported on `v16` in the initial state, I'm thinking I can simply use the single pose, `#o2` and arrange the objects by varying pose continuous values in each case. To do this, I'll need to pick them up, and then place them down in their target positions with the help of the `kin` predicates to make sure the robot can reach and execute the action, which the base won't be moving since base config `v3` is provided.
           
           **Deconstructing the Problem:**
           
           *   Each object has the same goal: `on(object, v16)`.
           *   This translates to `atpose(object, #o2)` and `supported(object, #o2, v16)`. The surface `v16` is fixed.
           *   I can use arm `v4` for picking and placing with the default grasp `#o1`.
           *   The arm can do the picking/placing actions because the robot's state is `ataconf(v4, v5)` (with arm `v4` ready and `handempty(v4)`).
           *   The only moving part of the robot is the arm, and the base is fixed at `v3`.
           
           **Action Breakdown:**
           
           1.  **Object v8:**
               *   Pick `v8` from pose `v9`.
               *   Place `v8` at a *specific* instantiation of `#o2` on `v16`.
           
           2.  **Object v12:**
               *   Pick `v12` from pose `v13`.
               *   Place `v12` at a *specific* instantiation of `#o2` on `v16`.
           
           3.  **Object v14:**
               *   Pick `v14` from pose `v15`.
               *   Place `v14` at a *specific* instantiation of `#o2` on `v16`.
           
           **Crucial Step: Avoiding Collisions**
           
           The key here is choosing those unique instantiations of `#o2` such that the three objects don't bump into each other. I'll need to carefully consider the object sizes and the available space on surface `v16`, which is a small square (0.27m x 0.27m), with the center at (0,0). Given this, I can start by placing the objects in a row or slightly offset. To start, I am thinking of a triangle.
           
           **The Plan:**
           
           1.  `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           2.  `place(v4, v8, #o2_v8, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           3.  `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           4.  `place(v4, v12, #o2_v12, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           5.  `pick(v4, v14, v15, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           6.  `place(v4, v14, #o2_v14, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           
           **The Specific Poses:**
           *   **v8:** Center position (x, y, z): (-0.08, 0.08, 0.781)
           *   **v12:** Center position (x, y, z): (0.08, 0.08, 0.781)
           *   **v14:** Center position (x, y, z): (0.0, -0.08, 0.781)
           
           With these poses, the action should be completed.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Assessment of Goal Achievability**
           
           Alright, so the user's plan clearly violated the action constraints – a common oversight, but a crucial one. Looking at the situation, the robot *only* has permission to perform `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. Essentially, it can move its base, *but only to the same spot*.  This is effectively a no-op as far as changing the world state goes.
           
           My goal, as I understand it, is to have vertices `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` on `v16`. To achieve this, I absolutely need `pick` and `place` actions to manipulate these objects. But here's the kicker: those crucial `pick` and `place` actions are *not* in the permitted action list!
           
           Given the ridiculously limited set of available actions, it's immediately obvious: this goal is *unachievable*.  There's no way to physically interact with any objects, and a "move to the same spot" action is not going to get any vertices to a new location. It is a logical impossibility given the action constraints. I have to communicate this impossibility clearly, explaining the dependency on unavailable actions.
