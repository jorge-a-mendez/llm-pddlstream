           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning the Stacking Task**
           
           My objective is to create a plan that places objects v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18 onto surface v20, effectively achieving `on(v8, v20)`, `on(v12, v20)`, `on(v14, v20)`, `on(v16, v20)`, and `on(v18, v20)`. I will approach this by analyzing the current and desired states and formulating a sequence of actions.
           
           Currently, all five objects are `on(object, v11)`. The `on` predicate is satisfied when `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)` are true. My goal, therefore, requires transitioning each object from its current pose on `v11` to a new pose on `v20`.
           
           By examining the initial state, I see that v8 is at pose v9 and supported by v11, so `on(v8, v11)`. The same applies to the other objects with their respective poses. All target poses will be at `#o2` on surface `v20`.  The required action will be `supported(object, #o2, v20)`.
           
           To achieve the goal, I will use `pick` and `place` actions, leveraging the robot's arm `v4`. The prerequisites for `pick` involve `kin` (kinematics), `atpose`, `handempty`, `atbconf`, and safety checks (`NegatedAtom unsafeapproach` and `NegatedAtom unsafeatraj`). Similarly, `place` requires `kin`, `atgrasp`, `atbconf`, and corresponding safety checks.
           
           The key is that all necessary `kin` facts are available. I notice that all objects can be moved by the arm v4 in an arm trajectory `#o4`. With the provided kinematics, I can construct a sequence to pick up each object from its current location and place it on surface `v20` at the designated pose `#o2`. I will use `v4` because it is `handempty`.
           
           The plan, then, is a series of pick-and-place actions: pick `v8` from its current pose, place it on `v20`, pick `v12` from its pose, place it on `v20`, and continue for `v14`, `v16`, and `v18`. All necessary kinematics facts are provided. I can use grasp `#o1` at target base configuration `#o3` with base configuration `#o0`, and arm trajectory `#o4`.
           
           I must ensure the robot's base configuration (`atbconf(v3)`) does not change during the plan. Since the current plan does not require the base to move (`move_base` actions), it will not change. `atbconf(v3)` is true and will be satisfied for the duration of this plan.
           
           To summarize, my plan is:
           
           1.  `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           2.  `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           3.  `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           4.  `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           5.  `pick(v4, v14, v15, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           6.  `place(v4, v14, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           7.  `pick(v4, v16, v17, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           8.  `place(v4, v16, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           9.  `pick(v4, v18, v19, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           10. `place(v4, v18, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           
           With this sequence, I can be certain that I can achieve the intended goal. I am confident in the approach.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v18 v19 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v18 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`.

(Thoughts: **Unachievable Goal with Current Actions**
           
           Okay, so I've looked over the proposed plan, and it's immediately clear we have a problem. The user's right; those actions are invalid. The only action instance we're *allowed* to use is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  Essentially, that's just a "no-op" move – it *doesn't* actually move the robot anywhere, just indicates a trajectory.
           
           The real goal is to get those five objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18`) from their current spot (`v11`) to `v20`. That screams `pick` and `place` actions to me. But here's the kicker:  `pick` and `place` aren't *in* the allowed action instances list! We're hamstrung.
           
           Since we can't `pick` or `place`, the robot's stuck. It can run the `move_base` action, but that's not going to make a dent in the problem. It's just spinning wheels.  There's no way with this very limited set of allowed actions to actually *move* those objects and achieve the specified goal. The objective is simply unachievable.
