(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for a Square Object on a Square Surface**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a square object (side length ~0.095) on a square surface.  The object must be fully contained within the surface.  Since the object is a square, its bounding box dimensions remain consistent when rotated by multiples of π/2. I'm focusing on the *effective* AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) for containment, which varies with rotation for a square.  Therefore, I'll calculate the AABB of the rotated object to determine valid placements.
           
           The surface is a square of dimensions 0.27 x 0.27, so the object can fit even when rotated, as the maximum diagonal is smaller than the surface dimensions.  I need to vary the rotation (`theta`) and the (x, y) coordinates of the object's center.
           
           To maximize the number of distinct placements, I'm employing a systematic grid-based approach. I first calculate valid (x, y) ranges for different rotations, focusing on rotations from 0 to π/2 since the object's shape creates symmetry.  For each rotation, I'll generate a grid of (x, y) coordinates within the valid range, ensuring even distribution and covering all possible orientations.
           
           I'll start with rotations of 0, π/8, π/4, 3π/8 and π/2. I chose these angles, as they will provide a good representation of the possible rotations of the square object on the square surface. I’ve carefully derived the valid (x, y) ranges for each angle, considering the effective dimensions of the object with those rotations. I'll place these ranges inside their corresponding 2D grid, ensuring there are no overlapping placements.
           
           I'll calculate the valid ranges for each angle. Then, to reach the desired total of 50 placements, I'll strategically vary the density of the grid. For instance, for rotations like 0, I'll use a denser 5x5 grid. Other angles will have a less dense but still adequate coverage.
           
           Finally, to complete the 50, I'll include a π rotation at the center (0, 0), as its effective dimensions are the same as 0, this ensures no duplication.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object 7**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed object 6. Now, I need to figure out where to put object 7.  Object 7 is a square and I need to find 50 stable placements, ensuring that it doesn't collide with object 6.
           
           Object 6's placement is set, and it occupies a specific area in the bottom left corner. I've calculated the boundaries of object 6's bounding box (AABB) which is `[(-0.135, -0.135), (-0.0401, -0.0401)]`.
           
           Now I need to find 50 different locations, with varying rotations, for object 7. The surface bounds are `-0.135` to `0.135` in x and y.
           
           First, I need to figure out how to avoid collisions. I need to take into consideration the rotation. At `theta = 0`, I know what to do; at other angles, the bounding box of the object expands. I can compute an effective dimension `h` for any rotation angle.
           
           Essentially, I need to make sure that the center of object 7 doesn't fall within the collision region. The collision check is complicated because it changes with rotation, but I should be able to make some intelligent choices.
           
           For a fixed rotation, the center of object 7 needs to be: outside the bounds of the surface or above/to the right of the excluded region.
           
           At `theta=0`, the effective dimension will be s7 (0.072).
           The object 7 boundaries will become `x \in [ -0.098, 0.098]` and  `y \in [-0.098, 0.098]`
           Then, I define a collision zone where `x` and `y` center coordinates can't be. This will be the collision zone.
           
           The valid range for x is the surf boundaries for the center - the half dimension, same for y. For a collision to happen, both the x and y of object 7, centered, would need to fall within the collision regions, and these collision region coordinates depend on `theta`. I will start by focusing on theta=0. I will test other values of theta afterwards.
           
           So, I need to be careful to select the placements to be in the non colliding parts of the box, for theta=0, PI/4, PI/2.
           I will generate those and double-check those will fit inside the valid areas. I will make sure the placement lists work.
