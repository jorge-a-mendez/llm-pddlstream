           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable: A Deep Dive into Rovers' Limits**
           
           My objective is to fulfill the conditions of `new-axiom@0()`, a task in the `rovers` domain. This boils down to ensuring two rovers have received images, and that we've analyzed both a rock and soil sample. The initial state, however, presents a significant obstacle.
           
           The first four conditions of the axiom are already satisfied, I have to ensure  `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, receiving the analysis of some rock and of some soil.
           
           The core of the issue lies in the rovers' inability to perform their essential tasks.  To send images or analyses, the rovers need to be 'at the right configuration' to perform actions like  `send_image`, `sample_rock`. The rovers have to satisfy the `atconf` predicate to perform the actions. The  `atconf` predicate demands the rover's presence at certain configurations. My initial analysis revealed that rovers are initially configured at `v12, v13`, `v14, v15`, I would require them to take actions at  `#o3`, `#o5` and `#o0`.  The current configuration is given by  `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`.
           
           Unfortunately, the available `move` actions are limited to self-referential moves, i.e., moving rovers from a config to the same config, meaning they can't actually move. `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, for example, is valid only if the rover `v14` *is at* configuration `#o3`.
           
           Given this, the preconditions for all of the actions required to take images, calibrate, send data, and sample rocks (essentially the actions needed to satisfy the goal) can't be satisfied, because the required `atconf` predicates are *not* initially present, and the provided `move` actions aren't enough to change the rovers' locations. The goal is unachievable.
