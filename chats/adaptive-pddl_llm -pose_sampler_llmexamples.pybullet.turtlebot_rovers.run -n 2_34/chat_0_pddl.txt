User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with dimensions approximately 5x5 units, centered at the origin. There are several obstacles within the room.
           Obstacles 0-4 define the outer walls of the room, effectively limiting the robot's movement to x and y within [-2.5, 2.5].
           Obstacle 5 is a thin vertical wall along the y-axis at x=0, effectively dividing the room into two halves. This means the robot cannot cross x=0.
           Obstacle 6 is a rectangular block in the bottom-left quadrant.
           Obstacles 7, 8, 9, 10 are small square blocks in the top part of the room, two in the left half and two in the right half.
           Obstacles 11-20 are smaller, scattered obstacles within the room.
           
           My strategy is to try to find positions in the quadrant where the target point is located. Since x=0 is a wall, I will ensure that the robot's x-coordinate is on the same side of the wall as the target point. I will also try to keep a safe distance from the larger obstacles and walls. I will try to generate a diverse set of points within the allowed range and maximum distance from the target.
           
           For the given target point (-2.043132789184542 0.3524959141708846), it is in the top-left quadrant of the room (x < 0, y > 0). I will prioritize positions in this quadrant, avoiding obstacle 6. I will try to find positions with a range of distances and angles from the target, ensuring they are within the room boundaries and clear of known fixed obstacles.
