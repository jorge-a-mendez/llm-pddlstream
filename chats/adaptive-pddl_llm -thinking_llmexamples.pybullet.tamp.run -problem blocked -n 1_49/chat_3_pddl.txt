           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Okay, let's break down this planning problem.** My goal is to achieve `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which translates to placing an object of a certain `type` on another object.
           
           First, I examined the `new-axiom@0()` definition and saw that it requires finding an object that meets specific criteria: it must be `on` something (let's call it `v18`) and have a particular `type` (which, for this analysis, I'm just calling `v17`).
           
           Now, looking at the initial state, there are two objects, `v8` and `v12`, that have `type` `v17`. So either one could potentially be the solution.  The `on` predicate needs to be achieved via `supported` and `atpose`, as per its definition.
           
           Next, I analyzed the `supported` predicates, specifically those related to `v18`. I found that both `v8` and `v12` are `supported` at specific poses on `v18`. Specifically, `v8` can be placed on `v18` at pose `#o2` and `v12` can be placed at `#p0`.
           
           I then chose to focus on `v8` for now.  `v8` is currently on another object, `v11`, at pose `v9`. I want to move `v8` to `v18`, specifically placing it at `#o2`.  Given that the initial state indicates that `v8` is `supported` on `v18` at pose `#o2`, this is a feasible option.
           
           I then started formulating actions. My robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both of which are currently `handempty`. Let's use `v4` and, I will move `v8`.
           
           The plan would consist of these steps:
           1.  **Move Base:** I need to move the robot base to a suitable configuration for both picking and placing. Specifically, I found a `move_base` action that moves the base from `v3` to `#o3`.
           2.  **Pick `v8`:** The arm needs to pick `v8`. I then checked all preconditions, and it looks like I need to pick `v8` from `v9` at base config `#o3`, after base movement in step 1.
           3.  **Place `v8`:** The arm then needs to place `v8` onto `v18` at pose `#o2`, which, again, requires the base config `#o3`, after step 1 base movement.
           
           I carefully checked all the preconditions for these actions â€“ the kinematic constraints, the object states (`atpose`, `atgrasp`, etc.), and the robot's state (`handempty`, `atbconf`) -  to make sure they are valid at each step. Importantly, I also checked that the `move_base` action does not invalidate any of the facts.
           
           After performing these three actions, `v8` will be `on v18`, and `v8` already has type `v17`. Therefore,  `new-axiom@0()` will be satisfied. I verified that this leads to the goal state.
           
           Finally, I considered whether to choose `v12` instead of `v8`. I saw that `v12` could also be placed onto `v18` at another pose, `#p0`. However, the base configurations required to move, pick, and place `v12` are different, so it would involve more actions (I need to use move base twice) than with the approach involving `v8`.  Since the objective is to minimize actions, I determined the best plan uses `v8`.
           
           I am assuming that the cost metric is simply the number of actions to minimize. Therefore, the plan I formulated is the most efficient plan.
