           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching the Unreachable: A Frustrating Exercise in Planning**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get an object, let's call it `?green`, which has `type v17`, to be *on* `v18`.  Easy enough, right?  The initial state tells me I can use either `v8` or `v12` as my `?green` because they are both of `type v17`.  Cool.
           
           Now, to be *on* something means it needs to be at a pose that is supported by that thing.  Looking at the initial state, `v8` is currently supported by `v11`, not `v18`, and the same holds for `v12`.  So, the plan *should* involve moving one of these objects to a pose supported by `v18`.  That means picking it up and placing it somewhere else.  Standard stuff.
           
           Now, here's where things get sticky.  I check the available actions, looking at `pick` and `place`. The preconditions all check out *in theory*. I can see how, if I had the actions available, I'd pick `v8` from its current pose `v9` using arm `v4` and place it at `#o2` on `v18`. But... there's a catch.
           
           The "valid action instances" list is a real buzzkill. It says I'm only allowed to use `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  *That's it*.  No `pick`, no `place`, nothing else.  Just this one, useless action that does absolutely *nothing* to change the arrangement of objects in a way that helps me reach the goal.
           
           The problem explicitly says that *only* the provided actions are valid.  So, even though I see a clear path to the goal using `pick` and `place`, I'm *forbidden* from using those actions.  I've checked the constraints, re-read the problem, and there's no wiggle room. It is impossible to achieve the goal with the given actions.  Frustrating, but clear.
