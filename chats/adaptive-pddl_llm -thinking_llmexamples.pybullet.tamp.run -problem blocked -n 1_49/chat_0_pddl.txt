User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)

           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Action Limitations**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with the goal of achieving `new-axiom@0()` in the `pr2-tamp` domain.  I immediately recognize that `new-axiom@0()` translates to having an object of type `v17` be on object `v18`. This requires the `on` predicate to be true for some object `?green`, where `?green` is of type `v17`.
           
           My first instinct is to break down the `on` predicate. I see that it's composed of two conditions: `supported` and `atpose`.  This means I need to find an object `?green` that's supported by `v18` and positioned at a specific pose.
           
           Next, I scan the initial state. I identify that both `v8` and `v12` are of the required `type v17`.  I then need to figure out how to get either `v8` or `v12` onto `v18`.  I see that both are *already* supported by `v18` in the initial state, just *not* at their current poses. `v8` is on `v11` and `v12` is on `v14`.
           
           The plan to achieve the goal would be to pick up either `v8` or `v12` and place it at `#o2`.
           
           However, the key problem hits me when I look at the available actions. There's only one, `move_base v3 v3 #o0`.  This basically does nothing of value.  There are *no* `pick`, `place`, or other object manipulation actions available.  
           
           Without the ability to move objects, the goal of placing an object of type `v17` on `v18` is simply unreachable. The robot is fundamentally limited to only moving its base, which doesn't affect the state of the objects in the world.  Therefore, I have to conclude that given the available actions, I cannot achieve the desired `new-axiom@0()`.
