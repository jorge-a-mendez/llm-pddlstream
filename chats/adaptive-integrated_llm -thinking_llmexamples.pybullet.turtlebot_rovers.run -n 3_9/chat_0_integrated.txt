           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analytical Breakdown: An Unachievable Goal**
           
           My primary objective is to devise a plan that fulfills the requirements of `new-axiom@0()`. This seemingly straightforward task quickly reveals itself as insurmountable due to the constraints imposed.
           
           The crux of the matter lies in the definition of `new-axiom@0()`, which necessitates achieving several sub-goals: capturing and transmitting images (`receivedimage`), along with analyzing samples (`receivedanalysis`). While the initial state happily provides some preconditions, the core challenge is in fabricating these image and analysis results.
           
           To make progress, I examined the tools available to me: the given actions. Actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` are *essential* to this effort. However, they are conspicuously absent from the allowed list. 
           
           I meticulously combed through the initial state. The initial configurations of the rovers severely limit potential image capturing and communication. It becomes evident the rovers cannot "move" in a practical sense, only to re-iterate. I have no power to move the rovers to positions where they could *act*.
           
           The plan crumbles under the weight of this limitation. According to the rules, I can only use a restricted set of actions, which are incapable of achieving the necessary `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates. 
           
           The initial state does *not* pre-populate the goal requirements. Thus, the actions are the *only* avenue. As no actions generate the required values, the goal is unreachable.
           
           I conclude that, due to the restrictions on available actions, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is not achievable from the initial state provided.
