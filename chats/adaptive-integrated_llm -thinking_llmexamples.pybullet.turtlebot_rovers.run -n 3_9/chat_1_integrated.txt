           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **The Path to New Knowledge**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunctive goal involving image acquisition and analysis. I've analyzed the problem, identifying what needs to be accomplished: I need to get images of three objects (v17, v18, and v19) and perform analysis on two rock samples (v3 and v7).
           
           The initial state reveals a key point: some goals are already met, specifically `atconf` and `free` predicates. This narrows my focus. My main challenges revolve around the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. I can satisfy `receivedimage` by executing `take_image`, and I can satisfy `receivedanalysis` by sending the result of `sample_rock`.
           
           Since I can leverage v14, it becomes my primary rover. I've identified the actions that lead to those goals. My approach involves a series of steps: navigating the rover to a position (`#o3`) where it has a clear view of the three image targets, imaging those targets, then repositioning the rover to another point (`#o0`) to transmit the data. After that, I will sample both `v3` and `v7`, which are rocks, and send the analysis. For sampling, I'll direct the rover to `#o5`, where rocks v3 and v7 are situated.
           
           The prompt requires I determine the continuous values. I see some important predicates. Specifically, I'll need to define three coordinates for these tasks: `#o3` for imaging, `#o0` for transmission, and `#o5` for sampling. The problem indicates that I need a *unique* location for each task: `#o3` for imagevisible, `#o0` for comvisible, and `#o5` for the `above` predicate, given the conditions.
           
           Now, calculating these continuous values becomes crucial. I will focus my efforts to solve for `x` and `y` for these continuous parameters, by examining the geometry for these values. It's a combination of spatial reasoning, where I have to choose a location that can handle the specific tasks. After a careful assessment, my plan will be:
           
           **Rover v14's Plan:**
           
           1.  **Move to Imaging ( #o3)**: (-0.636, 1.0)
           2.  Take Images (using the same ray, which is implied by the setup).
           3.  **Move to Communications ( #o0)**: (-1.5, -1.0)
           4.  Communicate Image Data
           5.  **Move to Sampling ( #o5)**: (-0.089, -0.355)
           6.  Perform Analysis and Communicate
           7.  Send the analysis.
           This constitutes the plan to achieve the target `new-axiom@0()`

(Thoughts: **Refining the Plan for Success**
           
           Okay, after carefully considering the feedback and the geometry of the scene, I've completely revised my approach to ensure a valid plan. The core problem was trying to find a single configuration for the rover (#o3) that could image all three objectives. That just wasn't feasible given the distances and the location of the obstacle, v20.  So, I'm switching to *distinct* continuous parameters for each image capture, each communication, and each 'above' configuration.
           
           I'm now defining a set of new continuous parameters: #o6, #o7, #o8 for the three image captures. #o9 for the comms, and #o10 and #o11 for the above operations. I've re-calculated each configuration's x,y coordinates to ensure line-of-sight is maintained for image capture, communication is within range (4m), and to avoid the wall obstacle v20 (x=0). They are also reachable and collision-free. I've also double-checked that all the calculated distances for each action are within the required ranges.
           
           The new plan is much more structured: first, multiple moves and image captures, then a move to communicate and send images, and finally sample and analyze rocks. The `drop_rock` action is now incorporated, freeing up storage for multiple soil samples as previously requested. The `motion` predicates seem general enough to handle these new continuous parameters. I've also double-checked that all the new coordinates are collision-free. Let's hope this works!

(Thoughts: **Revisiting the Plan: Mastering Continuous Parameters**
           
           Okay, so the main constraint here is that I can only use the continuous configurations already provided (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`) in the `conf` predicates. My past failures were because I generated new, invalid ones.  I have to leverage the information encoded in the initial state predicates and the valid action list. I need to make sure my chosen (#x, #y) configurations satisfy line-of-sight and reachability without collision with obstacles.
           
           The system is designed so that I have to use *pre-defined configurations*, and all the objects that start with "#" and are already specified as `conf(v, #name)` *must* have their coordinate values provided.
           In this case, the continuous parameters `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` are already defined for the rovers. I can't invent new ones! They appear in *above*, *imagevisible*, and *comvisible* predicates, thus requiring x,y values. Therefore, I must use these given continuous parameters and pick their x and y coordinates.
           
           The setup is:
           -   **Rover at its initial configuration**: `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`
           -   **Rover Storage free**: `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`
           -   **Goal**: receive images for v17, v18, v19 and analyses for rock and soil
           
           I can't invent new configurations, but I can re-evaluate the reachability and collision of these configurations. I previously failed because the coordinate values I picked before were wrong. The error messages indicated collisions, so this time I have to pick configuration values that avoid those collisions and make sure it is reachable based on the given predicates.
           
           The main obstacle is `v20`, a wall at `x=0`. To avoid collisions with the rover base, I need to place `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` on the left side of the wall.
           
           So let's choose these coordinate values:
           
           -   `#o3` (for imaging): `(-1.0, 1.0)`. This allows `v14` to see v17, v18, and v19, assuming ray `#o4` goes around the wall, and the given `imagevisible` predicates are valid. The range `imageable(v14, #o3, v17)` must satisfy requirements for being within the image sensor range. I will assume this coordinate is within sensor range, and all image sensor and camera requirements are taken care of by the planners and the given predicates. The coordinate `(-1.0, 1.0)` is to the left of `v20`, the wall at x=0, and reasonably positioned to capture all images.
           -   `#o0` (for communication): `(-1.0, -1.75)` which is the initial position v15, within range of the lander `v9`. This ensures communication and avoids collision.
           -   `#o5` (for sampling): `(-1.0, -0.5)`. This assumes a very long sampling arm or an opening in `v20` to reach both `v3` and `v7`, or `above(v14, #o5, v3)` and `above(v14, #o5, v7)` are defined such that the arm of the rover can reach each object.
           
           These configurations are all to the left of the obstacle, so the base is collision-free and they are all reachable from each other, in the range of the Rover's sensors, and within the constraints provided.
           
           The updated plan is:
           
           1.  **Imaging and Sending Images**:
               *   Move from `v15` to `#o3 = (-1.0, 1.0)`.
               *   Calibrate and take image v17, v18, and v19 (camera is uncalibrated after `take_image`, the calibrate action is needed before taking the image).
               *   Move from `#o3` to `#o0 = (-1.0, -1.75)`.
               *   Send the images.
           2.  **Sampling and Sending Analyses**:
               *   Move from `#o0` to `#o5 = (-1.0, -0.5)`.
               *   Sample rock `v3`.
               *   Drop rock `v3` for freeing the storage.
               *   Sample soil `v7`.
               *   Move from `#o5` to `#o0`.

           -   `#o0` (for communication): `(-1.0, -1.75)` which is the initial position v15, within range of the lander `v9`. This ensures communication and avoids collision.

(Thoughts: **Revised Strategy for Rover Task Completion**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. I've been wrestling with the "not reachable" issue.  It's clear I can't just pick any coordinates for those `#o` positions.  The key is that the system already has some initial configurations and actions defined, and I must work *within* those limitations. I've re-analyzed everything, especially the wall and those pesky "blocked" rays, and I think I've cracked it.
           
           **The Challenges:**
           
           *   I originally assumed the wall (`v20`) was a complete barrier.  This *isn't* the case. While the wall restricts motion directly, the initial state *allows* the rover to see and interact with objects on either side, which suggests rays can cross it. This means the problem isn't necessarily about collisions.
           *   The "not reachable" errors are likely tied to the *specific* coordinates I'm providing.  The system has built-in motion planners, and it's rejecting my initial coordinates because they aren't *compatible* with those motion planners.  I have to find coordinates that are both valid for the task and also *reachable*.
           *   The system includes motion actions that define valid moves, but there's a problem of translating the problem statement to actual robot actions, and the definition of a collision-free motion is critical.
           
           **The Solution:**
           
           Here's my approach:
           
           1.  **Exploit the initial state** - the starting position `v15` at `(-1.0, -1.75)` means if I define `#o0 = (-1.0, -1.75)`, no movement is needed, so that must be *reachable*. So, use `(-1.0, -1.75)` for `#o0` to save communication.
           2.  **Wall-aware locations** - The key is to select specific locations for `#o3` (for imaging) and `#o5` (for sampling) *just outside* the obstacle (`v20`). This means picking coordinates that let `v14` move to the targets without violating line of sight or other constraints.
           3.  **Coordination** - If I place `(-0.2, 1.5)` for `#o3`, this should work well for imaging targets `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`. I've carefully calculated the distances, and it's within range for the camera. Furthermore, if I put `(0.2, -0.5)` as `#o5`, the rover will be above targets `v3` and `v7`. The movement is possible, since `v14` will cross the wall during the motion and thus the coordinate definition means line of sight, and the "reachable for robot base" is satisfied.
           4. **Execution plan:**
            * Move to `#o3 = (-0.2, 1.5)` (image)
            *  Take image of `v17`
            *  Take image of `v18`
            *  Take image of `v19`
            *  Move to `#o0 = (-1.0, -1.75)` (comms)
            *  Send images
            *  Move to `#o5 = (0.2, -0.5)` (sampling)
            *  Sample v3
            *  Drop the sampled material
            *  Sample v7
            *  Move to `#o0 = (-1.0, -1.75)` (comms)
            *  Send analysis
           5. **Justification**
            * These actions all conform to the problem restrictions.
            * Coordinates are not blocked and are within distance for the tasks.
           
           This is the only reasonable way to complete the mission within the defined constraints. I believe this will get the rover to meet all requirements and overcome the pesky "not reachable" error!

Model:     **Revised Strategy for Rover Task Completion**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. I've been wrestling with the "not reachable" issue.  It's clear I can't just pick any coordinates for those `#o` positions.  The key is that the system already has some initial configurations and actions defined, and I must work *within* those limitations. I've re-analyzed everything, especially the wall and those pesky "blocked" rays, and I think I've cracked it.
           
           **The Challenges:**
           
           *   I originally assumed the wall (`v20`) was a complete barrier.  This *isn't* the case. While the wall restricts motion directly, the initial state *allows* the rover to see and interact with objects on either side, which suggests rays can cross it. This means the problem isn't necessarily about collisions.
           *   The "not reachable" errors are likely tied to the *specific* coordinates I'm providing.  The system has built-in motion planners, and it's rejecting my initial coordinates because they aren't *compatible* with those motion planners.  I have to find coordinates that are both valid for the task and also *reachable*.
           *   The system includes motion actions that define valid moves, but there's a problem of translating the problem statement to actual robot actions, and the definition of a collision-free motion is critical.
           
           **The Solution:**
           
           Here's my approach:
           
           1.  **Exploit the initial state** - the starting position `v15` at `(-1.0, -1.75)` means if I define `#o0 = (-1.0, -1.75)`, no movement is needed, so that must be *reachable*. So, use `(-1.0, -1.75)` for `#o0` to save communication.

            *  Take image of `v19`
            *  Move to `#o0 = (-1.0, -1.75)` (comms)
            *  Send images
            *  Move to `#o5 = (0.2, -0.5)` (sampling)
            *  Sample v3

(Thoughts: **My Strategic Repositioning for Rover v14: A Collision-Free and Achievable Plan**
           
           Okay, so the feedback is in, and it's clear the previous configurations for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` were causing issues. My goal is to ensure rover `v14` can complete its tasks without running into `v20`, the pesky wall at x=0. We're dealing with very specific object definitions and, critically, only these three continuous object placeholders: `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`. I'm going to carefully assign coordinates to each of these to avoid both collisions and this "not reachable" error. The rover's base is assumed to be a point or small circle of radius 0.1m
           
           First, I need a safe imaging location `#o3`.  To get a clear shot of objects `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`, which are on both sides of the wall, I've got to find a sweet spot where the rover can "see" past the obstacle. Since `(-0.2, 1.5)` led to a collision, I'm thinking a position well left of the wall will work best -  `(-0.5, 1.0)`. This position is collision-free and should give a clear view.
           
           Next up, communication, which is all about `#o0`.  The lander `v9` is lurking left of the wall. To avoid the reported "not reachable" error associated with the rover's initial position, I'm setting a *different* but still useful position for sending images, `(-1.5, -1.5)`. The provided "motion" primitives do allow movement from v15 to #o0.
           
           Finally, we're talking about `#o5`, where the rover can sample rocks. Because there is an "above" initial predicate, the rover arm *must* be capable of reaching. I'm choosing `(-0.5, -0.5)` because it gives us good access to rock `v7`, and it should be well within the rover's arm reach.
           
           Now, a very crucial assumption: that the existing motion primitives allow *moving to* these newly assigned coordinate positions:
           - `v15` to `#o3`: motion exists.
           - `#o3` to `#o0`: motion exists.
           - `#o0` to `#o5`: motion exists.
           - `#o5` to `#o0`: motion exists.
           
           Let's do a final safety check:  The plan for `v14` now is clear. We're moving from a pre-defined point or circle on the left, to our carefully calculated (#o0, #o3, #o5) and back to #o0.
