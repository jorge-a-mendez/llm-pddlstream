           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single square surface centered at the origin, with extents from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y directions. The object is also square, with side length 0.09013453369037294. I need to find 50 stable placements for this object on the surface. Since both the surface and object are square, any orientation will be stable as long as the object is within the surface boundaries.
           
           The half-extent of the object is 0.09013453369037294 / 2 = 0.04506726684518647.
           The half-extent of the surface is 0.135.
           The maximum x and y coordinates for the center of the object will be 0.135 - 0.04506726684518647 = 0.08993273315481353.
           The minimum x and y coordinates for the center of the object will be -0.08993273315481353.
           I will generate placements by varying x, y, and theta within these bounds.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene remains the same: a single square surface centered at the origin, with extents from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y directions.
           A new object (ID: 5) is introduced, which is also square with side length 0.09641084075238132.
           I also know that object ID 8 was successfully placed at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). This means object 8 is centered at the origin. Its half-extent is 0.09013453369037294 / 2 = 0.04506726684518647. So object 8 occupies the space from approximately -0.045 to 0.045 in both x and y.
           
           The new object (ID: 5) has a half-extent of 0.09641084075238132 / 2 = 0.04820542037619066.
           The maximum valid center coordinate for object 5 on surface 0 (without considering other objects) is 0.135 - 0.04820542037619066 = 0.08679457962380934.
           The minimum valid center coordinate is -0.08679457962380934.
           
           I need to place object 5 such that it does not collide with object 8. Object 8 is at (0, 0, 0).
           The bounding box for object 8 is `(-0.04506726684518647, -0.04506726684518647)` to `(0.04506726684518647, 0.04506726684518647)`.
           To avoid collision, the bounding box of object 5 must not overlap with object 8.
           Since both objects are square, I can place object 5 directly adjacent to object 8 along one of the axes.
           For example, if I place object 5 to the right of object 8, its left edge must be at x > 0.04506726684518647.
           The center of object 5 would then be at x = 0.04506726684518647 + 0.04820542037619066 = 0.09327268722137713.
           However, this center x (0.09327) is greater than the maximum allowed center (0.08679). This means that placing it directly adjacent along one axis, without any overlap, makes it go outside the surface. This implies that the objects are too large to be placed side-by-side without overlap on this surface.
           
           Therefore, for ID 5 to be stable and not collide with ID 8, it must be placed *over* or *under* ID 8. Since this is a 2D placement, this means that they must overlap in x-y projection. This indicates that the problem implicitly expects that objects can stack, or that my previous assumption about ID 8 being a fixed obstacle is wrong, and it could be moved by the simulation. However, the problem statement says "collide with any of the fixed obstacles", so object 8 is not a fixed obstacle. The previous successful placement of object 8 means it is now present in the scene, and I need to avoid colliding with it. Since direct side-by-side placement is not possible without exceeding surface bounds, I need to place object 5 in a way that minimizes overlap with object 8, or explores a different strategy entirely if overlapping is considered collision.
           
           The prompt states: "If you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene." This is not the same object, but a new object. However, the rule "avoid collision between objects i and j" for objects with different IDs is important.
           
           Given the constraints, it's impossible to place object 5 on surface 0 without its bounding box overlapping with object 8's bounding box AND remaining fully on surface 0.
           This could mean:
           1. The definition of "collision" for non-fixed objects is more nuanced than simple AABB overlap.
           2. The problem setters intend for me to find a placement that *would* be stable if object 8 were not there, and let the simulation figure it out.
           3. My understanding of the interaction between previously placed objects and new objects is incomplete for this specific scenario.
           
           However, the problem statement explicitly says "you must avoid collision between objects i and j". Given the dimensions, this means I cannot place object 5 without its AABB overlapping with object 8's AABB while both are fully on surface 0.
           
           Let's re-read carefully: "If you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j."
           This is a hard constraint.
           Let object 8's BBOX be `B8 = ((-0.045067, -0.045067), (0.045067, 0.045067))`.
           Let object 5's half-extent be `h5 = 0.048205`.
           Let surface 0's half-extent be `S0 = 0.135`.
           If I place object 5's center at `(x5, y5)`, its BBOX is `((x5-h5, y5-h5), (x5+h5, y5+h5))`.
           For object 5 to be on surface 0: `abs(x5) + h5 <= S0` and `abs(y5) + h5 <= S0`.
           So `abs(x5) <= S0 - h5 = 0.135 - 0.048205 = 0.086795`.
           And `abs(y5) <= S0 - h5 = 0.086795`.
           
           If I try to place object 5 to the right of object 8, the left edge of object 5 must be to the right of the right edge of object 8.
           `x5 - h5 > 0.045067`
           `x5 > 0.045067 + h5 = 0.045067 + 0.048205 = 0.093272`.
           This `x5 = 0.093272` is greater than `0.086795`, meaning this placement is out of bounds for surface 0.
           The same applies for placing it to the left, top, or bottom of object 8.
           This implies it is geometrically impossible to place object 5 on surface 0 without colliding with object 8, given the AABB collision definition and the surface bounds.
           
           However, I "never give up". The problem setters might have a different definition of collision or stacking.
           Since I must provide 50 placements, I will try placing object 5 in positions that are as far as possible from object 8's center while still being on the surface. These positions will necessarily overlap with object 8's AABB. This might be a scenario where objects are allowed to stack if their centers are different, or the simulation has a different collision model.
           
           I will try placing object 5 as close to the corners of the surface as possible, or against the edges, to minimize its overlap with the center (where object 8 is). Since the prompt doesn't specify how collision with previously placed objects is handled in 2D (e.g., if one object is "above" another), I will assume the prompt implies that the 2D bounding boxes should not overlap. If it's truly impossible, then no valid placement can be given. But since I must provide 50, I will generate placements that are within the surface bounds and see which ones are accepted.
           
           I will prioritize placements that are furthest from the center (0,0) where object 8 is located.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene is still a single square surface (0) from -0.135 to 0.135 in x and y.
           I now have two previously placed objects:
           Object ID 8: center (0, 0), half-extent 0.04506726684518647. BBOX: `((-0.045067, -0.045067), (0.045067, 0.045067))`.
           Object ID 5: center (0.086, 0.086), half-extent 0.04820542037619066. BBOX: `((0.086-0.048205, 0.086-0.048205), (0.086+0.048205, 0.086+0.048205))` which is `((0.037795, 0.037795), (0.134205, 0.134205))`. This placement for object 5 just barely fits within the surface (max 0.135).
           
           A new object (ID: 4) is introduced, which is also square with side length 0.08866461521627828.
           Its half-extent is 0.08866461521627828 / 2 = 0.04433230760813914.
           The maximum valid center coordinate for object 4 on surface 0 is 0.135 - 0.04433230760813914 = 0.09066769239186086.
           The minimum valid center coordinate is -0.09066769239186086.
           
           I need to place object 4 without colliding with object 8 and object 5.
           Let's check the existing objects' bounding boxes:
           BBOX for object 8: `((-0.045067, -0.045067), (0.045067, 0.045067))`
           BBOX for object 5: `((0.037795, 0.037795), (0.134205, 0.134205))`
           
           Notice the overlap between BBOX 8 and BBOX 5 in the previous successful placement.
           Object 8's upper-right corner is (0.045067, 0.045067).
           Object 5's lower-left corner is (0.037795, 0.037795).
           There is an overlap region from (0.037795, 0.037795) to (0.045067, 0.045067).
           This confirms my earlier suspicion that "avoid collision between objects i and j" doesn't strictly mean AABB non-overlap in the 2D plane as I first interpreted for rigid 2D objects. It implies that either:
           1. Objects can partially overlap or stack in some way not fully described by 2D AABB.
           2. The collision check is more nuanced (e.g., center-point distance, or a specific stacking mechanism).
           3. The "successes" are simply "no collision with fixed obstacles" and *do not guarantee no collision between non-fixed objects*. However, the instruction "you must avoid collision between objects i and j" suggests I *should* avoid it.
           
           Given that two objects with overlapping AABBs were successfully placed, I must adjust my understanding of "collision" for non-fixed objects. It seems a central overlap is usually what is avoided, or perhaps a large overlap. The successful placement of object 5 places it in the upper-right corner, somewhat avoiding the center where object 8 is.
           
           The problem states "if a placement fails multiple times, it is likely that there is a collision that you are not aware of". This implies I need to use the feedback to learn. The previous success with overlap means I can't treat AABB overlap as a definite collision. I will assume that placements that are sufficiently "far apart" or that place an object in a "corner" or "edge" are more likely to succeed.
           
           Object 4's half-extent is `h4 = 0.044332`.
           Max center coordinates: `0.090668`.
           
           I will try to place object 4 in the other corners or edges, maintaining some distance from the centers of objects 8 and 5 if possible, but also trying to occupy parts of the surface that aren't 'dominated' by the others. Since (0.086, 0.086) is occupied by object 5, I will try the other three corners.
           Let's analyze the available space.
           Surface 0: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`
           Object 8 BBOX: `((-0.045, -0.045), (0.045, 0.045))`
           Object 5 BBOX: `((0.038, 0.038), (0.134, 0.134))`
           
           Available quadrants/regions:
           - Top-left: `x < 0`, `y > 0`
           - Bottom-left: `x < 0`, `y < 0`
           - Bottom-right: `x > 0`, `y < 0`
           
           The region around `(0,0)` is occupied by object 8. The top-right `(0.086, 0.086)` region is occupied by object 5.
           I will try to place object 4 in the other three corners, at the maximum valid x/y coordinates.
           
           Max center for ID 4: `0.090`.

Model:     The scene is still a single square surface (0) from -0.135 to 0.135 in x and y.
           I now have three previously placed objects:
           Object ID 8: center (0, 0), half-extent 0.04506726684518647. BBOX: `((-0.045067, -0.045067), (0.045067, 0.045067))`.
           Object ID 5: center (0.086, 0.086), half-extent 0.04820542037619066. BBOX: `((0.037795, 0.037795), (0.134205, 0.134205))`.
           Object ID 4: center (-0.07, 0.07), half-extent 0.04433230760813914. BBOX: `((-0.114332, 0.025668), (-0.025668, 0.114332))`.
           
           I also received negative feedback for object 4:
           Placements with rotation 0.7853981633974483 (45 degrees) and center at -0.090, 0.090 (and other corners) were not stable because the AABB of the rotated object went out of bounds. This is important: when an object is rotated, its axis-aligned bounding box expands.
           For a square object with side `s`, when rotated by 45 degrees, the new effective side length of its AABB is `s * sqrt(2)`.
           For object 4, side `s = 0.08866461521627828`. Its half-extent is `h4 = 0.04433230760813914`.
           When rotated by 45 degrees, the effective half-extent of its AABB becomes `h4_rotated = h4 * sqrt(2) = 0.04433230760813914 * 1.41421356237 = 0.0626993134919574`.
           The maximum center for object 4, when rotated by 45 degrees, would be `0.135 - 0.0626993134919574 = 0.0723006865080426`.
           My previous placements used `0.090` for the center, which is indeed outside this new bound, hence the instability.
           This means I must be more careful with rotations. For square objects, 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees (0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2 radians) do not change the AABB. Any other angle will increase the AABB size. For small objects or large surfaces, this is often fine, but for objects close to the surface boundary, it's critical.
           
           A new object (ID: 7) is introduced, which is also square with side length 0.0948403698861377.
           Its half-extent is `h7 = 0.0948403698861377 / 2 = 0.04742018494306885`.
           The maximum valid center coordinate for object 7 on surface 0 (without rotation) is `S0 - h7 = 0.135 - 0.04742018494306885 = 0.08757981505693115`.
           Let's round this to `0.087`.
           
           If rotated by 45 degrees, the effective half-extent `h7_rotated = h7 * sqrt(2) = 0.04742018494306885 * 1.41421356237 = 0.0670557404456577`.
           The maximum valid center coordinate for object 7 when rotated by 45 degrees would be `0.135 - 0.0670557404456577 = 0.0679442595543423`.
           Let's round this to `0.067`.
           
           Current placed objects BBOXes:
           BBOX 8: `((-0.045067, -0.045067), (0.045067, 0.045067))`
           BBOX 5: `((0.037795, 0.037795), (0.134205, 0.134205))` (center 0.086, 0.086)
           BBOX 4: `((-0.114332, 0.025668), (-0.025668, 0.114332))` (center -0.07, 0.07)
           
           I need to find 50 placements for object 7 without colliding with 8, 5, and 4.
           The successful placements (8, 5, 4) show that significant AABB overlap is allowed. Object 8 is at (0,0), object 5 is at (0.086, 0.086) (top-right-ish), and object 4 is at (-0.07, 0.07) (top-left-ish).
           
           This leaves the bottom-left and bottom-right corners relatively free, as well as the bottom edge. The central region is heavily covered.
           Let's try to place object 7 in the bottom-right and bottom-left corners, and along the bottom edge. Also, places near the center but shifted.
           
           Max center for ID 7 (no rotation): `0.087`.
           Max center for ID 7 (45 deg rotation): `0.067`.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene is still a single square surface (0) from -0.135 to 0.135 in x and y.
           I now have four previously placed objects:
           Object ID 8: center (0, 0), half-extent 0.04506726684518647. BBOX: `((-0.045067, -0.045067), (0.045067, 0.045067))`.
           Object ID 5: center (0.086, 0.086), half-extent 0.04820542037619066. BBOX: `((0.037795, 0.037795), (0.134205, 0.134205))`.
           Object ID 4: center (-0.07, 0.07), half-extent 0.04433230760813914. BBOX: `((-0.114332, 0.025668), (-0.025668, 0.114332))`.
           Object ID 7: center (0.07, -0.07), half-extent 0.04742018494306885. BBOX: `((0.022580, -0.117420), (0.117420, -0.022580))`.
           
           The previous negative feedback for object 4 regarding 45-degree rotations exceeding surface bounds is confirmed. I must be careful with rotated placements near the edges.
           
           A new object (ID: 6) is introduced, which is also square with side length 0.08090145903965551.
           Its half-extent is `h6 = 0.08090145903965551 / 2 = 0.040450729519827755`.
           The maximum valid center coordinate for object 6 on surface 0 (without rotation) is `S0 - h6 = 0.135 - 0.040450729519827755 = 0.09454927048017224`.
           Let's round this to `0.094`.
           
           If rotated by 45 degrees, the effective half-extent `h6_rotated = h6 * sqrt(2) = 0.040450729519827755 * 1.41421356237 = 0.05721111005177659`.
           The maximum valid center coordinate for object 6 when rotated by 45 degrees would be `0.135 - 0.05721111005177659 = 0.07778888994822341`.
           Let's round this to `0.077`.
           
           Current placed objects BBOXes:
           BBOX 8: `((-0.045, -0.045), (0.045, 0.045))` (center 0,0)
           BBOX 5: `((0.038, 0.038), (0.134, 0.134))` (center 0.086, 0.086) - top-right
           BBOX 4: `((-0.114, 0.026), (-0.026, 0.114))` (center -0.07, 0.07) - top-left
           BBOX 7: `((0.023, -0.117), (0.117, -0.023))` (center 0.07, -0.07) - bottom-right
           
           The bottom-left corner and regions along the left and bottom edges are still relatively "less occupied" by the edges of the existing objects. The center is very busy. The three successful placements (5, 4, 7) are in three of the four quadrants (top-right, top-left, bottom-right), specifically towards the corners, while 8 is at the origin.
           This implies there's a strong preference for placing new objects in the remaining "empty" corner.
           
           I will try placing object 6 primarily in the bottom-left corner and along the bottom/left edges. I'll also try a few central placements to confirm my understanding of the overlap rules.
           
           Max center for ID 6 (no rotation): `0.094`.
           Max center for ID 6 (45 deg rotation): `0.077`.
