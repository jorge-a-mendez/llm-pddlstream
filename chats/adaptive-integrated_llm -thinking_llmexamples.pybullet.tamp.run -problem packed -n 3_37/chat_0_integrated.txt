User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.109, 0.294, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.997, 0.074).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.069, 0.254), (0.148, 0.334)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.038, 0.421, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.668, 0.744).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.244, 0.52, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.973, -0.229).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.077, 0.383), (0.0, 0.46)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.197, 0.473), (0.291, 0.567)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom stackable(v14, v16)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom supported(v14, v15, v11)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom atpose(v14, v15)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom stackable(v14, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)

           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Action Limitations**
           
           My objective is to achieve the goal of placing objects v8, v12, and v14 onto object v16.  This translates to ensuring `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)` are true. Currently, these three objects are on v11, supported by their corresponding poses.  v16 is the designated target surface.
           
           I've determined that `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are indeed stackable on v16, as indicated by the `stackable` predicate. My initial plan involved picking up each object from its current pose and placing it onto v16 at a new pose.  I'd use my two arms, `v4` and `v6`, which are currently handempty, to execute these pick and place actions.  The general strategy: Pick, then Place.
           
           Let's focus on v8 as an example. To achieve `on(v8, v16)`, I need `supported(v8, ?p, v16)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)`. Given the initial state, I see I should place v8 onto pose `#o2` on v16. Picking up v8 would involve a kin predicate `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, ?q, ?t)`. I would need to find the specific values for the trajectory for both pick and place. Similarly, the place operation would require kin: `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, ?q', ?t')`.
           
           However, here's where the problem arises: the only allowed action instance I've been given is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. The task specifies that *only* the actions listed are allowed.  No pick or place actions are listed.  Pick and place are what I need to move the objects to v16.
           
           The implications are severe.  Without the ability to actually *pick* up and *place* objects (which the action instances do not have), the goal is fundamentally unachievable. The robot's base is also fixed at a location, `v3`, based on the current action constraint.
           
           Given the constraints outlined in the problem, specifically the limitation of action instances, I must conclude that the requested goal is unreachable.
