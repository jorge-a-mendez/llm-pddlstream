User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.077, 0.383), (0.0, 0.46)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.069, 0.254), (0.148, 0.334)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.038, 0.421, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.668, 0.744).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.197, 0.473), (0.291, 0.567)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.109, 0.294, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.997, 0.074).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.244, 0.52, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.973, -0.229).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **Planning to Stack Objects**
           
           My objective is to place the three objects—`v8`, `v12`, and `v14`—onto the surface `v16`. Currently, they are all resting on `v11`.  The task calls for moving them one by one.  I'll need to use arm `v4` since the initial state lists `kin` predicates specifically for `v4`.  I have an initial base configuration `v3` for which `atbconf(v3)` is true, and the robot doesn't need to move its base. Since the robot is initially handempty and all the preconditions for `pick` are satisfied for `v8` (`handempty(v4)`, `atbconf(v3)`, and the `kin` predicates for arm `v4`), I can `pick` each object in turn.  Once picked, I must place each object onto `v16`, which will involve the `supported` predicate—specifically to meet the goal requirement `on(?, v16)`.  The plan is simple: `pick` then `place`, repeated for each object.
           
           To place an object, I'll need a new pose on `v16` for each object. For `v8`, `v12` and `v14`, I will pick a collision-free pose for each one on `v16`—making sure the new placements don't overlap. Since all objects have the same grasp and bconf in the initial state, I'll use the same grasp and bconf for each placement and then assign specific continuous values to the poses of each object on the surface `v16` since the instruction says "If the plan requires multiple different objects to be placed simultaneously at the same pose starting with '#', then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* object at that pose." I have to ensure the placements are collision-free. I will use the `--Poses--` section for this.
           
           I'll choose the following plan:
           1.  **Pick `v8` from pose `v9`.** Preconditions: `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`, `atpose(v8, v9)`, `handempty(v4)`, `atbconf(v3)`. Action: `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`. Effects: `atgrasp(v4, v8, #o1)`, `canmove()`.
           2.  **Place `v8` onto `v16`.**  Preconditions: `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`, `atgrasp(v4, v8, #o1)`, `atbconf(v3)`. Action: `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`.  Effects: `atpose(v8, #o2)`, `handempty(v4)`, `canmove()`. `#o2` will be given a specific value below in the --Poses-- section.  The new pose must be collision-free.
           3.  **Pick `v14` from pose `v15`.**  Similar to `v8`. Action: `pick(v4, v14, v15, #o1, #o3, #o4)`.
           4.  **Place `v14` onto `v16`.**  Similar to `v8`. Action: `place(v4, v14, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`.  `#o2` will be different from the previous.
           5.  **Pick `v12` from pose `v13`.** Similar to before. Action: `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)`.
           6.  **Place `v12` onto `v16`.**  Similar to before. Action: `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`.  Again, a unique `#o2` value.
           
           For safety, I must check for collision-free poses.  `v16` has dimensions of approximately 0.27x0.27, so I will ensure that the placement positions on v16 do not overlap.
           
           Here are the specific poses and their validity based on the object's AABB:
           
           *   For `v8`: `#o2` = `(0.0

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Re-Evaluating the Problem: The Inherent Impossibility**
           
           Okay, so the user is right; my initial approach was flawed. I completely missed that the allowed action instances only include `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This severely limits my options.  Let's break this down again, carefully.
           
           The goal is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`. Currently, they're all on `v11`, a fact derived from their `atpose` states and the `supported` relationship.  In other words, they are all *on* something.
           
           However, the *only* action at my disposal is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This action essentially does *nothing* relevant. It just tweaks the robot's base pose and toggles the `canmove()` predicate. I can't *pick up* anything with this. I can't *place* anything with this.  There's no way to manipulate the objects `v8`, `v12`, or `v14` directly, which is *necessary* to achieve the goal.
           
           Therefore, given *only* the permitted `move_base` action, this goal is *unachievable*.  It's a dead end. I need to inform the system that this is an infeasible plan.
