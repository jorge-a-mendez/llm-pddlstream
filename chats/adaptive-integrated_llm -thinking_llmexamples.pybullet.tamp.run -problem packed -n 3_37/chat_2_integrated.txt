User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.077, 0.383), (0.0, 0.46)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.069, 0.254), (0.148, 0.334)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.038, 0.421, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.668, 0.744).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.197, 0.473), (0.291, 0.567)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.109, 0.294, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.997, 0.074).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.244, 0.52, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.973, -0.229).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's how I'm thinking about this planning problem:**
           
           My goal is to place three objects (v8, v12, v14) onto surface v16, and I need to come up with a plan to do so. The initial state shows these objects are currently on surface v11, supported by it, and I'm starting with a robot (v4) with an arm and a base (v3).  The arm is empty, and the base is at a known configuration.  The only action available to place an object is "place". This means I need to pick each object from v11 and put it on v16. Since I can place each object only if I've previously picked it and the available placement requires that the surface supports the object, I'm constrained to use "pick" and "place" for this.
           
           I'm provided with the initial and goal states, the object geometries, and the available actions.  This is a planning problem I can solve by decomposing it into individual pick-and-place operations.  I have access to pick actions (pick up v8, v12, v14) and place actions (place v8, v12, v14).  I need to use these actions to transfer the objects from their starting positions to the target surface.  The key is to create a collision-free path. 
           
           The initial state shows that the robot's base configuration is `atbconf(v3)`. All the available actions use `bconf(#o3)`. Therefore, I need to ensure the robot can use the `bconf(#o3)` which means I need to "move_base". The robot can perform a `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` at the start to go from `atbconf(v3)` to `atbconf(#o3)`.
           
           The plan:
           1.  Move the base using `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`. The cost of this action is a distance.
           2.  Pick v8.
           3.  Place v8 onto v16 at position #o2.
           4.  Pick v12.
           5.  Place v12 onto v16 at #o2 (but a different #o2).
           6.  Pick v14.
           7.  Place v14 onto v16 at #o2 (again, different #o2).
           
           The crucial aspect for "place" is figuring out what value the #o2 parameter takes for each object, as #o2 is the pose for `v8`, `v12`, `v14`.  I need to provide continuous values for #o2 that represent collision-free stable placements for each object on v16.  This is based on the problem instruction.
           
           I'll choose the positions on v16 such that they're all within the available area, and roughly distributed and separated.  I need to specify each object's target pose on v16, ensuring that I maintain the same height. I will generate the parameters for #o2 based on the dimensions of the objects. Since the v16 AABB's center is at 0, I chose a placement relative to the center.
           
           The only remaining question is what value to assign to `#o3`. Based on the instruction and the fact that `move_base` action involves the `distance`, it is assumed that the robot's base configuration does not change and that `#o3` is equal to `v3`, to minimize the cost. I don't need to specify this.
           
           The cost will be the total number of actions (3 picks + 3 places) plus the distance between the two configurations: 6 + distance(v3, #o3). Since `#o3` should be `v3`, the distance is assumed to be 0. Thus the costs is 6.  The `kin` functions help with trajectory generation for each pick and place by giving us `#o4`.
