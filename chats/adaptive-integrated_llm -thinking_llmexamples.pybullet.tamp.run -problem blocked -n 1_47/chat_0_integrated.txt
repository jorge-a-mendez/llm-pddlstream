User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object

           v8: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.489, 0.419), (-4.394, 0.514)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.441, 0.466, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.516, 0.857).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom graspable(v15)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v14)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom stackable(v12, v18)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom type(v12, v17)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom pose(v15, v16)
           Atom stackable(v15, v10)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)
           Atom type(v8, v17)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom stackable(v8, v18)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachability Analysis**
           
           Okay, here's what I've figured out. My primary goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which expands to establishing `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. The initial state provides that `type(v12, v17)` and `type(v8, v17)` are true. This means either `v12` or `v8` could be `?green`.
           
           To satisfy `on(?green, v18)`, I need to ensure `supported(?green, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(?green, ?p)`.  I can see that `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` is true. This means, if `atpose(v12, #o2)` is true, I'd achieve my goal for `v12`. But `v12` is currently at `atpose(v12, v13)`.
           
           My plan, in a perfect world, would involve picking `v12` from `v13` and placing it at `#o2`. The same logic holds for `v8`. The problem is that the only allowed action instance is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. No `pick` or `place` instances are available, and thus, I cannot manipulate the `atpose` of any object. Given that, with only the ability to move my base, I can't place either `v12` or `v8` onto `v18`.
           
           I've carefully reread the problem description: any actions not in the provided instance list are strictly forbidden. Since I can't physically place an object, achieving `on(?green, v18)` is impossible. No axiom magically provides a way to infer `on` without the proper `supported` and `atpose` predicates. In conclusion, given the current limitations, the goal is simply unreachable.
