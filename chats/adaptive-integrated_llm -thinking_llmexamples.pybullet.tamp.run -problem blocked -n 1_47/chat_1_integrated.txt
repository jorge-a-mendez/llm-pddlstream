User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.489, 0.419), (-4.394, 0.514)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.441, 0.466, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.516, 0.857).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan: I need to figure out how to make `new-axiom@0()` true, which basically means getting an object of type `v17` *on* `v18`. From the given state, I see I can use either `v12` or `v8`. But let's go with `v8` first since it's closer to the goal.
           
           Now, to get `on(v8, v18)`, I need to find a way to make sure it's *supported* and at a specific pose (`#o2`). Looking at what's in my "toolbox" (available predicates), I see both `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` *and* that `v8` has a pose, which is at `v9`.
           
           My current thought is to *pick* `v8` from pose `v9`, and *place* it onto `v18`. That should work. I can use the actions `pick` and `place`, respectively.
           
           To do the picking, I will need to call the predicate `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`. All of the necessary `kin` predicates, `atpose` predicates, and `handempty` predicates exist. As for `atbconf`, I need base config `#o3` (which I assume is `v3` because of my available `move_base` action). In this case, I will have to assume that `#o3` represents `v3` since `atbconf(v3)` is true. If `#o3` is `v3` then everything can work as I stated. The `move_base` action won't do anything, but the preconditions should be met.
           
           And for placing `v8`, I'll use the `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` action. It should fit if I have an existing *kin* predicate for placing the block.
           
           **Finding a Plausible Pose:**
           
           Okay, here's the tricky part: where do I put it? I have these AABB values for the objects. But the prompt is asking me to consider the scene and that there is an existing supported and placement. Because `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is in the initial state, I just need to find a reasonable pose `#o2` for it to work. If I have a valid pose, I can satisfy everything.
           
           Let's assume there is a way to handle the geometries, and I will choose a pose such that the center of `v8` will lie within `v18`'s area. With this, the place is stable.
           I am interpreting the AABBs to be a rough approximation, and not necessarily the full geometric constraints.
           If `v18` has a surface at z = 0.8, then I can compute a correct `z` for the object. The `z` value should be half the object's width (the half height) plus `v18` surface z. So if the object has height 0.07, its center would be 0.835. So, the pose would be `(4.5, -0.3, 0.835, 0.0)`.
           
           **The Final Plan:**
           
           1.  **`pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`:** Pick `v8` from pose `v9`, with base config `#o3` (assumed to be `v3`).
           2.  **`place(v4, v8, (4.5, -0.3, 0.835, 0.0), #o1, #o3, #o4)`:** Place `v8` at the calculated pose `#o2` where its center lies within `v18`'s footprint, thereby achieving `on(v8, v18)`.
           
           The plan satisfies the goal conditions and satisfies the geometric considerations.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm looking at this problem, and the previous plan is a non-starter. The reason is simple: the only action permitted is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. That's essentially a no-op; the robot's base isn't even moving!
           
           The goal is to get something, which could be either `v12` or `v8` based on the initial state, *on* surface `v18`. To achieve that, the plan needs to satisfy the *on* predicate. I know that `on` requires an object to be supported and at a specific pose. From the initial state, I see that both `v12` and `v8` are indeed supported *on* surface `v18`. The challenge is that currently, their poses are not `#o2`, which is what's needed.
           
           The problem is that the only allowed action *can't* change the `atpose` predicate for either object. I need to move an object to a new pose.  I need a `pick` and a `place` action for this. And those aren't permitted.  I could analyze further, but based on the constraints given, the goal is simply unreachable. The provided action, the no-op move, is useless for changing the configuration to meet the goal condition. It's a dead end. Therefore, I can confidently conclude that, given the strict constraints of this turn, the goal cannot be achieved.
