User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The environment is bounded by a square from (-2.5, -2.5) to (2.5, 2.5). There's a central vertical wall at x=0, which seems to divide the space. There are also several smaller rectangular obstacles scattered throughout the scene. Some obstacles are along the outer walls, forming a perimeter.
           The target point is (0.91 1.76). I need to find 3 positions within 2 units of this point. I will try to place the robot in different directions around the target, avoiding the known obstacles, especially the central wall at x=0 and the obstacles near the target like ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)) and ((0.1801, -0.841), (0.318, -0.702)).
           
           Given the target (0.91, 1.76), I can calculate a few candidate points around it, keeping in mind the obstacles.
           The obstacle ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)) is very close to the target, to its left. So, I should avoid placing the robot directly to the left of the target, especially between x=0.25 and x=0.75, if the y is similar.
           The central wall at x=0 means I cannot place the robot on the left side of the wall and view a target on the right side if the target is occluded.
           
           1.  **Position 1: To the right of the target.** (x = 0.91 + 1.5 = 2.41, y = 1.76). This is within the x-limits.
           2.  **Position 2: Below the target, slightly to the right.** (x = 0.91 + 0.5 = 1.41, y = 1.76 - 1.5 = 0.26). This avoids the wall at x=0 and is far from the obstacle ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)).
           3.  **Position 3: To the left and slightly above the target.** (x = 0.91 - 1.5 = -0.59, y = 1.76 + 0.5 = 2.26). This position is to the left of the central wall (x=0). However, the target is at x=0.91. If the central wall is opaque, this position will be occluded. I will try a position to the left of the target but still on the right side of the x=0 wall. For example, x = 0.91 - 0.5 = 0.41, y = 1.76 + 0.5 = 2.26. This is still within range and avoids the obstacle ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)) that is to the left of the target.
               
               Revised Position 3: (x = 0.91 - 0.5 = 0.41, y = 1.76 + 0.5 = 2.26). This is within 2 units of the target (sqrt((0.5)^2 + (0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.25) = sqrt(0.5) approx 0.7). It's also to the right of x=0.
           
           Positions:
           (2.41 1.76)
           (1.41 0.26)
           (0.41 2.26)
