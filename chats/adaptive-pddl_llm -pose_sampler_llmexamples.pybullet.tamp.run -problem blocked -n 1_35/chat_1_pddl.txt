           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v15`. `v8` and `v15` are currently on `v11`, and `v12` is on `v14`. `v8`, `v12` and `v15` are all of `type v17`. The robots have two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both are handempty.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true for some object `?green`. From the initial state, we know that `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`. Therefore, we need to achieve `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           Currently, `v8` is on `v11` (supported(v8, v9, v11) and atpose(v8, v9)). `v12` is on `v14` (supported(v12, v13, v14) and atpose(v12, v13)). To achieve `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)`, we need to pick one of them up and place it on `v18`.
           
           The only allowed action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not change the position of any object, nor does it allow for picking or placing. Therefore, it is impossible to satisfy the goal of moving an object to `v18`.
           
           --Plan--:
           (move_base v3 v3 #o0)

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Fact is not satisfied: Atom new-axiom@0()`. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The previous analysis of the problem revealed that the goal `new-axiom@0()` requires either `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)` to be true, given their types. However, the only available action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` does not allow for picking and placing objects, which is necessary to change their supported surface. Therefore, the goal cannot be achieved with the given actions. Since the only available action is `move_base` with identical start and end configurations, it effectively does nothing to change the state relevant to the goal.
           
           The fact that the previous response was marked as invalid for not achieving the goal, and given the extremely limited set of available actions, confirms that the goal is currently unreachable.
