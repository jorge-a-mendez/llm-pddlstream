           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **The Path to New Axiom: A Rover's Journey**
           
           My goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a complex state change requiring both image acquisition and rock analysis.  Here's how I'll break it down, keeping in mind I'm working with a fleet of rovers and various scientific instruments:
           
           First, I need to understand the initial state. I have two rovers at their respective starting configurations (v12 at v13 and v14 at v15), and their stores are free, perfect! I also have to assume that images from these configs are clear. My plan focuses primarily on Rover 14.
           
           **Phase 1: Image Acquisition and Transmission**
           
           1.  **Preparation is Key:** Rover 14, currently at its starting location, needs to move to a vantage point, designated as configuration `#o3`,  for taking the images, as dictated by `imagevisible`.
           2.  **Calibration:** My camera system on rover 14 needs to be calibrated. For each image, I will first use the `calibrate` action at configuration `#o3`, making sure my lens is adjusted.
           3.  **Image Capture:** I then activate the `take_image` action with `camera 10` for each of my objectives at configuration `#o3` and mode `v11`. I'll capture the images in sequence to the four different objectives needed: v17, v18, v19, and v20, making sure to recalibrate after each image.
           4.  **Send the Pictures:** Once the images are in hand, I’ll move Rover 14 to configuration `#o0`, to prepare to transmit the images to the lander `v9`. This is where `comvisible` comes into play. I'll then use the `send_image` action to transmit the images of the four objectives.
           
           **Phase 2: Rock Analysis**
           
           1.  **Head to the Sample Site:**  Rover 14 will then move to a designated configuration `#o5`, an area where my sensors are above a good cross section of rocks to use my manipulator. This is to gather the needed samples of rocks for analysis and transmit the analysis.
           2.  **Sampling Time:** With Rover 14 in position, I’ll use my manipulator with the `sample_rock` action on the available rock examples: `v1` (stone) and `v5` (soil). At the end of each `sample_rock` call, the store must be full, I have to empty the rocks to allow another.
           3.  **Empty the Stores:** The `drop_rock` action must be executed to remove the rock to prepare for sampling the next sample rock.
           4.  **Communicate:** Once the samples are in the rover’s store, I have to transmit the analysis. The rover will move to configuration `#o0`, to prepare to transmit the analysis to the lander `v9`. The rover will use the `send_analysis` action to transmit the rock analysis.
           5.  **Return to Base:** Lastly, Rover 14, now with its mission complete, will return to its initial configuration `v15`, ensuring that `atconf(v14, v15)` remains true.
           
           This sequence of actions, precisely executed, will ensure that I meet the goal of `new-axiom@0()`, capturing the images and performing the rock analysis. The plan is carefully constructed to ensure that preconditions are respected and that the required intermediate states are achieved. The key is to recognize the connections between actions, and the use of the different configurations needed to complete the tasks.

           **Phase 1: Image Acquisition and Transmission**
           
           1.  **Preparation is Key:** Rover 14, currently at its starting location, needs to move to a vantage point, designated as configuration `#o3`,  for taking the images, as dictated by `imagevisible`.
           2.  **Calibration:** My camera system on rover 14 needs to be calibrated. For each image, I will first use the `calibrate` action at configuration `#o3`, making sure my lens is adjusted.
           3.  **Image Capture:** I then activate the `take_image` action with `camera 10` for each of my objectives at configuration `#o3` and mode `v11`. I'll capture the images in sequence to the four different objectives needed: v17, v18, v19, and v20, making sure to recalibrate after each image.
           4.  **Send the Pictures:** Once the images are in hand, I’ll move Rover 14 to configuration `#o0`, to prepare to transmit the images to the lander `v9`. This is where `comvisible` comes into play. I'll then use the `send_image` action to transmit the images of the four objectives.
           
           **Phase 2: Rock Analysis**
           
           1.  **Head to the Sample Site:**  Rover 14 will then move to a designated configuration `#o5`, an area where my sensors are above a good cross section of rocks to use my manipulator. This is to gather the needed samples of rocks for analysis and transmit the analysis.
           2.  **Sampling Time:** With Rover 14 in position, I’ll use my manipulator with the `sample_rock` action on the available rock examples: `v1` (stone) and `v5` (soil). At the end of each `sample_rock` call, the store must be full, I have to empty the rocks to allow another.
           3.  **Empty the Stores:** The `drop_rock` action must be executed to remove the rock to prepare for sampling the next sample rock.
           4.  **Communicate:** Once the samples are in the rover’s store, I have to transmit the analysis. The rover will move to configuration `#o0`, to prepare to transmit the analysis to the lander `v9`. The rover will use the `send_analysis` action to transmit the rock analysis.
           5.  **Return to Base:** Lastly, Rover 14, now with its mission complete, will return to its initial configuration `v15`, ensuring that `atconf(v14, v15)` remains true.
           
           This sequence of actions, precisely executed, will ensure that I meet the goal of `new-axiom@0()`, capturing the images and performing the rock analysis. The plan is carefully constructed to ensure that preconditions are respected and that the required intermediate states are achieved. The key is to recognize the connections between actions, and the use of the different configurations needed to complete the tasks.

(Thoughts: **Plan Synthesis and Configuration Strategy**
           
           The previous attempt to solve the problem failed because specific configurations for the rover (v14) in relation to obstacle v21 were in collision. This obstacle, a thin wall at x=0, was blocking the direct line of sight required by the `imagevisible` predicate. The x-coordinates of previous rover positions `#o3` and `#o5` were either intersecting or very close to the x-range of v21.
           
           To resolve this, I need to find new configurations for `#o3` and `#o5` that avoid this collision. This means moving the rover to positions where its x-coordinate is significantly different from 0. The goal is to ensure an unobstructed view of all target objects for image capture and line of sight above target rocks for sampling.
           
           To satisfy the image capture goals (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`), I realized that using a single `#o3` configuration for all targets is impossible. These targets are located on opposite sides of v21. To capture images from opposite sides of v21 requires separate rover positions. The problem statement explicitly allows for different values for `#o3` for each rover/target pair if needed.
           
           Instead of one generic `#o3`, I'll define several configurations. I've designed specific configurations, such as `#o3_v17`, `#o3_v18`, `#o3_v19`, and `#o3_v20`. These are intended to be outside the conflicting x-range of obstacle v21. Distances were calculated to ensure a range of 2.
           
           *   `#o3_v17`: (-1.0, 1.5)
           *   `#o3_v18`: (1.5, 1.5)
           *   `#o3_v19`: (0.5, 1.5)
           *   `#o3_v20`: (-1.5, 1.5)
           
           To prepare for sending the images, an extra configuration for communication is needed. `#o0` will be (-1.0, -1.75). The rover needs to move to that location.
           
           I've selected the `above` configurations. For rock analysis, `#o5` will be above rocks.
           For the chosen rock:
           
           *   Stone: at `(-1.5025, -1.339)` (rover position: (-1.5, -1.0))
           *   Soil: `(0.97, -0.317)` (rover position: (1.0, -0.0))
           
           I've determined I need a separate configuration for each image or analysis. The move action supports move-to-configuration in the form `move(rover, previous-config, action-config, new-config)`.
           
           These new configuration values are a result of re-evaluating the problem and adapting to its constraints. The plan will now require additional steps:
           
           1.  Move the rover (`v14`) to image targets. Take the images.
           2.  Send the image data.
           3.  Sample rocks, drop them, and send their data.
           4.  Finally, return the rover to its initial configuration.

(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Rover v14's Movement**
           
           Okay, so I've been given some feedback that my initial configurations aren't "reachable" for the rover v14. Essentially, I need to make sure v14 can actually *get* to the spots I want it to go. I'm focusing on the "motion" predicates, which seem to imply a distance constraint. It looks like the system is rejecting configurations that are too far from v14's starting point, v15, which is at (-1.0, -1.75).
           
           I've learned a few things from the feedback:
           
           1.  **Distance Matters:**  It looks like a single "move" can't be too long.  I think the limit is around 2.0 units per step. Maybe up to 2.5/3.0.  I'll stay cautious with 2.0 for safety.
           2.  **Obstacles:**  There's a wall.  I need to ensure the rover's x-coordinate doesn't get blocked by the wall's x-range from `-0.05` to `0.05`.
           3.  **Unique Configurations:** It looks like I need a *unique* set of coordinates for the rover.
           
           So, here's my revised plan:
           
           *   **For targets that are far:** I'll introduce intermediate points. Think of it like pit stops!
           *   **For my intermediate configurations**: I'll make sure they don't have X coordinates between the obstacle, making sure the rover will not be blocked.
           *   **Distance Checks:** I'm carefully calculating distances between each move to make sure they're within the presumed 2.0 unit limit per step.
           
           **My detailed pathing and configurations**
           
           I'm dividing my approach into a series of coordinated, careful moves:
           
           1.  **Initial Plan**
               *   **Move:** From v15 to a config that allows me to image objective v17
               *   **Image:** Make an image of objective v17
               *   **Move:** From the config of v17 to a config that allows me to image objective v20
               *   **Image:** Make an image of objective v20
               *   **Move:** From the config of v20 to an intermediate point outside of the wall that lets me move right to objective configs
               *   **Move:** From the intermediate to a config that allows me to image objective v18
               *   **Image:** Make an image of objective v18
               *   **Move:** From the config of v18 to a config that allows me to image objective v19
               *   **Image:** Make an image of objective v19
               *   **Move:** To config that allows comm with v9 lander
               *   **Comm:** Send images from v17, v18, v19, v20
               *   **Move:** To a config to scan the sampling rocks v1
               *   **Scan:** Take sample of rock at v1
               *   **Comm:** Drop the sample at the lander
               *   **Move:** To a config to scan the sampling rock v7
               *   **Scan:** Take sample of rock at v7
               *   **Comm:** Drop the sample at the lander
               *   **Move:** To lander's comm config
               *   **Comm:** Send analyses for rock v1 and rock v7
               *   **Move:** Go back to the starting point v15
           
           **Additional Thoughts**
           
           I've now created a precise plan, defining each configuration with unique names to make sure they're not ambiguous. I'm making sure all the moves are relatively close. I'm taking the obstacle into account. I believe this plan should succeed, because all single-step distances do not appear to be more than 2.5, which is close to the rejected moves value of 3.25.

(Thoughts: **A Plan to Circumvent the Obstacle**
           
           I've been wrestling with this problem, and the solution seems to hinge on a very specific interpretation of the instructions. The core issue is this: the task demands that I use the same, generic configuration names like `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5` in my plan's *action instances*, even though I also need to provide *different* continuous values for these configurations based on the specific *target* (e.g., image target or sampling target) and rover involved.
           
           The previous plan failed because it tried to differentiate the configurations *within* the action instances (using names like `#o3_v17`). That's a no-go, as only the base names are allowed.
           
           The key insight is that while the action instances remain generic, the *system* must be capable of understanding that these generic names actually refer to different continuous value assignments depending on the surrounding context (specifically, the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` precondition and the given rover-target object pairing).
           
           This means my plan will use the generic `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5` in the actions themselves, but I'll *also* have to provide a "dictionary" of sorts, detailing the *specific* continuous values for each of these placeholders and their respective contexts in the `--Configurations--` section.  This means `#o3` won't be a single, fixed point, but rather a set of points (or more specifically, coordinate values) that are chosen for `v17, v18, v19, v20`.
           
           The plan unfolds in a way that respects this interpretation. It first distributes tasks between the rovers: `v14` (the one initially at `v15`) will focus on imaging objectives and rock analysis on the left side, and `v12` (the one at `v13`) focuses on the right side.
           
           For `v14`, this means:
           1.  Move to a specific configuration which fulfills `#o3`, meaning it allows the robot `v14` to take an image of `v17`.
           2.  Take image `v17`.
           3.  Move to a new coordinate assignment for `#o3` that allows imaging of `v20`.
           4.  Take image `v20`.
           5.  Move to an appropriate value for `#o0`, which facilitates communication with the lander `v9`.
           6.  Send both images.
           7.  Move to `#o5` and sample rocks, perform analysis, and release.
           8.  Move back to `v15`.
           
           Meanwhile, `v12`:
           1.  Move to a configuration which provides a coordinate for `#o3` to perform imaging.
           2.  Take images for objectives `v18`.
           3.  Move to another configuration value for `#o3` and take images for `v19`.
           4.  Move to value for `#o0` to perform communication with the lander.
           5.  Send the image data for `v18` and `v19`.
           6.  Return to `v13`.
           
           The critical piece here is the "contextual binding" of the continuous values to the placeholder configurations (`#o3`, `#o0`, `#o5`). If the action instances *strictly* require these to be specific coordinate positions, then the goal is unattainable. This "multiple value" interpretation of the general form objects is a deviation from typical PDDL practice, but it's essential for achieving the plan under the explicit instructions and within the given constraints.

(Thoughts: **The Crux of the Matter: Navigating a Planar Maze with Two Rovers**
           
           My goal is to craft a strategic plan, using the available PDDL domain, initial state, and valid actions, to achieve the objective: `new-axiom@0()`. This seemingly simple task hinges on a complex interplay of spatial constraints, object visibility, and, most crucially, the limited actions available to two robotic rovers.
           
           I face several challenges. The objective requires both rovers, `v12` and `v14`, to reach specific locations (`v13` and `v15` respectively), have a free storage space (`free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)`), capture and transmit images of four distinct objects (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`), and receive analyses of two rock samples (`v1`, `v5` and `v3`, `v8`). The catch? A persistent physical obstacle – a wall (`v21`) – separates the rovers, complicating direct traversal and communication.
           
           My initial thought is to divide and conquer: each rover will focus on tasks primarily on its side of the wall. Rover `v14` (left side) handles imaging of `v17` and `v20`, sampling of rocks `v1` and `v5`, and communication with the lander `v9`. Rover `v12` (right side) manages the imaging of `v18` and `v19`.
           
           **Constraints and Complications:**
           
           1.  **Immovable Rovers:** The initial state confirms that neither rover has actions to cross sides directly, cementing their roles to their assigned side.
           2.  **Reachability and Intermediate Steps:** Continuous coordinates were proving problematic. It seemed like the continuous coordinates I provided would be too far for a single `move` action from the current `atconf` state, necessitating step-by-step movement. These continuous values needed to be close to `v15` or `v13`.
           3.  **The Mystery of #o Objects:** The valid actions are restricted to actions like `move v14 #o3 #o2 #o3`. These must represent intermediate configurations, which are defined by continuous values for "#oX" configurations. Since continuous values are specific to the rover and its objectives, this also must be used for those steps. These are *fixed symbolic names*, yet they could have *multiple continuous values*.
           4.  **The Obstacle and Visibility:** The "not reachable" errors made this harder. The problem requires that `v21` is *not* considered an obstacle for `imagevisible` or `comvisible` rays, making this scenario physically impossible. However, my choices of locations for `#o3` and `#o0`, where I define, for example, `#o3` for all images for `v14`, were giving 'not reachable' errors. The `motion` predicates must be used for this.
           
           **The Strategy (Refined, Iterated):**
           
           The plan must address both reachability and object visibility within the valid actions.
           
           **Rover `v14` (Left Side):**
           
           1.  Start: `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)`
           2.  Move to `#o3`: Intermediate locations (close to `v15`) for intermediate y-values to handle the height, such as `(-1.0, -0.5)`. This helps bridge the long distances.
           3.  Move to *different* `#o3`: For `v17`'s visibility (at `(-0.7, 1.5)`)
           4.  Move to *different* `#o3`: For `v20`'s visibility (at `(-1.5, 1.8)`).
           5.  Move to *different* `#o5`: to access the low-y area for sampling.
           6.  `Sample v1`, `sample v5`.
           7.  Move to `#o0` (v15) for communication with the lander.
           
           **Rover `v12` (Right Side):**
           A similar method applies.
           
           The continuous values must now be carefully chosen for the valid action names to allow for a successful run.

           2.  Move to `#o3`: Intermediate locations (close to `v15`) for intermediate y-values to handle the height, such as `(-1.0, -0.5)`. This helps bridge the long distances.
           3.  Move to *different* `#o3`: For `v17`'s visibility (at `(-0.7, 1.5)`)
           4.  Move to *different* `#o3`: For `v20`'s visibility (at `(-1.5, 1.8)`).
           5.  Move to *different* `#o5`: to access the low-y area for sampling.
           6.  `Sample v1`, `sample v5`.
           7.  Move to `#o0` (v15) for communication with the lander.
           
           **Rover `v12` (Right Side):**
           A similar method applies.
           
           The continuous values must now be carefully chosen for the valid action names to allow for a successful run.
