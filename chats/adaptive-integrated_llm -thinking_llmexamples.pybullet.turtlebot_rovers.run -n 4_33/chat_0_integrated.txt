           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Unreachable Due to Configuration Constraints**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of my thinking. My goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which I've unpacked. To make it work, I need the rovers to take and send images, and also sample and send analysis for a rock and soil. I've broken this down into a series of steps that rely heavily on the rovers' *configuration* – their precise location.
           
           The problem, as I see it, is a conflict between the rovers' current configurations, explicitly stated in the initial state, and the locations those configurations *need* to be in for the actions to work.
           
           The rovers start at `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`. However, to take images, they need to be at configuration `#o3`. To send those images, and the analysis, they need to be at `#o0`. And to sample the rocks/soil, they must be at `#o5`. There's the rub – I can see from the available move actions, I *cannot* get them to any of these locations.
           
           The *only* move actions available are identity movements, which just keep the rovers where they are. This means I can't move them from their initial configurations (`v13` and `v15`) to the configurations required for the actions to work (`#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5`). All the necessary actions depend on the rovers being at certain, specific, configurations - and the initial state makes it impossible to reach those configurations.
           
           I've reviewed the problem statement and the available actions meticulously, and I can't see any other way to overcome this. I've double and triple-checked the constraints. Because I'm blocked by this configuration issue, I conclude the goal is unattainable with the given actions and initial state.
