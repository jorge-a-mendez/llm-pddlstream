           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes several objects (`#o0`, `#o1`, `#o2`, `v3` to `v18`).
           The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both are initially handempty.
           There are three graspable and stackable objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v15`.
           `v8` is at pose `v9` and is supported by `v11` (which is a sink, based on `type(v8, v17)` and the axiom `new-axiom@0()`). `v8` can also be at pose `#o2` and supported by `v10` (a stove, based on `type(v8, v17)` and `stackable(v8, v10)`) or `v18`.
           `v12` is at pose `v13` and is supported by `v14`. `v12` can also be at pose `#o2` and supported by `v10` or `v18`.
           `v15` is at pose `v16` and is supported by `v11`. `v15` can also be at pose `#o2` and supported by `v10`.
           The robot is at base configuration `v3`.
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be achieved if `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. From the given initial state, `v8` and `v12` are of type `v17`. `v18` is a surface. Thus, the goal is to have either `v8` or `v12` `on` `v18`. This means either `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)` or `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)`.
           From the initial state, `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` are true. So, if we place either `v8` or `v12` at pose `#o2`, the goal can be achieved.
           However, the only action instance available is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action doesn't change the state of objects `v8`, `v12`, or `v15` being on `v18`. Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the given available action instances.
           
           The goal is not achievable with the provided action instances.
