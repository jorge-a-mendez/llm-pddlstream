           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes several objects (`#o0` to `#o4`, `v3` to `v18`), some of which are graspable (`v15`, `v8`, `v12`) and stackable. The robot has two arms (`v4`, `v6`), both are handempty. There are also various poses and configurations for objects and the robot.
           
           The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which by its definition means `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. Looking at the initial state, we have `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`. This means that either `v8` or `v12` could be the object `?green`. We also have `stackable(v8, v18)` and `stackable(v12, v18)`. Therefore, if we can place either `v8` or `v12` on `v18`, the goal will be achieved.
           
           Let's consider `v8`. Currently, `v8` is `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`. To achieve `on(v8, v18)`, we need to `place` `v8` onto a pose `p` such that `supported(v8, p, v18)` is true and then `atpose(v8, p)`. We have `pose(v8, #o2)` and `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. So, the target pose for `v8` is `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           The robot arm `v4` can `pick` `v8` from `v9` and `place` it at `#o2`.
           
           The sequence of actions would be:
           1. Pick `v8` from `v9` using arm `v4`.
           2. Place `v8` at `#o2` using arm `v4`.
           
           Let's check the preconditions for these actions.
           For `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`:
           - `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`: True in initial state.
           - `atpose(v8, v9)`: True in initial state.
           - `handempty(v4)`: True in initial state.
           - `atbconf(#o3)`: False. The initial state has `atbconf(v3)`. However, there is a `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)` and `btraj(#o0)`. This implies that `#o3` could be `v3` or some other base configuration that can be reached. Looking at the `kin` predicates, `#o3` is a base configuration. The given `move_base` action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` doesn't change the base configuration, so `atbconf(v3)` is the only base configuration we know is true. If `#o3` cannot be `v3`, then this plan is not possible. However, the problem statement provides `bconf(#o3)`. It is implied that `#o3` represents a possible base configuration that can be reached. Assuming `#o3` can be resolved to `v3` for the sake of planning, or that it is a base configuration where the robot already is. Let's assume the `kin` fact implies that `#o3` is the base configuration needed for this specific kin.
           - `NegatedAtom unsafeapproach(v8, v9, #o1)`: No information to confirm this is true, but no `unsafeapproach` facts are in the initial state.
           - `NegatedAtom unsafeatraj(#o4)`: No information to confirm this is true, but no `unsafeatraj` facts are in the initial state.
           
           Let's proceed with the assumption that `#o3` will be resolved to the current base configuration `v3` or is a valid base configuration without needing a `move_base` action, and that the `unsafe` conditions are not met.
           
           --Plan--:
           (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     My apologies. I overlooked the crucial constraint that I am only allowed to use the explicitly provided action instances. The only valid action instance provided is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.
           
           This action instance `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` changes the state from `atbconf(v3)` to `atbconf(v3)` and consumes `canmove()`. It does not help in manipulating any objects (picking, placing, cleaning, or cooking).
           
           The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. As identified previously, this requires placing an object of `type v17` (either `v8` or `v12`) onto `v18`.
           However, neither `pick` nor `place` actions are available in the provided list of valid action instances. Without these actions, the robot cannot manipulate any objects to change their `on` status.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable with the given allowed actions.
