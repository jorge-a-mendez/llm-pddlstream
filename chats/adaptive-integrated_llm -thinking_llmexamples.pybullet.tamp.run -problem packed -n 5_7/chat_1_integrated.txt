           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.072, -0.327), (0.003, -0.252)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.053, 0.458), (0.045, 0.556)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.147, -0.45), (-0.057, -0.36)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.248, -0.336), (-0.152, -0.24)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.034, -0.289, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.729, 0.684).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.249, 0.5), (-0.158, 0.591)).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.004, 0.507, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.953, -0.304).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.102, -0.405, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.984, 0.178).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.2, -0.288, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.269, 0.963).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.203, 0.545, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.981, 0.193).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching the Unreachable: A Dead End**
           
           Okay, so the task is clear: get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` onto `v20`.  Simple enough, right?  The catch is, they're currently sitting on `v11`, and I'm only given *one* action instance: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  That's a dead end as far as I can tell.
           
           Let's break this down.  To get an object *on* a surface, I need to manipulate its *atpose* and *supported* predicates.  And the only action that does that is `place`.  But hang on...  I don't see any `place` action instances in the list.  Not good.
           
           I need a `place` action with the right kinematics, grasping, base configuration, and importantly, *safe* poses and trajectories.  The initial state *does* provide me with kinematics, poses, and grasps - everything I need for a *place* action. However, without an actual `place` action *instance*, it's useless. I have to *use* the given action instances - I can't build them from scratch.
           
           The problem is explicitly stated: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."  The only allowed action is `move_base`. Clearly, `move_base` doesn't alter *atpose* or *supported*. That means... I can't move the objects, at all.
           
           This means my plan is impossible to reach. There is no way I can manipulate these objects to get the desired `on` predicates using only `move_base`. Without *pick* or *place* instances, I'm stuck.
           
           I'm pretty certain there's no way around it.  The logic is straightforward, and the rules are explicit. The provided action instances dictate the scope of my planning capabilities.  And with only `move_base`, I'm blocked. It's a classic example of planning with restricted actions, a problem well-known in the literature.
