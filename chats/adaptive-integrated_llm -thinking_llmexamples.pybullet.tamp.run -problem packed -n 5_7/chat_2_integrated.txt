           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.072, -0.327), (0.003, -0.252)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.053, 0.458), (0.045, 0.556)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.147, -0.45), (-0.057, -0.36)).

           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.034, -0.289, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.729, 0.684).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.249, 0.5), (-0.158, 0.591)).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.004, 0.507, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.953, -0.304).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.102, -0.405, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.984, 0.178).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.2, -0.288, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.269, 0.963).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.203, 0.545, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.981, 0.193).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Relocation**
           
           My primary goal is to efficiently move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) from their current locations to the top of object v20. The key constraint is that the `on` predicate, which signifies an object being "on" another, is derived from the `supported` and `atpose` predicates.  This dictates that I must find a stable and collision-free pose on v20 for each object.
           
           Currently, all objects reside on a larger surface, v11. The robot at my disposal has two arms; however, only arm v4, with a given kinematics model, is relevant to this task. The robot's base currently is at `v3`, but all actions involving picking and placing rely on the base being in the `v10` state.
           
           My plan breaks down the problem by focusing on each object individually:
           
           1.  **v8:** Must be picked from its current pose `v9` and placed onto v20.
           2.  **v12:** Must be picked from its current pose `v13` and placed onto v20.
           3.  **v14:** Must be picked from its current pose `v15` and placed onto v20.
           4.  **v16:** Must be picked from its current pose `v17` and placed onto v20.
           5.  **v18:** Must be picked from its current pose `v19` and placed onto v20.
           
           I'll leverage the available actions: `move_base`, `pick`, and `place`, ignoring `clean` and `cook` as they are irrelevant. All "kin" information given are relevant to a base configuration state of `#o3`.
           
           Given that I only use `arm v4`, the basic plan structure consists of the `move_base` action followed by pick/place actions for each object. This means I would begin with a `move_base` action from the initial base configuration `v3` to the computed base configuration `#o3`. Then, I will sequentially employ the `pick` action to grasp each object with arm `v4` and then employ the `place` action to release each respective object at its desired target pose on the surface of `v20`. The move base action is placed at the beginning to efficiently change from a base configuration `v3` to a new base configuration of `#o3`.
           
           Regarding collision checks, there are no initial collision problems, and I will be placing the target poses in a structured arrangement.
           
           `v20` has an AABB of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. Thus, I will carefully choose the placement for the objects to be within that AABB with respect to each other.
           
           The basic plan for a single object is as follows:
           
           1.  `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` (If the robot isn't already at `#o3`)
           2.  `pick v4 <object> <current_pose> #o1 #o3 #o4`
           3.  `place v4 <object> #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           
           Given that the base configuration `v3` will change to configuration state `#o3` and that no other states exist, after the `move_base` action, all subsequent pick-and-place actions will be straightforward. I will also assume all collision checks are done with the new continuous states.
           
           I will assign `#o2` values differently for each object when placing them on the table. Each object at the beginning has a location `pose(obj, #o2)` in the initial state. Since each object has different initial and placed locations, there will be different continuous parameters to accommodate.
           
           After considering dimensions for each, I decided to place the objects in a grid structure on v20:
           *   v8: (-0.05, -0.1, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   v12: (0.05, -0.1, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   v14: (-0.05, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   v16: (0.05, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   v18: (0.0, 0.1, 0.781, 0.0)
           
           With all of this in mind, the final plan is:
           1.  `

(Thoughts: **Plan Refinement: Addressing Feedback on Placement and Format**
           
           Okay, I've received some valuable feedback on the previous plan, and I need to make a few critical adjustments. First, the format of `#o3`, which represents a base configuration, was incorrect. The expected format in the `--Poses--` section is for poses that take the form `pose(obj, #name)`, and base configurations don't fit that structure. Therefore, I'll need to remove `#o3` from the poses list in the final plan.
           
           The more significant issue is the instability of object placements on `v20`. The AABBs of the objects weren't fully contained within `v20`'s AABB for the specified `#o2` poses. I need to recalculate the placement poses for `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` to ensure stability.
           
           Let's dive into the details. `v20` is a square surface with dimensions `0.27 x 0.27`, centered at the origin. I've taken a look at the object AABBs. I've estimated that the objects' dimensions are roughly around 0.1 x 0.1 meters, therefore, I will consider a buffer for placement. To ensure stable placement, I need to make sure that the center of each object lies within a region of `v20` that takes into account the object's dimensions. For a standard 0.1 x 0.1 object, this translates to keeping the center within a 0.17 x 0.17 space around the origin.
           
           To address the placement issues, I've worked out a simple 2x2 grid, with an additional object at the center, ensuring a small buffer. It is as follows:
           
           - v8: (-0.06, 0.06, 0.781, 0.0)
           - v12: (0.06, 0.06, 0.781, 0.0)
           - v14: (-0.06, -0.06, 0.781, 0.0)
           - v16: (0.06, -0.06, 0.781, 0.0)
           - v18: (0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           
           Using the new values, each object will comfortably remain within the bounds of v20.
           
           Finally, I need to clarify the nature of continuous vs. discrete parameters, according to the structure requested. From the initial state and the prompt, it appears the variables that take continuous parameters are:
           - `#o0`: btraj
           - `#o1`: grasp
           - `#o2`: pose
           - `#o3`: bconf
           - `#o4`: atraj
           
           Only `#o2` requires continuous values. `#o3` is a base configuration, which does not require a value in the `--Poses--` section based on the specified format for continuous parameters.
           
           I will re-evaluate all initial state facts and verify these, however, the plan structure will be the same, but with adjustments to the pose values for `#o2`, and the removal of `#o3` from the `--Poses--` section.
