(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5, a 0.07 x 0.07 square, on Surface 0, which is defined by the coordinates (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0).  A stable placement means the object is fully inside the surface bounds and doesn't collide with anything. No obstacles or other objects are given yet, so it's a clean slate.
           
           Let's break this down.  Surface 0 is a 0.6 x 0.6 square. The key here is the object's square shape.  Since the prompt refers to axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs), the dimensions of object 5, regardless of its rotation, will always be an AABB of 0.07x0.07. But, because the square's AABB is determined by the local coordinates, rotating the object does change the AABB within the world. I need to account for this rotation when deciding the available placements.
           
           Here's my strategy:  I'll generate a grid of valid positions within Surface 0. Then, I'll rotate each object and account for how much that changes the valid placement space to ensure no collision will occur. My approach assumes that the given `size_x` and `size_y` represent the object *before* rotation.  This requires calculating the bounding box after rotation, which I can do using this formula to determine the AABB's center `h`: `0.035 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`
           Since the object is square, `half_effective_width` and `half_effective_height` are the same, meaning `half_effective_width` and `half_effective_height` are always the same.
           
           The maximum `h` occurs when `theta = pi/4 + k*pi/2`, so the worst-case scenario occurs when theta is one of these: when the angle is `pi/4`. This means I'll create a grid on the inside that is 0.50102 x 0.50102 and make the grid.
           
           Therefore, `h = 0.04949`. Using the surface, with that in mind, my x and y positions will be within the ranges [4.24949, 4.75051] and [-0.55051, -0.04949].
           
           I'll generate a 7x7 grid of x,y positions within these bounds, a total of 49 points. These coordinates are:  `4.24949`, `4.332993`, `4.416496`, `4.500000`, `4.583503`, `4.667006`, and `4.75051` for the x-coordinates; -0.55051, -0.467007, -0.383504, -0.300000, -0.216497, -0.132994, -0.04949 for the y-coordinates. I will have a unique position, and rotation for each square. To determine the angles I want, I will calculate from `0.0`, `0.897597` (2pi/7), `1.795195` (4pi/7), `2.692792` (6pi/7), `3.590390` (8pi/7), `4.487987` (10pi/7), and `5.385585` (12pi/7).
           
           I'll cycle through these angles for each position to ensure complete coverage.  I need a total of 50 placements, so I'll add one additional placement at the center of the surface (`4.5`, `-0.3`) rotated at `pi` radians.
           
           This ensures I have a diverse set of placements that are all stable within the surface bounds, considering the object's square shape and the impact of rotation on its bounding box.
