User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room defined by bounding boxes 0-4. Box 5 is a wall in the middle of the room, splitting it in half along the y-axis, centered at x=0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered around, some of which are narrow and some are small squares.
           Given target point (-0.007624108846395357, 0.4037563177897298), I need to find 3 base positions within a max distance of 2 from it. I should prioritize positions that are likely to have line-of-sight and avoid the known obstacles.
           
           The target point is very close to the central wall (box 5). I should try to place the robot on either side of this wall.
           1. Directly to the left of the wall, slightly below the target, to avoid potential occlusions by objects 10 and 20.
           2. Directly to the right of the wall, slightly below the target, for similar reasons.
           3. Slightly further away, in the bottom-left quadrant, as it is relatively clear.
           
           Positions:
           (-0.7 0.3)
           (0.7 0.3)
           (-1.0 -0.5)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     My previous attempts failed for the target point (1.870581030845642, 2.03356671333313, 0.20100000500679016).
           Positions (-0.7, 0.3) and (0.7, 0.3) had no line of sight, likely due to the central wall (box 5) and the target being in the top right quadrant, meaning I should be trying positions to the right of the central wall.
           Position (-1.0, -0.5) collided with obstacle 12, which is located in the bottom-left quadrant.
           
           For the new target point, I need to find positions within 2 distance from it. Since the target is in the top-right quadrant, I should focus my search there. I need to avoid box 5 and other obstacles in the area. Obstacles 7, 8, 9, 10, 19, 20, 21, 22 are in the top half of the room. The target is specifically near obstacles 7, 22.
           
           Given the target (1.870581030845642, 2.03356671333313), which is in the top right corner:
           1. Try a position slightly to the left and below the target to ensure line of sight, while still being in the top right quadrant.
           2. Try a position directly below the target.
           3. Try a position to the right of the target (closer to the wall).
           
           Positions:
           (1.0 1.5)
           (1.8 1.0)
           (2.0 1.8)

Model:     My previous attempts failed for the target point (-2.0533411502838135, 1.8982203006744385).
           Positions (1.0, 1.5), (1.8, 1.0) had no line of sight, which makes sense as the target is in the top-left quadrant and these positions are in the top-right. The central wall (box 5) likely blocked line of sight.
           Position (2.0, 1.8) collided with obstacle 7. This also makes sense as it's far from the target and likely in an obstructed area.
           
           For the new target point, I need to find positions within 2 distance from it. The target (-2.0533411502838135, 1.8982203006744385) is in the top-left quadrant. I need to avoid box 5 and other obstacles in the area. Obstacles 8 and 21 are in this top-left region.
           
           1. Try a position directly below the target, keeping a safe distance from obstacle 21.
           2. Try a position to the right of the target, but still well within the left half of the room, to ensure line of sight and avoid the central wall (box 5).
           3. Try a position diagonally to the lower-left, giving more space.
           
           Positions:
           (-2.0 0.5)
           (-1.0 1.5)
