(Thoughts: **Placing Object 5 on Surface 0: A Systematic Approach**
           
           Alright, I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5, a nearly square object with dimensions close to 0.08x0.08, on a square surface of size 0.27x0.27 centered at the origin.  "Stable" means the object stays entirely within the surface boundaries.
           
           Because the object is nearly a square, and the surface is much larger, I'll simplify the calculations. The key is understanding how rotation affects the object's effective dimensions.  I'll use `h_rot`, the object's half-extents after accounting for rotation. Since `hw_eff` and `hh_eff` are almost equal due to the object's near-square shape, `h_rot = (size_x/2 * abs(cos(theta)) + size_y/2 * abs(sin(theta)))`.
           
           To get diverse placements, I'll generate 10 evenly spaced rotation angles between 0 and 2*pi. For each angle, I need 5 positions. I'll place the object at the center of the available region and near the corners and middle of the edges to ensure wide coverage. Specifically:
           1. The region's center.
           2. The top-left corner.
           3. The bottom-right corner.
           4. The middle of the left edge.
           5. The middle of the top edge.
           
           This strategy ensures that the object is not just placed randomly, or clustered. Each x and y coordinate will be determined by the valid region: [`surf_min_x + h_rot`, `surf_max_x - h_rot`] and [`surf_min_y + h_rot`, `surf_max_y - h_rot`]. This approach guarantees 50 valid, stable placements, perfectly within the surface bounds.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 4**
           
           Alright, let's get down to brass tacks. I've got a new request: object ID 4 needs to find a home on surface 0, and I've got a specific surface and a specific object already there to worry about.  The task is to find 50 stable placements, but there's a catch - object 5 is already happily settled, and I need to avoid any collisions.  I'll need to be clever here, so let's break this down.
           
           Object 4 is almost square, with sizes of approximately 0.08 by 0.08.  Surface 0 is a square, -0.135 to 0.135 in x and y.  Object 5 is centered at the origin.
           
           I know how to calculate stability: I need to determine the effective bounding box of object 4,  taking into account the rotation angle, the half-extents, and then keeping it within the surface area. I also know how to figure out collisions:  two bounding boxes are colliding if their x and y ranges overlap.  I need to use these principles to make sure the placements are valid.
           
           Now, I've got all the info on hand: Object 5's position, rotation, and dimensions. I've calculated the half-extents for both objects, and defined the surface parameters.
           
           The key to avoiding collisions is to ensure there's a space around Object 5 where object 4 can't go.  Since these two objects are almost square, the effective bounding box changes a lot with the angle.  If I can't place within that box, I'm out of luck.
           
           Let's put this into practice: I need to generate placement angles: I will generate placements for the four cardinal axes: 0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2.
           
           So, for each of these key angles, I'll calculate the 'collision avoidance region'.  It’ll be like a ‘forbidden zone’ around object 5. And it all hinges on whether this 'forbidden region' fits inside the actual boundary of surface 0.
           
           So, I will choose some angles at 0, pi/2, pi, and 3pi/2.  I generate points within those placement areas.  I will take 12-14 placements for the different angles so as to get 50, and ensure all placements don’t collide and are within bounds.
           
           This looks like a good plan. Let’s get to it.

(Thoughts: **My Task: Find 50 Stable Placements for a New Object (ID 7)**
           
           Here's the situation I'm facing: I need to place a new, nearly square object (Object 7, size ~0.09783) on a 2D surface (Surface 0, size -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y). Sounds simple, right? Wrong. The catch? I need to avoid collisions with two other objects already placed there: Object 5, centered at (0, 0), and Object 4, offset slightly.
           
           My initial thoughts: First, I have to ensure the object stays within the surface bounds – that's my stability condition. So, I calculated the effective half-extents (think of it as how far the object's center can be from the edge without poking out). I worked out it will be around 0.04891. My aim is to respect the surface x and y range limits `(-0.08608, 0.08608)`.
           
           Then the hard part: avoiding collisions. I have the location and size of Object 5 (a square) and Object 4. For that, I need to look at the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of my new object.
           -   Object 5 is centered at 0 and occupies x and y range of `[-0.0399, 0.0399]`.
           -   Object 4 is at `x` = `-0.087`, and occupies `[-0.127, -0.047]` x range.
           
           My strategy would be to avoid placing Object 7 where its AABB overlaps with the AABB of those existing objects. This becomes tricky because I've to check for collision in the `X` and `Y` axes. The calculation for collision is fairly simple: I have to ensure that `X` range for object 7  is not overlapping x-ranges of object 4 or 5 and similar logic for the `Y` axis.
           
           However, after detailed calculations, it looks like it's impossible to avoid collision no matter the object's orientation and that's the trouble!
           
           Here's why: I worked out that object 7 needs `0.09783` space. Object 5 has bounds `[-0.0399, 0.0399]`. Adding required space on each side makes the forbidden region (collision zone) for x and y both `(-0.088827, 0.088827)`.  Since the surface boundaries are `[-0.08608, 0.08608]`, any x and y value must be within this range, yet also *outside* the `(-0.088827, 0.088827)` range to avoid collision. This implies to be within two non-overlapping regions at the same time, this means it is mathematically impossible. I've proved it with detailed calculation. I also worked out for a rotated object (pi/4) and found that it made no difference. Object 7 is simply too large to fit without collision.
           
           The instructions tell me to try my best. The situation is difficult because it seems like the placements required don't exist, and the rules of the task contradict themselves. Still, I will generate placements based on surface position, and rely on the judge, as requested.
           
           Here's my plan:
           
           I'll create a grid of possible center points for Object 7 within the surface bounds, spreading them out evenly for each rotation. I'll use `theta = 0` (aligned with the axes) and `theta = pi/2` (rotated 90 degrees) for the best fit. I'll calculate the stable placements and hope the system can provide some guidance.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 6**
           
           Okay, I've got a handle on this. The task is to place Object 6 on Surface 0, a square centered at the origin, 50 times without any collisions.  I need to avoid the obstacles: Object 5 (centered at origin), Object 4 (shifted left), and Object 7 (down and left). Object 6 is almost square, meaning I can probably get away with placing it with a 0-degree rotation.
           
           First, I calculated the effective half-extents of the object based on its dimensions and the fact that it will most likely be placed at 0 degrees rotation. Then I defined the surface bounds ([-0.091538, 0.091538]) after considering the object's dimensions relative to the original surface. After doing these calculations, I determined an appropriate surface area that would avoid collision.
           
           I determined that there were two "strips" on the right side of the surface with no collisions. For simplicity, I've elected to place Object 6 with a 0-degree rotation to make the mathematics simpler.
           
           Region A (top-right strip):
           x values: `[0.0835, 0.085, 0.0865, 0.088, 0.0895]`
