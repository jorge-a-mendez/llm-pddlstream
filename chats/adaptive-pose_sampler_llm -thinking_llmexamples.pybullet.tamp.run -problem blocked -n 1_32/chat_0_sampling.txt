(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My primary goal is to generate 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0.  I've thoroughly analyzed the constraints to develop an efficient and diverse placement strategy.
           
           I've taken into account the object's square shape (0.07 x 0.07) and the surface's dimensions (0.6 x 0.6). The object's AABB will change based on its rotation, but since it's a square, the AABB remains a square. I've focused on generating a wide range of AABB sizes and orientations to achieve diversity.
           
           First, I've calculated that the AABB's dimensions vary with rotation, with the maximum size at 45 degrees and the minimum at 0 or 90 degrees. Recognizing this, I've chosen five representative angles (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2) to capture the various possible bounding box configurations.
           
           I've determined the valid placement area on the surface for each angle by computing the AABB's dimensions and the center coordinates (x,y) boundaries to ensure that the object remains entirely within the surface bounds.  For each angle, I will generate a set of coordinates (x,y) using a 5x2 grid.  These generate 50 unique placements to meet the requirements of the prompt. I've carefully accounted for various rotations and object placements, thereby increasing the diversity of the final placements.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Object Placement and Collision Avoidance: A Detailed Plan**
           
           I've been tasked with placing a new object (ID 10) on a surface where another object (ID 5) has already been successfully placed, but I need to avoid any collisions. My approach is to ensure that the new object's placement does not intersect with the existing object's bounding box.
           
           First, I need to understand the constraints: Object 5 is located at a specific point on the surface, with a known AABB. Object 10 is a square, and I'll need to consider its position relative to Object 5. I will work with the AABB of Object 5, which encompasses the range `((4.2, -0.6), (4.27, -0.53))`.
           
           My strategy will involve these steps:
           
           1.  **Angle Selection:** I'll consider a variety of angles, including 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, and pi/2, to determine Object 10's orientation.
           2.  **AABB Calculations:** For each angle, I will determine the bounding box's width and height of the rotated square.
           3.  **Placement Range:** I'll calculate valid placement ranges for Object 10's center to ensure it fits within the surface bounds, taking Object 5's position into account.
           4.  **Collision Avoidance:** The key is to generate an area such that the Object 10 AABB does not overlap with the Object 5 AABB. I will focus on placing Object 10 primarily to the right of Object 5, using a safety buffer based on Object 10's half-width. For each set of 10 points corresponding to a angle, I must ensure that at least one of these is true.
               *   `x_c - W/2 >= 4.27` (ensure it is to the right of 5's max X coord)
               *   `y_c - H/2 >= -0.53` (ensure it is above 5's max Y coord)
               *   `x_c + W/2 <= 4.2` (ensure it is to the left - but it won't fit here)
               *   `y_c + H/2 <= -0.6` (ensure it is below - but it won't fit here)
           
           I'll calculate the valid ranges for the object's center based on the orientation and surface. I must calculate the x- and y- coordinates to ensure there is an empty space between object 5 and the new object.
           
           I will generate 50 stable placements, evenly distributed across the chosen angles.
