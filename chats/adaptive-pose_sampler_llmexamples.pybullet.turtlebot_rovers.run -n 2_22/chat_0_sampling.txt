User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with inner boundaries at approximately x,y = +/-2.5. There's a central vertical wall at x=0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered around. I'm looking for positions within a circle of radius 2 centered at the target point (1.68415177 0.96349673). I will try to pick points that are somewhat spread out around the target, considering the obstacles. I need to avoid the obstacles identified by the given AABBs.
           
           Obstacle 5 at x=0 is a large vertical wall. This is a significant constraint.
           Obstacles 1, 2, 3, 4 are the outer walls of the room, defining the x and y limits.
           Obstacle 6 is a horizontal rectangular obstacle in the bottom-left quadrant.
           Obstacles 7, 8, 9, 10 are small square obstacles in the top-left and top-right quadrants.
           There are also several small rectangular obstacles (11-20) scattered throughout the environment.
           
           My strategy will be to:
           1. Identify the target point and its radius 2 search area.
           2. Consider the largest obstacles first, especially the x=0 wall (obstacle 5).
           3. Generate points that are within the search radius and on the same side of the x=0 wall as the target.
           4. Distribute these points to avoid the smaller obstacles and offer diverse viewing angles.
           
           Target point: (1.68415177 0.96349673)
           
           The target is in the top-right quadrant, so I'll prioritize positions with positive x values.
           
           Considering obstacle 5 at x=0, I will try to stay on the right side of it.
           The target is also close to obstacle 7 ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)). I should be careful not to place the base directly on top of it.
           Obstacle 12 ((0.811, 0.952), (0.951, 1.091)) is quite close to the target. I need to be careful with this one.
           
           I'll start by trying a point to the right of the target, then one slightly below, and one slightly above, all within the 2-unit radius and avoiding the identified obstacles.
           
           Positions:
           (1.8 0.1)
           (1.0 0.8)
           (2.2 1.5)
