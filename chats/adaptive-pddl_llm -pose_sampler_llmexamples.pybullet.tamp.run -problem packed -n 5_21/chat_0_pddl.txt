           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27. The object is also square, with side length approximately 0.0857. This means the object is significantly smaller than the surface, allowing for many possible placements.
           
           I will attempt to place the object on surface 0. Since the object is square, its orientation (rotation) does not affect its AABB dimensions, but it can still be rotated. I will try a variety of positions within the surface, covering the center and various corners and edges, and I will also try different rotations to ensure diversity. The object's half-extents are approximately 0.04284.
           
           The surface 0 has x bounds from -0.135 to 0.135 and y bounds from -0.135 to 0.135.
           For an object with half_size_x and half_size_y, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + half_size_x <= x <= 0.135 - half_size_x
           -0.135 + half_size_y <= y <= 0.135 - half_size_y
           
           With half_size_x = half_size_y = 0.04284:
           -0.135 + 0.04284 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.04284 => -0.09216 <= x <= 0.09216
           -0.135 + 0.04284 <= y <= 0.135 - 0.04284 => -0.09216 <= y <= 0.09216
           
           I will select positions that are within these bounds, trying to span the available space and varying the rotations.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface (surface 0) centered at the origin, with side length 0.27.
           There is already an object (ID 6) placed at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) on surface 0. Its extents are 0.08568892641634673 x 0.08568892641634673. This means it occupies the AABB from approximately (-0.04284, -0.04284) to (0.04284, 0.04284).
           
           The new object (ID 5) is also square, with side length approximately 0.0956. Its half-extents are approximately 0.0478.
           
           I need to find 50 stable placements for object 5 on surface 0, ensuring it does not collide with object 6.
           
           The placement of object 6 means the central region of the surface is occupied.
           The allowed area for object 5 on surface 0 is:
           -0.135 + 0.0478 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.0478 => -0.0872 <= x <= 0.0872
           -0.135 + 0.0478 <= y <= 0.135 - 0.0478 => -0.0872 <= y <= 0.0872
           
           So, object 5's center (x, y) must be within the square defined by these bounds, and additionally, its AABB must not overlap with object 6's AABB.
           Object 6's AABB: (-0.04284, -0.04284) to (0.04284, 0.04284).
           
           This means that for object 5, its x or y center must be sufficiently far from the origin.
           If object 5's center is (x_5, y_5) and its half-extents are (hx_5, hy_5), and object 6's AABB is from (x6_min, y6_min) to (x6_max, y6_max):
           Collision occurs if:
           (x_5 - hx_5 < x6_max AND x_5 + hx_5 > x6_min) AND (y_5 - hy_5 < y6_max AND y_5 + hy_5 > y6_min)
           
           With hx_5 = hy_5 = 0.0478 and object 6 occupying (-0.04284, -0.04284) to (0.04284, 0.04284):
           Collision if:
           (x_5 - 0.0478 < 0.04284 AND x_5 + 0.0478 > -0.04284) AND (y_5 - 0.0478 < 0.04284 AND y_5 + 0.0478 > -0.04284)
           Simplified for x: x_5 < 0.04284 + 0.0478 = 0.09064 AND x_5 > -0.04284 - 0.0478 = -0.09064
           Simplified for y: y_5 < 0.04284 + 0.0478 = 0.09064 AND y_5 > -0.04284 - 0.0478 = -0.09064
           
           So, object 5's center (x_5, y_5) must be outside the square region defined by:
           -0.09064 < x_5 < 0.09064 AND -0.09064 < y_5 < 0.09064
           
           Combining with surface bounds:
           x: [-0.0872, 0.0872]
           y: [-0.0872, 0.0872]
           
           The non-collision constraint means that we must have:
           x_5 <= -0.09064 (impossible, outside surface bounds) OR x_5 >= 0.09064 (impossible, outside surface bounds) OR
           y_5 <= -0.09064 (impossible, outside surface bounds) OR y_5 >= 0.09064 (impossible, outside surface bounds)
           
           This is tricky. Let's re-evaluate the collision check carefully.
           Object 5's AABB: [x_5 - 0.0478, x_5 + 0.0478] x [y_5 - 0.0478, y_5 + 0.0478]
           Object 6's AABB: [-0.04284, 0.04284] x [-0.04284, 0.04284]
           
           No collision if:
           (x_5 + 0.0478 <= -0.04284) OR (x_5 - 0.0478 >= 0.04284) OR
           (y_5 + 0.0478 <= -0.04284) OR (y_5 - 0.0478 >= 0.04284)
           
           This simplifies to:
           (x_5 <= -0.04284 - 0.0478 = -0.09064) OR (x_5 >= 0.04284 + 0.0478 = 0.09064) OR
           (y_5 <= -0.04284 - 0.0478 = -0.09064) OR (y_5 >= 0.04284 + 0.0478 = 0.09064)
           
           Combining with the surface limits for object 5:
           -0.0872 <= x_5 <= 0.0872
           -0.0872 <= y_5 <= 0.0872
           
           This means that according to the exact AABB collision logic, there is *no possible stable placement* for object 5 on surface 0 without colliding with object 6.
           Let me double check my numbers.
           Surface 0 max extent for center x: 0.135 - 0.0478 = 0.0872
           Surface 0 min extent for center x: -0.135 + 0.0478 = -0.0872
           So, x_5 must be in [-0.0872, 0.0872].
           The condition for no collision in x is x_5 <= -0.09064 or x_5 >= 0.09064.
           These ranges for x_5 do not overlap: [-0.0872, 0.0872] and ((-inf, -0.09064] U [0.09064, inf)).
           The same applies to y.
           
           This means that any placement for object 5's center (x_5, y_5) within the surface bounds will *always* result in an AABB collision with object 6.
           This could be an issue with the problem setup or my interpretation. Given the instructions "You never give up", I must try to find placements.
           
           Perhaps the collision check uses exact geometry and the AABB of object 6 is slightly smaller than assumed, or perhaps the placement feedback mechanism is more lenient.
           However, if I assume standard AABB collision, then mathematically, no placement exists.
           
           Let me assume that perhaps the collision detection works with a small epsilon, or that I should attempt to place it as far as possible, pushing it to the boundaries. I will try the placements that are closest to being outside the collision region, by trying the corners of the allowed placement region for object 5. These are the positions where the center is at approximately (-0.0872, -0.0872), (-0.0872, 0.0872), (0.0872, -0.0872), (0.0872, 0.0872), and along the edges.
           
           These positions *are* within the collision region based on AABBs.
           Example: (0.0872, 0.0872).
           x_5 = 0.0872. x_5 - 0.0478 = 0.0394. x_5 + 0.0478 = 0.135.
           Object 5 AABB x-range: [0.0394, 0.135]
           Object 6 AABB x-range: [-0.04284, 0.04284]
           These do not collide in x. So if x_5 is 0.0872, there is no collision in x.
           Wait, my collision logic for no collision was:
           (x_5 + 0.0478 <= -0.04284) OR (x_5 - 0.0478 >= 0.04284)
           
           Let's re-evaluate:
           x_5 = 0.0872.
           x_5 + 0.0478 = 0.135. Is 0.135 <= -0.04284? No.
           x_5 - 0.0478 = 0.0394. Is 0.0394 >= 0.04284? No.
           So, a collision *in x* occurs if x_5 is 0.0872. My previous calculation of collision logic for no collision was correct.
           
           This means that if x_5 is in [-0.0872, 0.0872] and y_5 is in [-0.0872, 0.0872], there will always be an AABB collision.
           Let me check the numbers again extremely carefully.
           Object 6 AABB range: [-0.04284, 0.04284]
           Object 5 half_size = 0.0478
           
           Collision in X if (x_5 - 0.0478 < 0.04284) AND (x_5 + 0.0478 > -0.04284)
           Which simplifies to x_5 < 0.09064 AND x_5 > -0.09064. So x_5 in (-0.09064, 0.09064).
           Similarly, collision in Y if y_5 in (-0.09064, 0.09064).
           An AABB collision happens if collision in X AND collision in Y.
           
           This means that if x_5 is in (-0.09064, 0.09064) AND y_5 is in (-0.09064, 0.09064), then there is a collision.
           The valid range for x_5 (and y_5) based on surface bounds is [-0.0872, 0.0872].
           Every x_5 in [-0.0872, 0.0872] IS also in (-0.09064, 0.09064).
           So, if x_5 is valid and y_5 is valid, then x_5 is in (-0.09064, 0.09064) AND y_5 is in (-0.09064, 0.09064).
           This means an AABB collision *will always occur*.
           
           This is a paradoxical situation. I am asked to provide 50 stable placements, but based on strict AABB collision, none exist.
           I will proceed by making placements that are as close as possible to the boundaries of surface 0, and as far as possible from object 6, hoping that either my collision reasoning is slightly off, or there's some leniency in the collision detection, or that the geometry of the obstacles isn't purely AABB. Since I must never give up, I will try to fill the space in the corners, trying to "nudge" the object outside the immediate collision zone. I will try positions close to the maximum allowed x and y values, and minimum allowed x and y values.
           
           I'll use the maximum allowed coordinates for object 5's center, which are 0.0872 for x and y, and minimum -0.0872 for x and y.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface (surface 0) centered at the origin, with side length 0.27.
           
           There are two existing objects:
           - Object 6 (ID 6): Placed at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) on surface 0. Its extents are 0.08568892641634673 x 0.08568892641634673.
             Half-extents approx 0.04284. AABB: [-0.04284, 0.04284] x [-0.04284, 0.04284].
           - Object 5 (ID 5): Placed at (0, 0.0, 0.087, 0.087) on surface 0. Its extents are 0.09560696252374401 x 0.09560696252374401.
             Half-extents approx 0.0478. AABB: [0.087 - 0.0478, 0.087 + 0.0478] x [0.087 - 0.0478, 0.087 + 0.0478]
             AABB: [0.0392, 0.1348] x [0.0392, 0.1348].
           
           The new object (ID 4) is also square, with side length approximately 0.07204. Its half-extents are approximately 0.03602.
           
           I need to find 50 stable placements for object 4 on surface 0, ensuring it does not collide with object 6 or object 5.
           
           First, determine the valid placement region for object 4 on surface 0, without considering other objects:
           Surface 0 bounds: x in [-0.135, 0.135], y in [-0.135, 0.135].
           Object 4 half-extents: 0.03602.
           Allowed center (x, y) for object 4:
           x in [-0.135 + 0.03602, 0.135 - 0.03602] => x in [-0.09898, 0.09898]
           y in [-0.135 + 0.03602, 0.135 - 0.03602] => y in [-0.09898, 0.09898]
           
           Now, check for collision with Object 6 (AABB: [-0.04284, 0.04284] x [-0.04284, 0.04284]):
           Collision with O6 if (x_4 in (-0.04284 - 0.03602, 0.04284 + 0.03602)) AND (y_4 in (-0.04284 - 0.03602, 0.04284 + 0.03602))
           Collision with O6 if (x_4 in (-0.07886, 0.07886)) AND (y_4 in (-0.07886, 0.07886)).
           To avoid O6, x_4 must be <= -0.07886 or >= 0.07886, OR y_4 must be <= -0.07886 or >= 0.07886.
           
           Now, check for collision with Object 5 (AABB: [0.0392, 0.1348] x [0.0392, 0.1348]):
           Collision with O5 if (x_4 - 0.03602 < 0.1348 AND x_4 + 0.03602 > 0.0392) AND (y_4 - 0.03602 < 0.1348 AND y_4 + 0.03602 > 0.0392)
           Collision with O5 if (x_4 < 0.1348 + 0.03602 AND x_4 > 0.0392 - 0.03602) AND (y_4 < 0.1348 + 0.03602 AND y_4 > 0.0392 - 0.03602)
           Collision with O5 if (x_4 < 0.17082 AND x_4 > 0.00318) AND (y_4 < 0.17082 AND y_4 > 0.00318).
           So, collision with O5 if (x_4 in (0.00318, 0.17082)) AND (y_4 in (0.00318, 0.17082)).
           
           Combining the allowed region for object 4 (x, y in [-0.09898, 0.09898]) with the collision avoidance conditions:
           
           To avoid O6: x_4 in [-0.09898, -0.07886] U [0.07886, 0.09898] OR y_4 in [-0.09898, -0.07886] U [0.07886, 0.09898].
           To avoid O5: x_4 not in (0.00318, 0.17082) OR y_4 not in (0.00318, 0.17082).
           Within the allowed surface region, this means:
           x_4 in [-0.09898, 0.00318] U [0.17082, 0.09898] (second part is empty) => x_4 in [-0.09898, 0.00318].
           Similarly for y_4: y_4 in [-0.09898, 0.00318].
           So to avoid O5, at least one of these conditions must hold: x_4 in [-0.09898, 0.00318] OR y_4 in [-0.09898, 0.00318].
           
           Let's look at regions where we can place object 4.
           It needs to be outside the central square for O6: x_4 outside (-0.07886, 0.07886) or y_4 outside (-0.07886, 0.07886).
           And it needs to be outside the positive-x, positive-y square for O5: x_4 outside (0.00318, 0.17082) or y_4 outside (0.00318, 0.17082).
           
           The surface constraint for (x_4, y_4) is within [-0.09898, 0.09898] x [-0.09898, 0.09898].
           
           Let's try to find regions.
           Consider the top-left quadrant where x is negative and y is positive.
           Example: x = -0.08, y = 0.08
           x_4 = -0.08 is in [-0.09898, -0.07886], so it avoids O6 in x.
           y_4 = 0.08 is in [0.07886, 0.09898], so it avoids O6 in y.
           So if x_4 in [-0.09898, -0.07886] and y_4 in [0.07886, 0.09898], it avoids O6.
           For O5:
           x_4 = -0.08. Is -0.08 in (0.00318, 0.17082)? No. So it avoids O5 in x.
           y_4 = 0.08. Is 0.08 in (0.00318, 0.17082)? Yes. So it *might* collide with O5 in y.
           If both x_4 is in (0.00318, 0.17082) AND y_4 is in (0.00318, 0.17082), then there is an O5 collision.
           Since x_4 = -0.08 is not in (0.00318, 0.17082), there is no collision with O5 if x_4 is negative. This is good.
           
           So, any placement with x_4 <= 0.00318 or y_4 <= 0.00318, will avoid collision with O5.
           Let's simplify. I need to avoid the central region (O6) and the top-right region (O5).
           
           I will try placing it in the bottom-left, bottom-right, and top-left corners of the surface, pushing it to the boundaries.
           The maximum safe x and y for the center are 0.098.
           The minimum safe x and y for the center are -0.098.
           
           Let's try:
           1. Top-Left region (x negative, y positive):
              x: [-0.09898, -0.07886] (to avoid O6)
              y: [0.07886, 0.09898] (to avoid O6)
              Any x in this range avoids O5. Any y in this range might collide with O5 (0.07886 to 0.09898 is in (0.00318, 0.17082)).
              But since x is outside O5's x-range, this region (x < 0.00318) avoids O5.
              So, any (x,y) where x in [-0.09898, -0.07886] and y in [0.07886, 0.09898] should be valid.
              E.g., (-0.08, 0.08)
           
           2. Bottom-Left region (x negative, y negative):
              x: [-0.09898, -0.07886] (to avoid O6)
              y: [-0.09898, -0.07886] (to avoid O6)
              Again, x is outside O5's x-range (x < 0.00318), so this entire region avoids O5.
              So, any (x,y) where x in [-0.09898, -0.07886] and y in [-0.09898, -0.07886] should be valid.
              E.g., (-0.08, -0.08)
           
           3. Bottom-Right region (x positive, y negative):
              x: [0.07886, 0.09898] (to avoid O6)
              y: [-0.09898, -0.07886] (to avoid O6)
              Again, y is outside O5's y-range (y < 0.00318), so this entire region avoids O5.
              So, any (x,y) where x in [0.07886, 0.09898] and y in [-0.09898, -0.07886] should be valid.
              E.g., (0.08, -0.08)
           
           I will focus on these three corners. I'll pick values like +/-0.08 to +/-0.095 for x and y.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface (surface 0) centered at the origin, with side length 0.27.
           
           There are three existing objects:
           - Object 6 (ID 6): Placed at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) on surface 0. Extents: 0.08568892641634673 x 0.08568892641634673.
             Half-extents approx 0.04284. AABB: [-0.04284, 0.04284] x [-0.04284, 0.04284].
           - Object 5 (ID 5): Placed at (0, 0.0, 0.087, 0.087) on surface 0. Extents: 0.09560696252374401 x 0.09560696252374401.
             Half-extents approx 0.0478. AABB: [0.087 - 0.0478, 0.087 + 0.0478] x [0.087 - 0.0478, 0.087 + 0.0478]
             AABB: [0.0392, 0.1348] x [0.0392, 0.1348].
           - Object 4 (ID 4): Placed at (0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.08) on surface 0. Extents: 0.0720399615868293 x 0.07203996158682924.
             Half-extents approx 0.03602. AABB: [-0.08 - 0.03602, -0.08 + 0.03602] x [0.08 - 0.03602, 0.08 + 0.03602]
             AABB: [-0.11602, -0.04398] x [0.04398, 0.11602].
           
           The new object (ID 7) is also square, with side length approximately 0.09343. Its half-extents are approximately 0.046715.
           
           I need to find 50 stable placements for object 7 on surface 0, ensuring it does not collide with objects 6, 5, or 4.
           
           First, determine the valid placement region for object 7 on surface 0:
           Surface 0 bounds: x in [-0.135, 0.135], y in [-0.135, 0.135].
           Object 7 half-extents: 0.046715.
           Allowed center (x, y) for object 7:
           x in [-0.135 + 0.046715, 0.135 - 0.046715] => x in [-0.088285, 0.088285]
           y in [-0.135 + 0.046715, 0.135 - 0.046715] => y in [-0.088285, 0.088285]
           
           Now, determine collision avoidance for each existing object:
           
           1.  Avoid Object 6 (O6 AABB: [-0.04284, 0.04284] x [-0.04284, 0.04284]):
               Collision with O6 if (x_7 in (-0.04284 - 0.046715, 0.04284 + 0.046715)) AND (y_7 in (-0.04284 - 0.046715, 0.04284 + 0.046715))
               Collision with O6 if (x_7 in (-0.089555, 0.089555)) AND (y_7 in (-0.089555, 0.089555)).
               To avoid O6, x_7 must be <= -0.089555 or >= 0.089555, OR y_7 must be <= -0.089555 or >= 0.089555.
               However, the surface bounds for x_7 and y_7 are [-0.088285, 0.088285]. This means any placement for O7's center *will always* cause an AABB collision with O6.
               This is the same situation as with object 5 previously. The feedback showed that placement (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.087, 0.087 was successful even though my AABB analysis indicated a collision. This implies either the geometry used for collision is not strict AABB, or there's a small tolerance, or the actual object geometry is smaller than its AABB extents allow. Given this, I will try to place object 7 in the remaining "corners" or "edges" not occupied by 5 and 6, assuming that such placements can be found.
           
           Let's use the provided successful placements as reference points and try to stay away from them.
           O6 is at (0,0).
           O5 is at (0.087, 0.087). This is the top-right corner.
           O4 is at (-0.08, 0.08). This is the top-left corner.
           
           The available space seems to be primarily the bottom-left and bottom-right regions, and potentially the very edges.
           Let's re-examine the O6 collision for O5: O5 center (0.087, 0.087), half_size 0.0478.
           O5 AABB: [0.0392, 0.1348] x [0.0392, 0.1348].
           O6 AABB: [-0.04284, 0.04284] x [-0.04284, 0.04284].
           These do not overlap, as O5's min_x (0.0392) is not less than O6's max_x (0.04284). Oh, wait. O5's min_x (0.0392) is LESS than O6's max_x (0.04284). This means they do overlap in the x-dimension.
           And O5's min_y (0.0392) is also less than O6's max_y (0.04284). So they overlap in y-dimension.
           This means that O5 *should* have collided with O6 based on my AABB calculation. The successful placement of O5 at (0.087, 0.087) indicates that the collision logic is NOT a simple AABB check on the combined object bounding boxes. It must be something more precise, or with some tolerance, or the 'extents' are just for AABB guidance and not the full collision shape.
           
           Given this, I should try to place object 7 in areas that are geometrically plausible *around* the existing objects, rather than strictly relying on derived AABB non-overlap calculations. I will aim for areas that are not directly on top of, or tightly next to, the AABBs of the already placed objects.
           The surface's available x and y for O7's center: [-0.088285, 0.088285].
           
           Occupied regions (AABB-wise):
           O6: Center (0,0), radius 0.04284. Main central region.
           O5: Center (0.087, 0.087), radius 0.0478. Top-right corner.
           O4: Center (-0.08, 0.08), radius 0.03602. Top-left corner.
           
           So the top half of the surface is quite occupied. The remaining areas are mainly in the bottom half.
           I will try to place O7 in the bottom-left and bottom-right corners, and along the bottom edge, trying to be reasonably far from O6, and then also try some spots along the left/right edges, and if necessary, some spots in the middle where it might fit due to non-AABB collision.
           
           Candidate regions for center (x, y):
           - Bottom-left: x in [-0.088, -0.05], y in [-0.088, -0.05]
           - Bottom-right: x in [0.05, 0.088], y in [-0.088, -0.05]
           - Along bottom edge: x in [-0.04, 0.04], y in [-0.088, -0.05]
           
           Let's try to place it at the max/min coords for the object's center within the surface, such as:
           (-0.088, -0.088), (0.088, -0.088).
           Also try some points slightly inwards from these.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface (surface 0) centered at the origin, with side length 0.27.
           
           There are four existing objects:
           - Object 6 (ID 6): Placed at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) on surface 0. Extents: 0.08568892641634673 x 0.08568892641634673.
             Half-extents approx 0.04284. AABB: [-0.04284, 0.04284] x [-0.04284, 0.04284].
           - Object 5 (ID 5): Placed at (0, 0.0, 0.087, 0.087) on surface 0. Extents: 0.09560696252374401 x 0.09560696252374401.
             Half-extents approx 0.0478. AABB: [0.0392, 0.1348] x [0.0392, 0.1348]. (from 0.087-0.0478 to 0.087+0.0478)
           - Object 4 (ID 4): Placed at (0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.08) on surface 0. Extents: 0.0720399615868293 x 0.07203996158682924.
             Half-extents approx 0.03602. AABB: [-0.11602, -0.04398] x [0.04398, 0.11602]. (from -0.08-0.03602 to -0.08+0.03602, etc.)
           - Object 7 (ID 7): Placed at (0, 0.0, -0.085, -0.085) on surface 0. Extents: 0.09342819921014922 x 0.09342819921014922.
             Half-extents approx 0.046715. AABB: [-0.085 - 0.046715, -0.085 + 0.046715] x [-0.085 - 0.046715, -0.085 + 0.046715]
             AABB: [-0.131715, -0.038285] x [-0.131715, -0.038285].
           
           The new object (ID 8) is also square, with side length approximately 0.07255. Its half-extents are approximately 0.036275.
           
           I need to find 50 stable placements for object 8 on surface 0, ensuring it does not collide with objects 6, 5, 4, or 7.
           
           First, determine the valid placement region for object 8 on surface 0:
           Surface 0 bounds: x in [-0.135, 0.135], y in [-0.135, 0.135].
           Object 8 half-extents: 0.036275.
           Allowed center (x, y) for object 8:
           x in [-0.135 + 0.036275, 0.135 - 0.036275] => x in [-0.098725, 0.098725]
           y in [-0.135 + 0.036275, 0.135 - 0.036275] => y in [-0.098725, 0.098725]
           
           Now, identify occupied regions based on successful placements:
           - O6 AABB: [-0.04284, 0.04284] x [-0.04284, 0.04284] (Center)
           - O5 AABB: [0.0392, 0.1348] x [0.0392, 0.1348] (Top-right)
           - O4 AABB: [-0.11602, -0.04398] x [0.04398, 0.11602] (Top-left)
           - O7 AABB: [-0.131715, -0.038285] x [-0.131715, -0.038285] (Bottom-left)
           
           The new object (O8) half-extent is 0.036275.
           
           Let's estimate the "exclusion zones" for O8's center due to each existing object.
           O6 exclusion: x in (-0.04284 - 0.036275, 0.04284 + 0.036275) = (-0.079115, 0.079115) AND y in (-0.079115, 0.079115).
           O5 exclusion: x in (0.0392 - 0.036275, 0.1348 + 0.036275) = (0.002925, 0.171075) AND y in (0.002925, 0.171075).
           O4 exclusion: x in (-0.11602 - 0.036275, -0.04398 + 0.036275) = (-0.152295, -0.007705) AND y in (0.04398 - 0.036275, 0.11602 + 0.036275) = (0.007705, 0.152295).
           O7 exclusion: x in (-0.131715 - 0.036275, -0.038285 + 0.036275) = (-0.16799, -0.00201) AND y in (-0.16799, -0.00201).
           
           The problem states that previous successful placements are valid. This means my strict AABB collision calculation for previous requests might be overestimating collisions. I must assume that the provided successful placements are genuinely non-colliding for the exact geometry.
           The previous successes show objects placed in the corners.
           O6: Center (0,0) - occupies the very center.
           O5: Center (0.087, 0.087) - top-right (positive x, positive y).
           O4: Center (-0.08, 0.08) - top-left (negative x, positive y).
           O7: Center (-0.085, -0.085) - bottom-left (negative x, negative y).
           
           This leaves the bottom-right quadrant as the most open area, particularly the corner itself. There might also be space along the positive x-axis or negative y-axis that isn't fully blocked.
           The available range for O8's center is x, y in [-0.098725, 0.098725].
           
           Let's try the bottom-right corner.
           For x_8 in [0.05, 0.098], y_8 in [-0.098, -0.05].
           
           Check this region against the exclusion zones.
           Take x = 0.08, y = -0.08 as a candidate.
           Allowed by surface bounds: Yes, 0.08 is in [-0.098725, 0.098725].
           
           Check against O6 exclusion:
           x_8 = 0.08. Is 0.08 in (-0.079115, 0.079115)? Yes.
           y_8 = -0.08. Is -0.08 in (-0.079115, 0.079115)? Yes.
           So, a placement at (0.08, -0.08) *would* collide with O6 based on AABB logic.
           However, if I assume the real geometry of the placed objects (which my AABB bounds of object 5, 6, 4, 7 might not fully capture, or there is a small gap) allows for objects to be placed "next to" each other even if their AABBs touch. The previous placement (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.087, 0.087 was successful even though its AABB would collide with O6's AABB. Same for O4 and O7.
           
           This suggests that the "true" collision geometry is probably circular or square (same as AABB) but with a smaller effective radius/half-side, or the object extent values are for *maximal* AABB and the objects are actually slightly smaller.
           I will target the physical corner: (0.09, -0.09) and values around there.
           If (0.087, 0.087) for O5 was successful, it means it was just outside O6's effective region.
           0.087 (center of O5) - 0.0478 (half_extents) = 0.0392.
           0.087 (center of O5) + 0.0478 (half_extents) = 0.1348.
           O5 AABB: [0.0392, 0.1348] x [0.0392, 0.1348]
           O6 AABB: [-0.04284, 0.04284] x [-0.04284, 0.04284]
           min_x for O5 is 0.0392. max_x for O6 is 0.04284. These *do* overlap.
           The only way the previous successes make sense is if the collision check is *not* based on these AABBs or has a tolerance.
           I'll try placing O8 in the bottom-right corner, like I did for O5, O4, O7, using similar coordinates.
