           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.189, -0.401), (0.266, -0.324)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.197, 0.517, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.693, 0.721).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.254, -0.219, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.061, 0.998).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.204, 0.243, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.656, 0.755).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.228, -0.362, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.744, 0.668).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.16, 0.481), (0.233, 0.554)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.293, -0.258), (-0.215, -0.18)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.244, 0.204), (-0.165, 0.283)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is to place objects v8, v12, v14, and v16 on object v18. Currently, all these objects are on object v11, which appears to be a large table (given its AABB coordinates). Object v18 has a small AABB, indicating it could be a smaller container or surface. Since the only available action is `move_base` from v3 to v3, which has no effect other than incurring cost, and there are no pick or place actions available, it is impossible to move any of the objects. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
