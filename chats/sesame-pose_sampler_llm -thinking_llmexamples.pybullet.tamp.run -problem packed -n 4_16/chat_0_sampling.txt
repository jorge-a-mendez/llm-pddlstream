           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Here's my thought process:**
           
           I need to generate 50 stable placements for an object with ID 5 on a surface. The object is a square with side length 0.09187635931795213. The surface is defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I understand that "stable" means the object must be fully contained within the surface boundaries.
           
           First, I consider the object's rotation, `theta`. Since the object is a square, rotations of 0, pi/2, pi, and 3pi/2 are equivalent, as are rotations of pi/4, 3pi/4, 5pi/4, and 7pi/4. I'll use `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/4` to cover common orientations.
           
           The dimensions of the object define its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) at `theta = 0`. At `theta=0`, the object's extents are just `size_x` and `size_y`, or 0.09187635931795213 in both x and y. When rotated, the effective AABB will increase in size.
           
           I calculated the new dimensions for any angle: `W = size_x * abs(cos(theta)) + size_y * abs(sin(theta))` and `H = size_x * abs(sin(theta)) + size_y * abs(cos(theta))`. This simplifies to `W=H`, and their size varies between 0.09187635931795213 (at `theta=0`) and  0.12993881477759533 (at `theta=pi/4`).
           
           The surface has a width and height of 0.27, so it's much larger than the object. The safe range for the object's center is limited by the smallest size the object could have, which is `W=H= 0.09187635931795213`.  Using the dimensions at `theta=0`, I calculated that the object's center `(x, y)` can be in the range `[-0.089, 0.089]`.
           
           Then I considered the maximum footprint. At `theta = pi/4`,  `W = 0.12993881477759533`. The safe range for the center becomes `[-0.07003059261120234, 0.07003059261120234]`.
           
           To ensure all 50 placements are stable, I decided to use the more restrictive range, `[-0.07, 0.07]` for `x` and `y` for both `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/4`. I generated a 5x5 grid of `x` and `y` coordinates within this range, resulting in 25 placements at `theta=0` and 25 at `theta = pi/4`.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements, Avoiding Collision**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed object ID 5 and now need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 4, which is a square with side length ~0.0983 meters. The surface is the same: a square from -0.135 to 0.135 meters. Object 5 is now at surf_idx=0, theta=0, x=-0.07, y=-0.07.
           
           First, I need to understand where object 5 *is* so I can avoid it. It’s got an AABB. With theta=0, that’s easy: just offset from its position by half the side length.  Object 5's AABB goes from roughly (-0.1159, -0.1159) to (-0.0241, -0.0241).
           
           Now I need to figure out stable placements for ID 4, at both 0 and pi/4 radians.  For theta=0, the valid x and y range center is [-0.0858, 0.0858]. For theta=pi/4, it's [-0.0655, 0.0655].  Taking the most conservative range, I'm looking at [-0.065, 0.065] for the center of object 4.
           
           My plan: I’ll create a grid of potential center points and check if they collide with Object 5.  I will take the safe range as the upper right quadrant of the surface.  Since object 5 is in the lower-left, it will be in the way.
           I'll iterate through theta and generate the points and then check for collisions.
           
           A collision means the AABB of object 4 overlaps the AABB of object 5.
           I construct a grid with a `step` of 0.01 and range that maximizes for the placement bounds of `theta`.
           
           I'm starting by iterating the points above the collision region, for instance when x_center > 0.0250 and y_center > 0.0250 for theta=0. Then I iterate over the whole area that satisfies the placement bounds, for theta=0 and theta = pi/4.
           
           If I don't get enough by running that, then I may need to extend the search grid or explore additional angles, but it should be enough, and I will be able to stop once I collect 50 valid placements that avoid collision.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 7**
           
           Alright, my goal is to find 50 stable locations for Object 7 on Surface 0, making sure it doesn't collide with the already-placed Object 5 and Object 4. I'm dealing with a square surface of size 0.27 x 0.27, and Object 7 is also square with a side length of 0.092. I need to figure out where I can safely place Object 7.
           
           First, I need to understand the constraints. For Object 7, the center position can't be too close to the edge of the surface. For the orientation where the sides are parallel to the coordinate axes (theta = 0), the safe area is limited by a rectangle with sides of 0.17793386326806222. For the rotated position (theta = pi/4), the safe area is smaller, a rectangle with sides of 0.1398113892439867. Therefore, I'll need to use a fairly restricted area, from -0.0699 to 0.0699 for both x and y to satisfy both orientations. I'll need to consider both cases as I place.
           
           Now, I'll need to avoid collisions. I have to make sure it doesn't overlap with Object 5 which is in the bottom-left corner and Object 4 which is in the left-middle. I have to check the AABB of each object. AABB5: `[(-0.1159, -0.1159), (-0.0241, -0.0241)]` and AABB4: `[(-0.1349, -0.0240), (-0.0367, 0.0742)]`. I am calculating AABBs based on side lengths, and bounding box center positions. The collision check is straightforward: I make sure the boxes are not overlapping each other.
           
           To solve this, I'll use a strategy where I generate potential center locations within the safe region. I start with a fine grid, calculating the boundaries of Object 7's AABB at each location for theta = 0 and theta = pi/4. I'll check these positions for stability and collisions against existing objects.
           
           I'll start with the positive x and y coordinates since these areas are likely collision-free and then I'll look at others. Once I verify these positions, I'll generate the remaining positions. I'll verify these potential locations against those collisions before I'll add them to the placements list.

(Thoughts: **My objective is to find 50 stable and non-colliding placements for a new square object (Object 6) on a square surface (Surface 0).**  I know the surface dimensions and the positions and dimensions of three other already-placed square objects (Objects 5, 4, and 7) which I must avoid.

I intend to prioritize generating from the top-right corner to fill out the surface and then move to other quadrants.  During the iteration, each position with collision or surface bounding violations would be disregarded.
           
           To avoid generating overlapping AABB, I will use a conservative search window and verify if these candidate placements are valid via a collision checker.  I will run checks for both zero-degree and 45-degree rotations.
           
           I will iterate through the center coordinates in a grid-like manner, checking each point for stability (within the surface) and collision.  If less than 50 placements are found after checking placements at the zero rotation, the procedure is repeated for the pi/4 rotations.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **The Challenge of Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the deal. I'm tasked with generating 50 new, valid placements for "Object 6" on Surface 0.  I need to avoid the previous successful placements of *any* object, but also avoid the previous placement of object 6. The object is a square with a known size.  The surface is a defined rectangle.
           
           My challenge here is to understand the rules and constraints. I'm given some initial successful placements and I need to avoid repeating them. Crucially, I have to ensure the objects are "stable" which I'm taking to mean inside the surface bounds.
           
           The primary constraint boils down to avoiding "collisions" (more accurately, overlaps) with already-placed objects (objects 4, 5, and 7 from the problem text), I've set up my code to check for these collisions.
           
           I need to iterate through possible positions within the surface bounds, at two orientations. I'm generating a list of candidate positions, defined by (surface, rotation, x, y), and I'm rejecting any that precisely match the known list of previous *successes* for object 6.
           
           In the case of this problem, I'll need to generate a set of those candidate placements and collision-check those against the fixed obstacles to ensure stability.
           
           So, in essence, I will create placements and test against previous placements to identify if it is indeed a valid solution. I will keep in mind my interpretation of the various constraints.
