User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is generally a square area defined by the bounding boxes 0 through 4, which form walls at x = +/- 2.5 and y = +/- 2.5. There's a central vertical wall (box 5) at x = 0. Many smaller obstacles are scattered throughout the scene. I need to find positions that are within 2 units of the target point `(0.1834164132808796, -0.6276133989397943)` while avoiding these fixed obstacles and considering potential future collisions.
           
           Given the target point `(0.1834164132808796, -0.6276133989397943)`, which is to the right of the central barrier (box 5), I will prioritize positions on the right side of the x-axis, or close to the x-axis, to ensure line of sight.
           
           1.  **Directly to the right of the target:** A position `(2.1834164132808796, -0.6276133989397943)` is at max_range from the target and likely to have a clear view given the target's negative y-coordinate and the relative lack of obstacles in the lower right quadrant.
           2.  **Slightly below and to the right of the target:** A position like `(1.5, -2.0)` would be within the allowed range and provide a different angle. It avoids the central barrier and fixed obstacles 16 and 17.
           3.  **To the upper right of the target:** A position around `(1.5, 0.5)` would also be within range and offer a different perspective. It should avoid the central barrier.
           
           Positions:
           (2.1834164132808796 -0.6276133989397943)
           (1.5 -2.0)
           (1.5 0.5)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     My apologies, it seems I made a critical error in the previous request by using the wrong target point. The target point provided in the *previous request's failure logs* was `(-2.027146816253662, 2.043081760406494)`, while I was using `(0.1834164132808796, -0.6276133989397943)` which was for a completely different target. This led to all positions failing due to no line of sight. I will ensure to use the correct target point moving forward.
           
           The *new* target point for this request is `(0.1834164132808796, -0.6276133989397943)`.
           
           Given this target point, which is to the right of the central barrier (box 5) and in the lower half of the scene, I need to find positions within 2 units.
           
           1.  **Directly to the right of the target:** A position like `(1.5, -1.0)` is close to the target, avoids the central barrier, and seems clear of smaller obstacles in that region.
           2.  **Slightly below the target:** A position `(0.0, -2.0)` would be directly below the central barrier, but to the right of obstacle 16 and within range. It could provide a clear view looking upwards.
           3.  **To the upper right of the target, near the max range:** A position like `(1.0, 1.0)` is still within the `max_range` of 2 from `(0.18, -0.62)`, specifically `sqrt((1-0.18)^2 + (1 - (-0.62))^2) = sqrt(0.82^2 + 1.62^2) = sqrt(0.6724 + 2.6244) = sqrt(3.2968) approx 1.815`, which is less than 2. This position avoids the central barrier and the upper obstacles.
           
           Positions:
           (1.5 -1.0)
           (0.0 -2.0)
           (1.0 1.0)

Model:     My sincerest apologies. It appears I made the same mistake again and used an incorrect target point in the previous iteration. I am truly sorry for this oversight. I need to be much more careful with the target point provided in the *current* request, not from the failure logs of previous requests.
           
           The *current* target point is `(-2.027146816253662, 2.043081760406494)`. All the previous positions failed because they were trying to view a different target.
           
           Let's re-evaluate based on the *correct* target `(-2.027146816253662, 2.043081760406494)`. This target point is in the upper-left quadrant of the scene.
           
           1.  **Directly below the target:** A position like `(-2.0, 0.5)` is within max_range 2 (approx `sqrt((-2 - (-2.027))^2 + (0.5 - 2.043)^2) = sqrt(0.027^2 + (-1.543)^2) = sqrt(0.000729 + 2.380849) = sqrt(2.381578) approx 1.54`), and should have a clear view looking upwards. It's also far from the central barrier (box 5). We need to watch out for obstacles in the upper left: 6, 8, 11, 12, 18, 21. `(-2.0, 0.5)` seems to be clear of these.
           2.  **To the right of the target (but still left of the central barrier):** A position like `(-1.0, 2.0)` is close to the target (approx `sqrt((-1 - (-2.027))^2 + (2 - 2.043)^2) = sqrt(1.027^2 + (-0.043)^2) = sqrt(1.054729 + 0.001849) = sqrt(1.056578) approx 1.02`), and should have a clear view. This needs to avoid obstacles 11, 18, 13, 14, 20, which are in this region. This position is close to 14, so I need to be careful.
           3.  **Below and to the left of the target:** A position like `(-2.3, -0.5)` is further from the target (approx `sqrt((-2.3 - (-2.027))^2 + (-0.5 - 2.043)^2) = sqrt((-0.273)^2 + (-2.543)^2) = sqrt(0.074529 + 6.466849) = sqrt(6.541378) approx 2.55`), which is outside the max_range of 2. Let's try `(-2.0, 0.0)` instead. This is still within limits and provides a different angle, avoiding known obstacles in the upper-left. (`sqrt((-2 - (-2.027))^2 + (0.0 - 2.043)^2) = sqrt(0.027^2 + (-2.043)^2) = sqrt(0.000729 + 4.173849) = sqrt(4.174578) approx 2.04`, which is slightly over 2.
           
           Let's refine the third point to be `(-1.5, 1.0)`. This position is within range (approx `sqrt((-1.5 - (-2.027))^2 + (1.0 - 2.043)^2) = sqrt(0.527^2 + (-1.043)^2) = sqrt(0.277729 + 1.087849) = sqrt(1.365578) approx 1.16`) and offers a good perspective. This is to the right of obstacle 12 and below 14.
           
           Positions:
           (-2.0 0.5)
           (-1.0 2.0)
           (-1.5 1.0)

Model:     My apologies once again for the repeated error in handling the target point. It's clear I am not processing the `Target point: {target_point}` from the *current* request properly, instead relying on the target point from the previous *failed* request or the initial example. I need to explicitly parse the target point from the *current* request.
           
           The *current* target point is `(0.5777165293693542, 2.040435314178467)`.
           From the failure logs:
           - `(1.5, -1.0)` collided with box 17: `((1.21389662972716, -0.9095388675567755), (1.3285552287933478, -0.7948802684905878))`
           - `(0.0, -2.0)` collided with box 5: `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))` (central wall)
           - `(1.0, 1.0)` collided with box 15: `((1.0884555976494805, 1.0500183503731744), (1.1963623363867744, 1.1579250891104682))`
           
           The target point `(0.5777165293693542, 2.040435314178467)` is in the upper-right quadrant, just to the right of the central barrier (box 5). Many small obstacles are around y=2 in this region (boxes 9, 10, 20, 22).
           
           1.  **Directly below the target:** A position `(0.5, 0.5)` is within range (approx `sqrt((0.5-0.577)^2 + (0.5-2.04)^2) = sqrt((-0.077)^2 + (-1.54)^2) = sqrt(0.0059 + 2.3716) = sqrt(2.3775) approx 1.54`). This position is below many of the upper obstacles and to the right of the central barrier.
           2.  **To the right of the target:** A position `(2.0, 2.0)` is close to the target (approx `sqrt((2.0-0.577)^2 + (2.0-2.04)^2) = sqrt(1.423^2 + (-0.04)^2) = sqrt(2.0249 + 0.0016) = sqrt(2.0265) approx 1.42`). This should avoid obstacles near the central barrier and those directly left of the target. It's also near box 7 and 19 so careful there. Let's try `(2.2, 1.0)`. Distance to target is `sqrt((2.2-0.577)^2 + (1.0-2.04)^2) = sqrt(1.623^2 + (-1.04)^2) = sqrt(2.634 + 1.0816) = sqrt(3.7156) approx 1.92`. This should avoid obstacles in the upper left.
           3.  **To the left of the target, but not crossing the central barrier:** A position like `(-0.5, 1.5)` could be promising. Distance to target is `sqrt((-0.5-0.577)^2 + (1.5-2.04)^2) = sqrt((-1.077)^2 + (-0.54)^2) = sqrt(1.16 + 0.2916) = sqrt(1.4516) approx 1.2`. This is to the left of the central barrier, so it depends on the target's visibility *through* the central barrier. Since the central barrier is a wall, this position will likely fail.
           
           Let's stick to the right side of the central barrier.
           
           Revised attempt for 3 positions on the right side of the central barrier:
           
           1.  **(0.5, 0.5)** (Calculated distance: 1.54) - Below the target, to the right of the central barrier. Seems clear of known obstacles.
           2.  **(2.2, 1.0)** (Calculated distance: 1.92) - To the lower-right of the target. Seems clear of known obstacles.
           3.  **(1.5, 2.0)** (Calculated distance: `sqrt((1.5-0.577)^2 + (2.0-2.04)^2) = sqrt(0.923^2 + (-0.04)^2) = sqrt(0.852 + 0.0016) = sqrt(0.8536) approx 0.92`) - To the right of the target. This position is close to the y=2.0 line and avoids obstacle 15. Also avoids 7 and 19.
           
           Positions:
           (0.5 0.5)
           (2.2 1.0)
           (1.5 2.0)
