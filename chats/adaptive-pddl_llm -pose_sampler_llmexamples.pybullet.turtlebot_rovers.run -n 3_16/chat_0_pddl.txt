User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with dimensions approximately 5x5 units, centered at the origin. There's a vertical wall in the middle (obstacle 5) and several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the space. The target point is (0.8, -0.9). I need to find positions within a radius of 4 from this point, but also within the room's x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5] limits. This means the robot must be in the room.
           
           Considering the target is at (0.8, -0.9), it's in the bottom-right quadrant, just to the right of the central vertical wall (obstacle 5). Many of the obstacles are in the top-left and top-right quadrants, with a few in the bottom-left. Obstacle 15 is near the target, but its small. I will try to place the robot on different sides of the target, considering the room boundaries and the central wall. I'll also try to keep a safe distance from the central wall and the other small obstacles. Since the target is to the right of the central wall, positions to the right of the central wall (x > 0.05) are generally more promising, but I will try a few positions to the left of the central wall to maximize diversity.
