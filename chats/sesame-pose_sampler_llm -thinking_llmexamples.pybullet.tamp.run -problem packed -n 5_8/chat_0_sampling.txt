(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object 7**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 7 on surface 0. This is a fairly straightforward problem. Object 7 is essentially a small square (0.0937 x 0.0937) and surface 0 is a larger square (0.27 x 0.27) centered at (0,0). The objective is to ensure each object is fully contained within the surface.
           
           First, I'll calculate the valid area for axis-aligned placements (theta = 0).  Given the object's dimensions, I can easily determine the inset from the surface edges. This results in a valid placement area roughly [-0.088, 0.088] by [-0.088, 0.088]. I will generate a 7x7 grid (49 placements) using this area, which will give me a 0.029 step in both x and y.
           
           For the 50th placement, I'll introduce some diversity with a 45-degree rotation (theta = pi/4).  I’ll need to adjust my calculations for the reduced available area for this rotation due to the diagonal placement. The maximum rotation extent is sqrt(2)/2 * object_side_length which is about 0.066. My calculation will give the valid x and y range as [-0.06874, 0.06874]. The center point (0, 0) is a reasonable choice for the rotated placement.
           
           All the placements are on surface 0.
           
           So, the strategy will look something like this: Generate a 7x7 grid of placements in the axis-aligned orientation and pick the center for the rotated placement.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Avoiding Collisions**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a task: place object 8, a square with dimensions around 0.095, on a surface without hitting object 7, which is already successfully placed. I know object 7's AABB (bounding box) and its position, and I need to avoid it.
           
           First, I figured out the AABB of object 7, centered at (-0.088155, -0.088155), which takes up a space in x from around -0.135 to -0.0413 and y from around -0.135 to -0.0413.
           
           Next, I determined the available space for object 8. I need 50 non-colliding placements. Object 8 is unrotated (theta = 0), and has AABB boundaries are calculated based on surface bounds and object 8's size. Given the previous placement of Object 7 in the bottom-left corner of the surface, any placements in the bottom-left are going to collide. Object 8, therefore, needs to be placed to the right or above Object 7.
           
           I used a grid search for Object 8's center and excluded any placements that overlapped with object 7's AABB. I also used rotation (theta = pi/4) as well as the initial (theta = 0) configuration. I used the center points I determined to create a grid of unrotated placements that didn't collide.
           
           I then did the same for rotations of `pi/4` and also created a grid to find placements within the available bounds that don't collide.
           
           I then created a grid of center points using both methods (rotation and no-rotation). By combining these two configurations, and using grid-based centers that didn't collide, I was able to generate 49 valid placement candidates.
           
           For the final placement (50th), I chose a center point and a small rotation, calculated effective half-extents. By calculation of boundaries, I verified that this last placement was in a valid range.
           
           Therefore, this process has given me 50 viable placements for object 8.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 4**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for object 4 on surface 0, while avoiding collisions with objects 7 and 8.  First, I've calculated the safe, collision-free region for object 4 with no rotation. I determine that the valid x and y range are [-0.099217, 0.099217]. Next I establish a 7x7 grid and iterate each position on the grid. To verify, I check the overlap between the bounding box of object 4 at each position on the grid with the bounding boxes of objects 7 and 8 to ensure no collisions occur, using the overlap formula.  This grid will yield 28 collision-free placements (theta=0).  I will check positions on surface 0 using theta = pi/4 and a 5x5 grid yielding a total of 15 positions. To complete the 50, I've selected the 7 locations where x = 0 and changing the rotation to theta = pi/2 will satisfy the position checks as well. The 50 final placements are:

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for a New Object**
           
           Okay, I've got a task: place a new object (ID 5) on Surface 0, ensuring 50 stable placements while avoiding collisions with objects 7, 8, and 4. Here's my thought process:
           
           1.  **Understand the Space:** I'm dealing with a rectangular surface (-0.135 to 0.135 in both X and Y). Existing objects 7, 8, and 4 are already placed, and I have their sizes and placements, including their AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes).
           
           2.  **Define Collision:** To avoid collisions, the new object's AABB cannot overlap with the AABBs of objects 7, 8, or 4.
           
           3.  **Calculate Effective Half-Extents:** For simplicity, I'll initially treat object 5 as a square. I calculated its half-extents (hx\_5, hy\_5), which are important for determining the placement bounds and collision checks. These half-extents are dependent on the rotation of the object.
           
           4.  **Consider Rotations and Placement Strategies:** I'll explore placements at different angles (theta). Initially, I'm focusing on theta = 0 (no rotation) and theta = pi/4 (45 degrees rotation). The effective half-extents will change with rotation.
           
           5.  **Calculate Valid Placement Area:** For a given rotation, I calculate the stable area for object 5 on surface 0, taking into account the effective half-extents. The bounds of this area are adjusted to account for the object size, making sure the entire object fits within the surface.
           
           6.  **Collision Avoidance (Theta=0):** To find collision-free placements, I need to check potential (x, y) coordinates within the valid placement area. I can do this by creating a grid or sampling points.
               *   For each (x, y) point: Calculate the object's AABB.
               *   Check for overlap between the new AABB and existing AABBs.
               *   If no overlap, this is a valid placement.
           
           7.  **Generate a Grid and Filter Collisions:** I'll create a 7x7 grid (49 points) covering the valid placement area. For each grid point, I check for collision. This means, checking the object's (x, y) AABB against all existing object AABBs for X/Y overlap.
           
           8.  **Strategy for Theta = Pi/4:** For theta=pi/4, the effective size will be different, so the valid area needs to be recalculated. I will create a 5x5 grid (25 points) and repeat the collision filtering.
           
           9.  **Iterate and Fill the Placement List:** I'll go through the various rotations and use my AABB overlap logic with the grid. I'm aiming for 35 placements at theta=0 and 15 at theta=pi/4, for a total of 50.
           
           10. **Fallback Rotations:** If I still don't have enough valid placements, I might try other angles, such as theta=pi/2 or slightly tilted angles and repeat the process.
           
           11. **Verification of the Logic:** I've done a quick test of the placement with the (0.085530, 0.085530) location, manually testing the collision against the AABBs. This confirms my approach. I'll continue filling out the list until I reach the required number of valid, non-colliding placements.

           8.  **Strategy for Theta = Pi/4:** For theta=pi/4, the effective size will be different, so the valid area needs to be recalculated. I will create a 5x5 grid (25 points) and repeat the collision filtering.
           
           9.  **Iterate and Fill the Placement List:** I'll go through the various rotations and use my AABB overlap logic with the grid. I'm aiming for 35 placements at theta=0 and 15 at theta=pi/4, for a total of 50.
           
           10. **Fallback Rotations:** If I still don't have enough valid placements, I might try other angles, such as theta=pi/2 or slightly tilted angles and repeat the process.
           
           11. **Verification of the Logic:** I've done a quick test of the placement with the (0.085530, 0.085530) location, manually testing the collision against the AABBs. This confirms my approach. I'll continue filling out the list until I reach the required number of valid, non-colliding placements.
           

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Stable Placements for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 50 stable positions for this new object (ID 6) on surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into the existing objects (IDs 7, 8, 4, and 5).  I've got the surface dimensions and the object's size and shape (effectively square).  The main challenge is avoiding those existing AABB-defined obstacles, which form a sort of "L" shape in the bottom-left of the surface.
           
           I started by defining the stable region for object 6, figuring out the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates where I *could* place it without going over the surface bounds. Then, I needed to figure out where there are no collisions.
           
           I've got this systematic approach where, for each potential placement (x, y) and rotation angle (theta) of object 6, I calculate its AABB.  Then, I compare this proposed AABB against the AABBs of each existing object.  If any overlap occurs, it's a collision, and that position is rejected.  I'm using a grid-based approach.
           
           I've tested the cases for `theta = 0`, `pi/4`, and `pi/2`.  It's clear that the area on the left and bottom-left will be crowded.  The area to the right is mostly free.  The script generates potential placements and then validates them.  It then keeps adding to placements with a new angle.  Finally, I have picked the first 50 stable, non-colliding positions.
