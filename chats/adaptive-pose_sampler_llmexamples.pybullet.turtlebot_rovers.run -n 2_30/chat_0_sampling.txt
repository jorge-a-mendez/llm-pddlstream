User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is defined by a set of axis-aligned bounding boxes. Many of these appear to be outer walls or room dividers, such as boxes 0-4 which form a large square. Box 5 appears to be a vertical divider in the center of the room. There are also smaller boxes that seem to be obstacles on tables or on the floor.
           
           Given the target point (-0.8931481525046294 -1.3831872167732007), I need to find 3 base positions within a distance of 2 from it. I will try to find positions that are not too close to the known obstacles.
           
           The target is in the bottom-left quadrant. Boxes 6 and 15 are in this quadrant, so I should be careful to avoid them. Boxes 17 is also near the target.
           
           I will try to place the robot on different sides of the target to ensure diversity and to avoid potential occlusions not explicitly defined by the AABBs.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     The target point is now (2.0947039127349854, 2.173489570617676). My previous attempts failed because they were too far from the target or collided with an obstacle. The previous target was in the bottom-left quadrant, and the new target is in the top-right quadrant. The previous positions were based on the old target.
           
           The new target point is in the top-right quadrant, close to the wall. Boxes 7, 19, and 20 are in this quadrant. Boxes 1, 3 are also walls near the target. I need to be careful to avoid collisions and ensure line-of-sight. The central divider (box 5) is at x=0, which is far from this target.
           
           The previous failed positions for the *old* target were:
           1. (-0.8931481525046294 -0.3831872167732007) - no line of sight
           2. (-1.8931481525046294 -1.3831872167732007) - no line of sight
           3. (0.1068518474953706 -1.3831872167732007) - collided with box 5 (the central divider)
           
           These failures are for the old target, so I will generate completely new positions relative to the new target. Since the target is in the top-right corner, I should try to place the robot closer to it and from directions that are likely to have line-of-sight. I should also be mindful of the outer wall (box 3) and inner obstacles like box 7.
