(Thoughts: **My Placement Strategy for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, I need to generate 50 stable placements for object ID 5, a 0.07 x 0.07 square, on surface 0, defined by the points (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0).  Since I have no prior information (no obstacles, no placed objects), I'll adopt a systematic approach to explore the valid placement space.
           
           First, I calculate the allowable center coordinates for the object, ensuring it remains fully contained within the surface. The surface dimensions are 0.6 x 0.6.  Considering the object's dimensions, the center can range from (4.235, -0.565) to (4.765, -0.035).
           
           To efficiently cover this space and vary the object's orientation, I'll use a grid-like placement strategy.  I'll place objects on a 5x5 grid, resulting in 25 initial placements. To add orientation I'll use theta = 0 and theta = pi/2 for each point. Resulting in 25 * 2 = 50 placements. I'll evenly space the x and y coordinates within the allowable ranges. This should provide good initial coverage.
           
           Here's how I calculated the x and y coordinates:
           
           *   **x\_coords:** `4.235, 4.3675, 4.5, 4.6325, 4.765`
           *   **y\_coords:** `-0.565, -0.4325, -0.3, -0.1675, -0.035`
           
           So I generate placements in the format (surf_idx, theta, x, y), I'll start with all the combinations of x and y with theta = 0, then generate the combinations with theta = pi/2 to complete the 50 total.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Generating Placement Candidates for Object ID 10**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new request for object ID 10. Good news, object ID 5 was successfully placed before, with no collisions at the coordinates `(0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565)`. I'll keep that in mind for future requests or placements that might interact with ID 5. But for this one, I'm starting fresh with ID 10.
           
           First things first, it's a square object, with dimensions `0.09658427818145121 x 0.09658427818145121`. I've got a target surface, a `0.6 x 0.6` square defined by the coordinates `0: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. To be fully contained, the center needs to be at least half the object's width, which is `0.0482921390907256`, away from each edge.
           
           That gives me a valid center range of `[4.248, 4.751]` for the x-coordinate and `[-0.551, -0.048]` for the y-coordinate. I need to generate 50 placement candidates. Since this is the first time I'm placing this object, I don't need to worry about collisions with other objects yet.
           
           I'll use a grid-based approach, like before. The x-range is approximately 0.503 units and the y-range is also 0.503 units.  I'll use a 5x5 grid again. The step size for x and y will be 0.125.  I'll start at coordinates (4.248, -0.551). Finally, to mix things up a bit, I'll use 0 and pi/2 radians as orientation. Even though it's square, varying the orientation is good practice. Now, let's generate those candidates and check for collisions.
