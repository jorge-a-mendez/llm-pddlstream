(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements for Object ID 6 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, I've got this. The goal is to find 50 stable placements for an object (ID 6, dimensions: 0.082273 x 0.082273) on a square surface (Surface 0) bounded by (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135).  This is the first request, so no prior placements or collision data to consider.
           
           I need to make sure the object remains entirely within the surface's boundaries, regardless of its rotation.  Since it's a square, its effective bounding box size changes depending on its rotation. I've defined the half-extents to calculate the amount to subtract from the bounds (w/2 * |cos| + h/2 * |sin|).
           
           The maximum possible bounding box dimensions when rotated at 45 degrees, which gives me  `obj_side * sqrt(2) /2`. For a general rotation, I'll be using this with the sum of cos and sin. To be sure it fits, I’m generating bounding boxes for a bunch of angles and checking the boundaries.
           
           I plan to position the object at various angles: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2. For each angle, I will position the center, making sure the object’s AABB fits inside the bounds. To ensure diversity, I'll generate a grid of positions with some added random ones in the valid range.
           
           For each angle, I am calculating `effective_half_side`. Then I can establish the max and min coordinates. I'm taking a conservative margin to ensure stability.
           
           So, I'm going to create a grid of positions for these angles and then add a few more for added diversity. The process appears simple, but I will double-check the logic.
           I’m generating a grid of the form of -8, 0, 8 for each X/Y dimension. Then I can add one point in the center of the surface.
           Given all the calculations, here is the list of placements. All these points will be placed on surface `surf_idx = 0`.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement and Collision Avoidance**
           
           Okay, so I've received a request to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0, and the tricky part is avoiding a collision with the already placed object ID 6.  Object 6 is square, and its dimensions and position are known: it's at (-0.09, -0.09).  My main objective here is to prevent an overlap between these objects.
           
           First, I defined the surface bounds and size of both objects. For object 5, which is also a square, I calculated its side length (obj5_s) and half-extent (half_obj5_s). My approach is to consider different rotations (theta) for object 5 and place the object at various locations around the surface to find safe spots. I need to make sure I consider the collision between the two objects.
           
           I've determined that the safe placement for each angle (theta) requires me to keep the candidate object 5's AABB from overlapping with object 6's AABB.  This collision test involves comparing the minimum and maximum extents of each object along the x and y axes. I know that for a collision to occur, there must be at least one overlap on any two axes between the two objects. I'll take a grid approach in various angles and test the positions against the collision conditions.
           
           I'll be generating 50 candidate placements. To do this, I set up a grid for x and y locations for different angles (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2).  For each angle, I calculate the effective half-extent of the rotated square.  Then, I'll calculate the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates for object 5, and then check those against the coordinate bounds for object 6, which is located in the bottom-left corner of the surface.  This prevents any overlap with object 6.
           
           To avoid collisions with object 6, I defined a rule: the center of object 5 must not fall within an AABB created by object 6 plus the half-extent of the rotated object 5. So, for my candidate locations, I will use a series of x and y placements to ensure that these locations are safe from collisions and fall inside the given surface.
           
           During my testing, I found that calculating the AABB of the rotated objects is crucial for collision testing. I've re-written my tests, and I'm ensuring no intersection, and testing with the updated code.
           After generating, I will return the list with object ID, rotation (theta), x and y for these 50 placements.

(Thoughts: **Automated Object Placement Strategy**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable locations for a new square object (ID 4, side 0.0788) on a surface (surface 0, bounded by -0.135 and 0.135). The critical challenge is avoiding collisions with two existing, immovable square objects (Object 6, size 0.0822 at position (-0.09, -0.09), and Object 5, size 0.0867 at position (-0.09, 0)).
           
           To tackle this, I'll first define the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for all objects, essentially establishing their occupied regions.  I'll then strategically generate candidate placements (surface index, rotation angle 'theta', x, y coordinates) for the new object.
           
           For each candidate, I'll calculate its AABB, accounting for the effect of rotation. I will also take the effective half side length (`half_s_eff`) of the new object to determine how far its center can be from the edges of surface 0, and from the existing objects, without a collision.
           
           I'll reject any candidate that:
           
           1.  Places the new object outside the surface 0 boundaries.
           2.  Results in an AABB overlap (collision) with Object 6.
           3.  Results in an AABB overlap (collision) with Object 5.
           
           I'll use a systematic approach, using a grid of x and y coordinates at different rotation angles. The rotation angles are set at 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, and pi/2. I'll precalculate the necessary offsets.
           
           The core collision check will use this logic: If any part of the candidate object's AABB extends into the existing object's AABB, there's a collision, and the candidate is invalid.
           
           I'll then generate a grid of potential x and y positions for the object's center for each angle, and check.
