User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The environment is bounded by a square from -2.5 to 2.5 in both x and y. There's a vertical wall at x=0. The scene contains several small obstacles. I will try to find positions for the robot by moving around the target point in a circle with a radius, and checking if they are within the bounds and not colliding with any of the fixed obstacles. Since I need to return 3 positions, I will try to spread them out around the target point.
           
           Positions:
           (0.0 0.0)
           (1.0 1.0)
           (-1.0 1.0)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point is (-0.545, 1.869). The previous positions (0.0, 0.0) collided with the wall at x=0 and other obstacles. (1.0, 1.0) and (-1.0, 1.0) were "not reachable", which implies they might have been outside the max_range of 2 from the target point. I need to be more careful about the distance.
           
           I will try positions with a radius of approximately 1.5 from the target point to ensure they are within the max_range of 2. I'll also try to keep them away from the central wall at x=0, and other obstacles. The target is in the upper-left quadrant.
           
           Positions:
           (-1.5 1.5)
           (-0.5 0.5)
           (-2.0 2.0)

Model:     The new target point is (1.872, 1.832). My previous attempts were based on the old target point. For the new target, my previous proposals of (-1.5, 1.5), (-0.5, 0.5) had no line of sight, which is expected since the target is now on the right side of the x=0 wall, and these positions are on the left. (-2.0, 2.0) collided with obstacle 8.
           
           The target is in the upper right quadrant. I need to find positions that are also in the upper right quadrant to ensure line of sight, and stay clear of the fixed obstacles, especially obstacle 7 at ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) which is very close to the target. I will try to place the robot in a circle around the target with a radius of around 1.5 to 1.8.

           (1.0 2.5)
