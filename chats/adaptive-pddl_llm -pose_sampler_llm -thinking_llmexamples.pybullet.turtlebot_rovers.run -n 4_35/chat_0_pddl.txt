           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable: A Deep Dive into the Impossibility of Achieving `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This goal breaks down into two key subgoals: achieving `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` for various objects. The process begins by examining the initial state for the necessary conditions to achieve this final goal.
           
           The initial examination quickly shows that many of the essential preconditions are met. However, the plan depends on the ability of two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, to successfully capture images and perform analyses. To this end, I will attempt to apply a sequence of actions.
           
           The strategy involves two actions that rely on moving around specific configurations, which are defined in the problem to be `imagevisible` or `comvisible` facts, as well as `ray` facts. I also have `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`, actions that depend on my rovers being in the right configuration.
           
           Unfortunately, a closer look at the available `move` action reveals an insurmountable hurdle. The available `move` actions are self-referential: they indicate that each rover can *only* move from its current configuration to the *same* configuration. The rover `v14` starts at `atconf(v14, v15)` and can only move to itself. It cannot change its configuration.
           
           To accomplish `receivedimage`, I'd need to first calibrate the rover, then take an image, then send the image. However, to complete the calibrate step, the rover needs to be in a configuration that will work with `imagevisible` facts. Similarly, the `sample_rock` action depends on a similar `atconf` requirement from the `above` predicate, while `send_analysis` requires the rover be in a configuration that works with the `comvisible` predicates.
           
           The same issues arise with `receivedanalysis`, since I have the same `atconf` limitation.
           
           Therefore, since the rovers are unable to change configurations using the available actions, it's impossible to satisfy all the conditions necessary for either `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`. Consequently, it's not possible to generate a valid plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, as my rovers are effectively stuck in their initial configurations.
