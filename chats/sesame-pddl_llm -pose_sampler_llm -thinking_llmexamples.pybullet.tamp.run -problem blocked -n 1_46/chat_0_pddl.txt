(Thoughts: **Object Placement on a Surface: A Detailed Strategy**
           
           My objective is to determine 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5) with dimensions 0.07 x 0.07 on a defined surface. This surface, identified as surface 0, is a rectangle defined by the coordinates ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  Essentially, I need to find the feasible area within which the object can be centered while remaining entirely within the surface boundaries.
           
           First, I calculate the available space on the surface. The surface has a width of 0.6 and a height of 0.6. Since the object's dimensions are also 0.07 x 0.07, its bounding box will be identical regardless of rotation.  The center of the object must stay at least half of the object width/height away from each edge. This creates an inner rectangle within the surface where the object's center can be.
           
           This leads to defining the valid x-range as [4.235, 4.765] and the valid y-range as [-0.565, -0.035]. The width of both these ranges is 0.53. To generate 50 distinct placements, I am employing a grid-based approach. I am using a grid with dimensions 8x7, yielding 56 points, and truncating to the first 50. 
           
           I set the step size for the x-coordinate to 0.53 / 7 and for the y-coordinate to 0.53 / 6. The object's AABB doesn't change with rotation, so the 'theta' values, rotation, are chosen in order to diversify the placements' orientations for generality. I have used a list of eight different angles [0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi, 5pi/4, 3pi/2, 7pi/4].  I iterate to generate a list of 50 tuples, each defining a placement by surface index, theta, x-coordinate, and y-coordinate. Finally, I confirm the number of generated placements as expected.

(Thoughts: **Effective AABB and Stable Placements for Rotated Squares**
           
           Okay, so I've got this new object, ID 10, which is also a square, and I need to place it 50 times on a surface. The key is to ensure "stable" placements, meaning the rotated object's bounding box stays *entirely* within the surface.  I've learned from the previous feedback on object ID 5 that rotation significantly affects this, especially for squares. If I'm given the dimensions, I need to account for this.
           
           The important thing is that the feedback from before, with object 5, showed that at rotations that aren't multiples of pi/2, the AABB expands. So, I need to adjust my calculations to account for this, especially since the given `size_x` and `size_y` represent the AABB before rotation.
           
           For a square of side *s* rotated by an angle *theta*, the effective AABB dimensions are no longer simply *s*. Instead, I must use `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))` to calculate the dimensions. So, I must use this formula. For a square, I can further simplify this for easier use in code. 
           
           Given the surface boundaries, I need to calculate the allowable range for the object's center based on the *rotated* effective AABB.  This is the most conservative approach.  The biggest worry is making sure that I handle rotations, as the x and y bounds shrink when rotated.
           
           I'm thinking I'll generate the placements with a mix of different rotations. I'm going to carefully pick those rotations to ensure a good range. Then, I need to determine the maximum effective bounding box size for this square. Then, for each, I'm going to then calculate the valid range for the center (x, y) coordinates of the object.  I'm aiming for about 12-13 placements per rotation, to create a systematic, diverse set of stable placements. To ensure a good spread of rotations, I picked angles `0`, `pi/4`, `pi/2`, and `3pi/4`. This should capture all cases. The plan is to create 50 placements. I pre-calculated all of this information. I am careful to not place beyond the boundaries. I am not making placements which collide with non-fixed obstacles.
