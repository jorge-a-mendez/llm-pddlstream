           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning for Achieving `new-axiom@0()` in the `pr2-tamp` Domain**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which breaks down to achieving both `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.  I see that `type(v12, v17)` is already true, so that part's done. Now, the real challenge is making `on(v12, v18)` true.
           
           Looking at the `on` axiom, I need to make sure that there's a pose, let's call it `#p`, where `v12` is *supported* by `v18` and then that I also have `v12` *at* that pose, `#p`.
           
           Thankfully, the initial state gives me a head start:  `supported(v12, #p2, v18)` is already true! So, all I really need to do is get `v12` to `#p2`. Currently, `v12` is at `v13` because `atpose(v12, v13)` is true, and it's on `v14` as per `supported(v12, v13, v14)`.
           
           Therefore, the obvious plan becomes: **pick up `v12` from its current spot (v13) and then place it onto `v18` at pose `#p2`.**
           
           Now, I have to ensure that the actions will work.
           
           I analyzed the *initial state* and *robot* configurations.
           I have a list of *kinematic* and *base motion* facts.
           
           To do this, I'll need to use the `move_base`, `pick`, and `place` actions, and I need to select the most relevant base and arm motions from the kin and basemotion facts.
           
           First, I need to move the robot base from its current configuration (`v3`) to the base configuration required for picking up `v12` (`#q5`).
           
           Next, I'll use the `pick` action to pick `v12` using arm `v4` with grasp `#g2` from the current pose `v13` while the robot base is at `#q5`.
           
           Then, I'll move the robot base from `#q5` (where I'm at after the pick) to `#q4` (the base configuration needed for the placing action).
           
           Finally, I'll use the `place` action to place `v12` from arm `v4` at pose `#p2` onto `v18` with the same grasp `#g2`, while the robot base is at `#q4`.
           
           I examined all the *preconditions* and *effects* of each action and confirmed that each action's preconditions are satisfied, either by the initial state or by the effects of the preceding actions.
           
           Given the available action instances and the problem constraints, this plan should be executable. The specific trajectories (`#t12`, `#t10`, `#o0`, and `#t9`) come from the `basemotion` and `kin` facts, which I've checked to ensure exist and are compatible with the chosen actions.
           
           After executing this sequence, the robot *will* have moved `v12` to `v18`, with all the preconditions satisfied, which then satisfies the goal `new-axiom@0()`.
