           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the breakdown of the plan I've formulated to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()` in this PR2-TAMP domain:**
           
           First, I recognized that the `new-axiom@0()` goal boils down to ensuring both `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true. The initial state already provides `type(v12, v17)`, suggesting that `?green` should be instantiated as `v12`. Thus, my target becomes `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           To satisfy `on(v12, v18)`, I need to make both `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)` true. Examining the initial state, I found `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`.  This tells me that if `v12` is at pose `#o2`, the `on` axiom will be met. Currently, `v12` is at pose `v13`.
           
           Therefore, the core of the plan is to move `v12` from its current pose (`v13`) to the target pose (`#o2`). This will involve a `move_base` action followed by `pick` and `place` actions using the robot's arm (`v4`).
           
           To ensure the `pick` action's preconditions are met, I first need to move the robot's base configuration from its current state (`v3`) to a specific base configuration (`#o3`).  This leads to the first step of my plan: `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`. The initial state supports this move. After this action `atbconf(#o3)` is true which is a needed precondition for the `pick` action.
           
           With the base configuration correct, the next step is `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4`.  All preconditions for this action are met. Then I will execute `place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4` to place the block at the desired location.
           
           Executing these three actions in sequence should achieve the desired state: `atpose(v12, #o2)` which satisfies the `on(v12, v18)` goal, and since `type(v12, v17)` is already true, the overall `new-axiom@0()` goal is met.
           
           This three-step plan seems sound, efficient, and directly addresses the necessary preconditions and effects to successfully achieve the goal.
