           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's how I'm thinking about solving this stacking problem:**
           
           Okay, the goal is to get three objects (v8, v12, and v14) onto a target (v16).  I'm seeing that they're all currently on v11, and they're all *stackable* on v16.  This means I need to pick them up one at a time and place them.  I've got two arms, but only arm v4 seems to have the *kinematics* needed to move these objects according to the facts, and that's the only one I'll be using.
           
           I've got a bit of an issue right off the bat: The robot is currently at base configuration v3, and the pick-and-place actions will need a *different* base configuration, labeled #o3 in the facts.  So the first thing I'll need to do is move the base.
           
           Since I have pick and place actions available, and the goal is simply to achieve on(object, target), the only things I have to do is the following sequence of steps for each object:
           1.  Move base to the right position (#o3) if needed.
           2.  Pick up the object using the kin facts.
           3.  Place the object using the kin facts at the right spot on the target, v16.
           I'll iterate this process for each object.
           
           So, let's break it down:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  I move the base from v3 to #o3 using the `move_base` action.
           
           2.  **v14:**
               *   Pick v14 up from the starting position, where it's sitting on v11.
               *   Place v14 onto v16.
           
           3.  **v8:**
               *   Pick v8 up from the starting position.
               *   Place v8 onto v16.
           
           4.  **v12:**
               *   Pick v12 up from the starting position.
               *   Place v12 onto v16.
           
           Since I am assuming the negative `unsafe` predicates (like unsafepose and unsafeapproach) are *true* if not explicitly stated as false and I'm not shown any base motion failures or object interactions that will disrupt this, this plan should work perfectly. I am also making sure to re-establish `canmove()` after each move action so the sequence can continue. I check after each placement that on(object, v16) is indeed true, and if so then I'm happy to continue.
