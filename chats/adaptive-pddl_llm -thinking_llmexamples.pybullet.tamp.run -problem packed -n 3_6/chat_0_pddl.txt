           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Inability to Achieve the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a planning problem where I need to get three objects (v8, v12, and v14) onto a specific surface (v16) at a particular pose (#o2).  I've got the initial state, the goal state, and a very limited set of actions I can use. The goal boils down to ensuring these three objects are at pose #o2 while supported by the surface.
           
           I've examined the initial state and all the facts. Currently, all three objects are at their own poses and supported by v11. From the available facts, it's clear I can support them at the target surface, v16. However, I have a massive problem. The only available action I can execute is a null base motion action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This means that I can't actually *move* the objects to the target surface. My expert knowledge screams that I need `pick` and `place` actions to manipulate these objects. But I can't use them because the system has explicitly restricted me to use *only*  the given `move_base` action.
           
           The problem specifically says, "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." This means any actions to physically *move* an object like "pick" and "place" are out of bounds. The available facts *permit* the objects to be placed at the target locations, but the allowed actions provide no physical ability to achieve this.
           
           Therefore, since I can't change the `atpose` facts of the objects (i.e. move them to pose #o2 on the target surface), I cannot satisfy the goal of having them all "on" v16 (which requires they are both supported by v16 and at pose #o2).  This is an unsolvable plan with the constraints given. I have to report the goal is unreachable.
