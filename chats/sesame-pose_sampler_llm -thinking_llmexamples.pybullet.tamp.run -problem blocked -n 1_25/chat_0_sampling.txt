(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to find 50 stable placements for this object on surface 0.  First, the object's dimensions are (0.07, 0.07), making it a square.  Surface 0 is an AABB with the bounds ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  A "stable" placement means the object is *fully* inside the surface's boundaries.  Since this is a new object ID and surface, I'm assuming no collision information is available yet.
           
           Given the square object, I'll set a fixed rotation of `theta = 0` (this simplifies things since any `theta` will not change the effective bounding box - object is a square).  I need to find valid `x` and `y` coordinates for the object's center.  The object's half-extents are `0.035`, so the valid center coordinates are bounded as `4.235 <= x <= 4.765` and `-0.565 <= y <= -0.035`.  These ranges are about 0.53 units long, making it easy to create a grid of points.
           
           I'll generate an 8x7 grid within this range. The number of steps is such that the area is covered in approximately equal steps.  The `x` step will be  0.53 / 7 and the `y` step will be 0.53 / 6. The x_coordinates are given by `4.235 + i * (0.53 / 7)` for `i` from `0` to `7` inclusive. The y_coordinates are given by `-0.565 + j * (0.53 / 6)` for `j` from `0` to `6` inclusive.  This gives me 56 potential positions; I'll simply take the first 50. I will return a list of tuples `(0, 0, x, y)` as required, setting `theta = 0` for all placements. Since I'm not reusing any previous, known placements, there is no chance that any prior collisions have occured.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Analysis and Placement Strategy for Object 10**
           
           My analysis begins by confirming the successful placements of Object ID 5, validating the established constraints. Now, I need to place Object ID 10, a near-square object with dimensions of roughly 0.0733 x 0.0733, within Surface 0 defined by the points ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  The critical task is ensuring Object 10 does not collide with the previously placed Object 5, as per the problem statement.
           
           The calculations for valid placement ranges are straightforward, considering the object's half-extents (approximately 0.0366) and the surface boundaries. For Object 10, the valid X-range is [4.236663, 4.763337] and the valid Y-range is [-0.563337, -0.036663].  However, these ranges must be adjusted to account for collision avoidance.
           
           Based on the provided placement feedback, I have successfully placed the ID 5 object 50 times. I consider each of these previous locations of object 5, and their AABB's when performing the collision avoidance calculations. The core principle is that the absolute difference in the center coordinates of two non-colliding objects must be greater than the sum of their half-extents in both the X and Y dimensions. In this instance, the total collision threshold for x and y is 0.07166311579110726.
           
           I devised a strategy that simplifies collision detection by choosing Object 10 x locations that will prevent collisions. The x positions of existing objects are `x = 4.235` and `x = 4.310714`. By placing object 10 to the right of the already placed objects will guarantee that it does not collide. If I choose an x coordinate of 4.4, this will prevent all x axis collisions. Then I will select valid y values from a range spanning the object dimensions.
           
           I will iterate across the y values between y_min and y_max with evenly space values to have a robust placement algorithm, where each new value will be y = y_min + i * y_step, with i from 0 to 49.
           
           My final placement strategy will be as follows:
           
           -   surf\_idx = 0
           -   theta = 0.0
           -   x = 4.4
           -   For i from 0 to 49
               -   y = -0.5633368842088926 + i \* 0.010748444253424188
               -   (surf_idx, theta, x, y) is a safe object placement.
