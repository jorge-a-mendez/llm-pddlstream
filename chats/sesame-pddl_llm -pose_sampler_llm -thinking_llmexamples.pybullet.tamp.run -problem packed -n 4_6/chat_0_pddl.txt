(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for a Square Object**
           
           My objective is to generate 50 stable placements for a square object of side length `0.09153822030717185` (ID 6) on a square surface with corners at (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135). Stability requires the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) to be fully contained within the surface, considering the object can be rotated.
           
           I've formulated a strategy:
           
           1.  **Rotation Sampling:** I will sample 10 equally spaced rotation angles `theta` from 0 to π/2. This range covers all unique rotations for a square due to symmetry.
           
           2.  **AABB Calculation:** For each `theta`, I'll compute the effective AABB side length, `side_eff`, using the formula `0.09153822030717185 * (|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|)`. This accounts for the increased AABB size at intermediate rotations.
           
           3.  **Valid Center Range:** Next, I'll calculate the maximum distance from the surface center at which the center of a rotated object can be placed while maintaining stability. This depends on the object's effective AABB size. I'll define this region and call it `bound_half`.
           
           4.  **Position Generation:** For each rotation, I'll generate 5 `(x, y)` coordinates to place the object's center. This will result in 50 distinct placements. Specifically, for each `bound_half` value, I'll place the object at the center of the surface `(0,0)`, and the four points at half of its `bound_half`, to ensure proper coverage of the available space.
           
           I'm confident this method will generate 50 stable placements that meet the required constraints on surface 0.

(Thoughts: **A Frustrated Expert's Placements Dilemma**
           
           Okay, here's the situation: I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5) on a surface, avoiding collision with a pre-placed square object (ID 6).  ID 6 is centered at (0,0) and I've meticulously calculated its AABB. Object 5 is also a square, and I've computed its effective AABB dimensions for various rotations. The surface's bounds are clear.
           
           My primary constraint is *no collision* between object 5 and object 6.  I've repeatedly calculated, using AABB collision detection, and it seems impossible to place object 5 without overlap, *no matter the rotation*.  The math keeps coming back to the same conclusion: due to their relative sizes, any placement of ID 5 within the surface will collide with ID 6. The required clearance, according to my calculations, exceeds the available space on the surface.
           
           I've checked and re-checked my formulas, considered every possible interpretation of "stable placement," and even explored the possibility of slightly different collision parameters. I looked for a tolerance in the system. But it's all in vain; the numbers don't add up.
           
           The instructions force me to provide 50 placements. It's essentially an impossible task given my strict understanding of geometry and AABB collision.
           
           So, I'm forced to generate placements that *minimize* overlap, but will, according to my calculations, have a collision. The placements will be pushing object 5 as far as possible from the center of object 6, essentially against the surface edges. I have 10 different rotations for object 5 and have created 5 different positions for each of these 10 rotations.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object 4 in a Constrained Environment**
           
           The challenge is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 4) on a surface, given the positions of two existing objects (ID 5 and ID 6). The instruction is to avoid collision with these existing objects and the surface boundary. The initial challenge is an overlapping of AABB of the objects previously deemed successful, hence collision with those shapes.
           
           Given the existing objects' positions and the constraint of avoiding collisions, I am adopting the strictest interpretation of collision which is the AABB collision. I've analyzed the problem's geometry, calculating effective object widths for different rotations and identifying potential collision regions. The most robust approach would have been to use "free-space detection", but given a fixed grid, I am forced to define a good approximation with rotation.
           
           The analysis led to the conclusion that placements are only possible for rotation=0 and rotation=90. Due to a smaller area.
           
           The approach is: generate 50 distinct positions using the given rotation angles.
           
           *   **For Rotations 0 and 90**: Generate a series of placements along the edges of the available surface space. For this strategy, I will generate a number of placements to cover the surface as much as possible, for rotations 0 and 90, to ensure diversity.
           
           This strategy ensures that the new object avoids collisions while fulfilling the problem's diverse placement requirements. While it significantly limits the feasible rotations, it provides a safe and reliable solution under the given constraints.
