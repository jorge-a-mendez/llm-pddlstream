User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is enclosed by a large square (obstacles 0-4). There's a vertical wall in the middle (obstacle 5). Many small obstacles are scattered throughout the scene. I need to find positions that are within 2 units of the target point (-0.9702952467000185, -1.0201659972744747) and avoid these obstacles. Given the target is around (-1, -1), I'll focus on the bottom-left quadrant.
           
           Positions:
           (-1.8702952467000185 -1.0201659972744747)
           (-0.9702952467000185 -1.9201659972744747)
           (-0.5702952467000185 -0.5201659972744747)
