(Thoughts: **A Detailed Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of my plan to get `new-axiom@0()` true in the `pr2-tamp` domain. It seems like the goal translates to getting object `v12` *on* `v18`, with `v12` being of a certain type, determined by axiom definitions. I'll need to figure out how to arrange the objects correctly and use the robot's actions accordingly.
           
           First, I looked at the axiom for `new-axiom@0()`, which breaks down into `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. Luckily, the initial state gives me that `v12` is the right `type` (the initial state has `type(v12, v17)`) and that `v12` *could* be on `v18` (due to `stackable(v12, v18)`). Therefore the main focus is on getting `v12` onto `v18`.
           
           Analyzing the `on` axiom, I understand that getting an object `on` another is equivalent to having it be both `supported` and `atpose`. Conveniently, the initial state provides `supported(v12, #p1, v18)`, meaning if `v12` is at pose `#p1`, it will be supported on `v18`. This is good, as it helps connect the initial state facts to goal facts.
           
           So, the plan is to get `v12` to `#p1` – in other words, get `atpose(v12, #p1)` true. Currently, `v12` is at `v13`. I see that I have `pick` and `place` actions available for `v12`. I have to move the base and then execute pick and place actions, and the preconditions, actions, and effects need to be considered.
           
           Here's the planned sequence of actions:
           
           1.  **Move the base to base configuration `q2`:** This base configuration looks suitable for picking and placing, and will be required for the following `pick` action to work, so I start with `move_base v3 #q2 #t5`. The relevant facts and preconditons are met, so this base motion should be valid.
           2.  **Pick up `v12`:** Using the action `pick v4 v12 v13 #g1 #q2 #t4`, I'll use the robot's arm `v4`, pick `v12` from its current pose `v13` with grasp `#g1` using trajectory `#t4` while base configuration is `#q2`. The preconditions are met: `kin` and `atpose` being true, `handempty`, and negative constraints are met.
           3.  **Move the base to base configuration `q3`:** Next, I'll need to move the base again, this time to the base configuration `#q3`, to ensure the `place` action has the right base pose to be valid. The move is `move_base #q2 #q3 #o0`.
           4.  **Place `v12` at pose `#p1`:** Finally, I'll use the `place v4 v12 #p1 #g1 #q3 #t6` action to place `v12` at the desired pose `#p1`. This `place` requires that the arm has a grasp on the object, the bconf is `#q3`, `kin` is satisfied and negative constraints are satisfied.
           
           After executing this sequence, I should have `atpose(v12, #p1)` which along with `supported(v12, #p1, v18)` from the initial state, should result in `on(v12, v18)`. With `type(v12, v17)` also satisfied, my original goal `new-axiom@0()` will be achieved! I just need to verify that all the `canmove()` constraints are also always satisfied.
