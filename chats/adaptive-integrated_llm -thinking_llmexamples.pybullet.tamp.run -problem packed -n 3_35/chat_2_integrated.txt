User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.042, -0.382), (0.056, -0.283)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.282, 0.369), (-0.183, 0.468)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.144, 0.432), (-0.055, 0.522)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.007, -0.332, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.942, 0.336).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.233, 0.419, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.37, 0.929).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.1, 0.477, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.579, 0.815).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **Plan Summary: Achieving a Tri-Object Placement Goal**
           
           Alright, here's the game plan: I need to get three objects, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, all supported by the surface `v16` and in specific poses. Currently, these objects are resting on `v11`. The robot has two arms, but only arm `v4` is controllable, and it's the only one specified for this task.  The robot's base is initially at configuration `v3`.
           
           My primary objective is to make sure these three objects are correctly placed on the target surface (`v16`).  I can achieve this by breaking it down into a sequence of pick-and-place actions. The idea is to move each object individually from `v11` onto `v16`. Since I'm working with the available `pick` and `place` actions that all use base configuration `#o3`,  I must first bring the base configuration from its original `v3` to this designated `#o3` location.
           
           First, I'll execute the move-base to the required base configuration `#o3`, ensuring I'm in a position where the arm can reach. After that, I'll pick `v8` from its current location on `v11`, then place it on `v16` using a specific, calculated pose.  Next, I'll repeat this process for `v12` and finally for `v14`, ensuring to place them in separate, collision-free locations on `v16`.
           
           The crucial thing is to specify unique, collision-free placements on the surface, which is where careful pose selection comes into play. I'll take advantage of the surface's dimensions to define distinct, valid placement coordinates (x, y, z, and theta) for each object. The goal is to set everything up, execute my sequence of moves, and have these items correctly arranged in the target configuration.  In the end, all conditions, goal, and axioms will be satisfied, and the task will be complete.
