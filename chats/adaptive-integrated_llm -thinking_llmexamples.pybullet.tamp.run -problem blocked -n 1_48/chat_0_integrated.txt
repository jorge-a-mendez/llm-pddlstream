User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.548, -0.095, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.13, 0.992).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.591, -0.138), (-4.505, -0.052)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a specific type *on* a particular object. Specifically, I'm looking to have something of type `v17` be *on* `v18`. From the initial state, I know there are two possibilities: `v8` and `v12` could fulfill that `type` requirement.
           
           **Identifying Obstacles and Constraints**
           
           To be *on* something requires two conditions: *supported* and *atpose*.  The initial state gives me that both `v8` and `v12` are supported *on* `v18` via `#o2`, but crucially, they are *atpose* elsewhere: `v8` at `v9` and `v12` at `v13`. The core problem now becomes getting either `v8` or `v12` to `#o2`.
           
           **Examining Action Space and Infeasibility**
           
           The real kicker here is the *extremely* limited action set. The only action instance available is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This move-base action does precisely nothing to change object locations. It only affects the robot's base configuration. The typical *pick* and *place* actions which would be needed to move `v8` or `v12` are *not* provided in the action list, meaning they cannot be used.
           
           **Conclusion: Unattainable Goal**
           
           The conclusion is inescapable:  Given the initial state and the severely limited action set, I cannot move either object to `v18` to satisfy the *on* predicate. The goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently *unachievable*.
