User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object

           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.548, -0.095, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.13, 0.992).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.591, -0.138), (-4.505, -0.052)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, breaking down my reasoning every step of the way.**
           
           My goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a specific type *on* object `v18`. Looking at the initial state, I can see that `v8` is the only object of the correct type (`v17`) that could potentially satisfy this, and importantly, the *supported* predicate is in the initial state with `v8, #o2, and v18`, implying a place on `v18` that works for a stackable green object.
           
           My initial thought is to make `v8` *on* `v18`. Looking at my constraints, the robot's base can't move. So, I need a plan to pick `v8` up and place it on `v18`, ensuring it's in the *supported* relation.
           
           From the initial state, I see that `v8` is currently at `v9`. So, the initial plan is to pick `v8` from `v9` and place it onto `v18`. This requires two actions: `pick` and `place`.
           
           I check my available actions and see `pick` requires `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`, which is the right right arm picking up the correct object at the right grasping point. I know I have to plan for a trajectory for the pick, but this is specified in the kin predicate as #o4. Now, the `kin` predicate is satisfied (v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4), and the other preconditions like `handempty(v4)`, and that the base is already at `v3`, are also true.
           
           I have to make sure I don't violate any constraints on picking. Checking for `unsafeapproach` and `unsafeatraj`, I don't see any.
           Following that, I will need a place action using a similar kinematic constraint. I have `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)` in my available facts. Again, the appropriate predicates are true, so I place `v8` using the same arm with the same trajectory, and the new predicate `atpose(v8, #o2)` and the existing predicate `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` can now be satisfied.
           
           This seems like a solid path! The trick is to ensure the final pose `v8` is in the right place, so the *supported* predicate holds.
           
           The tricky part comes in making sure `v8` lands in the appropriate place on `v18`. I need a continuous pose for `#o2`. Looking at the AABB of `v18`, I decide to place `v8` in the middle and at the same height as the rest of the objects on that tabletop. Since `v18` is described in the initial state as being composed, it is likely a flat surface.
           
           Therefore, for `#o2` I choose `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`.
           
           My plan is now to
           1. Pick `v8` from `v9` using arm `v4`, grasp `#o1`, base config `v3`, and arm trajectory `#o4`.
           2. Place `v8` at pose `#o2` on object `v18` using arm `v4`, grasp `#o1`, base config `v3`, and arm trajectory `#o4`.
           This will make both parts of the goal true.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachability**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a planning problem, and initially, I tried a strategy involving `pick` and `place` actions to satisfy the goal: get the object `?green` (represented by either `v8` or `v12`) onto the surface `v18`. My understanding of the domain suggests that `pick` and `place` are the core actions needed for this. The goal translates to the `on(?green, v18)` predicate, which I know requires moving an object that is supported at some pose to `v18`.
           
           However, the key issue is the constraint on valid action instances. I wasn't allowed to use *any* action except `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action doesn't actually *do* anything that helps achieve my goal. The domain definition may allow for `pick` and `place` actions, but the particular instances of those actions that I need (with the specific objects and continuous parameter values) *aren't* in the allowed list. 
           
           The allowed action, `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, does not modify any critical states for achieving the goal. No predicate values change, no objects change their supported poses. `move_base` is effectively a no-op that sets `canmove()` to true. This action by itself cannot get the object onto the target surface. I can't even get my arm to have it.
           
           Therefore, because I'm constrained to a single action that cannot change the relationships needed to satisfy the goal, I must conclude that the goal is *unachievable* given the current restrictions. Any plan including `pick` and `place` instances would be invalid.
