(Thoughts: **Planning to Stack Objects**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've got this goal: put a bunch of objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) on v18.  They're all initially on v11.  The key is to use the arm, v4.  I need to pick each object from its initial pose (v9, v13, v15, v17, respectively) and place them all onto v18 at pose #o2.
           
           Since I have the appropriate kinematic information (kin facts), that means I know the valid trajectories and grasps for each object. The `pick` and `place` actions will do the heavy lifting here. The `move_base` action doesn't seem necessary since the base configuration (bconf v3) doesn't change, as all actions will use `v3` anyway.
           
           So, the plan is simple:  Pick each object, and then place each object, one at a time. The pick and place actions depend on the `kin` predicates, as well as the `atpose` of the object, `handempty` and `atbconf` predicates. The `place` action depends on the `atgrasp` predicate. Each pick/place will need trajectory parameters, grasp parameters, and the continuous parameters `#o1`, `#o3`, `#o4`.
           
           I'll iterate through the objects. The order doesn't matter, as long as each object's position meets the `on` predicate at the end (`on(v8, v18)`, `on(v12, v18)`, `on(v14, v18)`, `on(v16, v18)`). I'm assuming that the pose `#o2` works for each object and doesn't cause any collisions.  I will take v14, then v16, then v8 and then v12. The `handempty` and `atpose` predicates will change with each step.
           
           *   **Action Sequence for v14**:
               *   **Pick:** `pick(v4, v14, v15, #o1, v3, #o4)`
               *   **Place:** `place(v4, v14, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           *   **Action Sequence for v16**:
               *   **Pick:** `pick(v4, v16, v17, #o1, v3, #o4)`
               *   **Place:** `place(v4, v16, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           *   **Action Sequence for v8**:
               *   **Pick:** `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`
               *   **Place:** `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           *   **Action Sequence for v12**:
               *   **Pick:** `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, v3, #o4)`
               *   **Place:** `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           
           And that should do it! After each `place` action, the goal is achieved! No unsafe conditions are explicitly mentioned, so I will assume that these actions can be performed without any problems.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Unreachable Goal with Restricted Actions**
           
           Okay, so I've been called out for using invalid actions in my previous attempt. The user, an expert like myself, rightly pointed out that I didn't stick to the explicitly allowed action instance: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  Let's re-evaluate this.
           
           The goal is to have all four objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`) "on" `v18`. From the axioms, this means each object needs a supporting pose `?p` on `v18` (`supported(?o, ?p, v18)`) and that pose has to be achieved (`atpose(?o, ?p)`).
           
           Looking at the initial state, I see that the objects are all supported on `v11` at their respective poses (e.g., `v12` is on `v11` at pose `v13`). My task is to move them to be on `v18` instead. That means I need to change these `atpose` facts.
           
           To do this, I would normally use `pick` and `place` actions. However, here's the kicker: the only allowed action instance is that `move_base` thing.  `pick` and `place` aren't even an option. I am, in essence, handcuffed.
           
           The `move_base` action moves the base from `v3` to `v3` via a trajectory.  It starts with the preconditions met, and it ends, effectively, in the same state. No object positions are impacted.  It seems useless for achieving this goal.
           
           Since my goal requires changing the `atpose` facts, and I can only use this specific `move_base` action that does *not* affect object poses, the goal is, unfortunately, unreachable. It's a frustrating situation when the tools available just can't get the job done.
