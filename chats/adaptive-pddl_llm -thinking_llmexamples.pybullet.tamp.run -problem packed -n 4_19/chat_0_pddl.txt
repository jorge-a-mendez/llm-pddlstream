           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning Through Goal Unreachability**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a planning problem. The goal is clear: I need to get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto `v18`. From my knowledge of the problem, I understand that an object is "on" another if it's "supported" in the right "atpose".
           
           First, I examine the initial state.  I confirm my understanding of the "on" condition and verify that none of the target objects are initially on `v18`. They're all on `v11`.
           
           Now, I look at the available actions.  I've got the standard moves: `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`. However, a crucial constraint emerges: the *only* action I'm allowed to use is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`.  This immediately raises a red flag. The move_base action can only change the robot's base configuration. It doesn't directly manipulate objects or their positions with respect to other objects, which is essential to make these changes.
           
           To achieve the desired "on" conditions, I need to manipulate the "atpose" facts. I know from the axioms that to change an "on" condition I must change the "atpose". I recognize this requires the `pick` and `place` actions; those are the actions that alter an object's position.
           
           But here's the problem: I can't use `pick` or `place`!  The action list only allows that specific `move_base` action.
           
           Consequently, I re-analyze the initial state again, and my conclusion solidifies: since the objective requires re-arranging objects, and I'm restricted to a base movement, which doesn't directly affect their "on" conditions, the goal is unreachable.  No valid plan exists given these constraints.
