User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The environment is bounded by a square from -2.5 to 2.5 in both x and y. There's a vertical wall along x=0. There are several smaller rectangular obstacles scattered throughout the environment. Some of them are close to the boundaries, like 7, 8, 9, 10, 19, 20, 21. There are also smaller obstacles in the center. I should prioritize positions that are not close to any of these obstacles.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

There are several smaller rectangular obstacles scattered throughout the environment. Some of them are close to the boundaries, like 7, 8, 9, 10, 19, 20, 21. There are also smaller obstacles in the center. My previous attempts show that the first position collided with the x=0 wall and obstacle 9, the second collided with obstacle 12. The third position was not reachable for the robot base. I will try to find positions on the opposite side of the target point or slightly further away, avoiding the known obstacles and the x=0 axis.
