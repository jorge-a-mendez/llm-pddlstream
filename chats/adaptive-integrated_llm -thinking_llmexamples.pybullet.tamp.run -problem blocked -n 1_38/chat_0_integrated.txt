User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.625, -0.498, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.481, 0.877).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.673, -0.546), (-4.577, -0.45)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom controllable(v4)

           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom type(v12, v17)

           Atom stackable(v12, v18)

           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Unreachable Due to Action Constraints**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of type `v17` located on object `v18`.  From the initial state, the only objects known to be of type `v17` are `v12` and `v8`.
           
           To place an object on `v18`, I need to use the `on(?o, ?r)` predicate which requires both `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`. Looking at the available supporting predicates related to `v18`, I can have either `v8` or `v12` on `v18` at pose `#o2`.  So, I need either `atpose(v8, #o2)` or `atpose(v12, #o2)`.
           
           However, the only available action is `move_base`. This is a clear problem. The `on` predicate strongly implies I will need `pick` and `place` actions to move the objects, and the problem explicitly states that only actions in the provided list are valid.  Since I cannot change the `atpose` of objects, I cannot satisfy the preconditions of `on(?green, v18)`.  
           
           I then verified that, initially, neither `v8` nor `v12` is on `v18`. Since the `move_base` action does not change any object positions or poses, I conclude that I cannot make an object of type `v17` be on `v18`.  The objective is impossible.
