           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements**
           
           Alright, I need to figure out how to place this object, `(size_x, size_y) = (0.09667, 0.09667)`, a total of 50 times on surface `0`, an AABB from `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.  I'm aiming for combinations of  `surf_idx`, `theta`, `x`, and `y`.  The object must stay entirely within the surface, of course.
           
           The object's AABB rotated by `theta` needs to fit within the surface's AABB.  I'm using `w` for size_x, and `h` for size_y, so the new AABB dimensions `W` and `H` after rotation are calculated as: `W = w * abs(cos(theta)) + h * abs(sin(theta))` and `H = w * abs(sin(theta)) + h * abs(cos(theta))`.
           
           For surface 0, the AABB bounds are obvious. To keep the object's center `(x, y)` inside, I know it has to satisfy two inequalities: `surf_min_x + W/2 <= x <= surf_max_x - W/2` and `surf_min_y + H/2 <= y <= surf_max_y - H/2`.
           
           Since the object is almost a square, the math simplifies a bit.  I'll use `s = 0.09667`.
           
           If I keep the rotation at 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees,  `W` and `H` are approximately equal to `s`.  That gives me an `x` range of about `-0.0866` to `0.0866`, and the same for `y`. This is good, I have a decent central region.
           
           At 45 degrees, `W` and `H` become `s * sqrt(2)`, or about 0.1367.  The math still works: it fits.  I see I can place it anywhere on the surface, regardless of the rotation. To keep it simpler, I'll calculate the bounds for theta=0 and pi/4.
           
           To hit 50 placements, I'll generate a grid. The theta values I'll use: `0` and `pi/4`.
           
           So, for `theta = 0`, I'll place the object at 5 different `x` coordinates and 5 different `y` coordinates to get 25 placements.
           
           For `theta = pi/4` I'll use 5 coordinates for `x` and 5 coordinates for `y` in a grid as well, giving me a total of 50.
           
           I think this will cover my needs.
           
           Let's write down the steps:
           
           1.  Calculate object's bounding box `W` and `H` at `theta=0`.
           2.  Calculate the coordinates `x` and `y` within the range using 5 coordinates in a grid.
           3.  Calculate object's bounding box `W` and `H` at `theta=pi/4`.
           4.  Calculate the coordinates `x` and `y` within the range using 5 coordinates in a grid.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Planning: Avoiding Collision**
           
           Okay, so I've got a successful placement for Object 5, ID: 5, at `(surf_idx=0, theta=0.0, x=-0.0866626891305958, y=-0.08666268913059579)`.  This means it didn't hit anything *fixed*. I need to account for this. Now, I have to place Object 4, ID: 4, which is *almost* square, on the same surface (Surface 0, `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`).  Object 4 has extents of `(0.07670439002180818, 0.07670439002180818)`.
           
           My goal is to generate 50 stable placements for Object 4, while guaranteeing no collision with Object 5.  First, I've defined the AABB of Object 5, which is centered at `(-0.0866626891305958, -0.08666268913059579)` and has dimensions `(0.09667462173880839, 0.09667462173880842)`.  It's effectively a square box that occupies the region `[-0.135, -0.0383253782611916] x [-0.135, -0.03832537826119158]`.
           
           I've decided to consider Object 4's rotations to be `0` and `pi/4`. For `theta=0`, the AABB for object 4 is centered at `(x_4, y_4)` with dimensions `W_4 = H_4 = 0.07670439002180818`.  Without considering Object 5, valid positions for object 4 are within `[-0.09664780498909591, 0.09664780498909591] x [-0.09664780498909591, 0.09664780498909591]`. Then, to avoid the Object 5's AABB, the center of Object 4, `(x_4, y_4)` *cannot* be in the collision area. The no-go zone is an expanded region of Object 5.
           
           For `theta=0`, to avoid Object 5, the center of Object 4 cannot be within  `[-0.09664780498909591, 0.00002681674971249999] x [-0.09664780498909591, 0.00002681674971251]`.
           
           So, for `theta=0`, the center's location can be  anywhere within the valid region:   `x` in `[x_min_valid, x_max_valid]` and `y` in `[y_min_valid, y_max_valid]`. I will divide the `X x Y` area into four quadrants based on `collision_x_max = 0.00002681674971249999` and `collision_y_max = 0.00002681674971251`.
           
           I must filter out the points where either  `x <= collision_x_max` AND `y <= collision_y_max`.
           This gives three free regions:
           
           Region 1: `x > collision_x_max` and `y > collision_y_min`
           Region 2: `x > collision_x_min` and `y > collision_y_max`
           Region 3: `x > collision_x_max` and `y > collision_y_min`
           
           So, I define

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object ID 6**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new task: place object ID 6 on surface 0 without it colliding with objects ID 5 and ID 4, and I need to find 50 stable placements. I can see the surface dimensions and the bounding boxes (AABBs) for the two obstacles already in place. It's a bit of a spatial reasoning problem, but I can handle it.
           
           First, I'll calculate the available space on surface 0, taking into account the current obstacles. Then I will generate a set of candidate placements by rotating object 6 by different angles (theta). I'll need to calculate the AABB for object 6 for all the rotations (0 and pi/4 radians) and then check whether the AABB falls within surface 0 or collides with objects ID 5 or ID 4. If all the checks are positive, the placement is valid.
           
           I've got the surface bounds (-0.135 to 0.135 on both x and y) and the extents of the object. Object ID 6 is nearly square (0.0964 x 0.0964). With a rotation of 0, the AABB is also square. With a rotation of pi/4, the rotated AABB is elongated (0.136 x 0.136).
           
           I will systematically find a series of good placements. I'll need to make sure the object's boundaries don't overlap with any existing boundaries. I'll need to generate a set of test points, rotate object 6, then test if the location is good.
           
           I'm ready to calculate a bunch of locations, rotating a box in a confined area and checking if it runs into something!
           
           After some calculations, I came up with 50 valid placements.
