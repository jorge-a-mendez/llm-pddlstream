(Thoughts: **Strategic Plan for Object Manipulation**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is crystal clear: to achieve `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  Currently, those objects are supported by `v11` at their respective initial poses. I see that `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are all graspable and stackable on `v16`. Given the current configuration, and assuming the negative preconditions hold - which means the base is static and the moves are collision free, a sequential approach is the most efficient.
           
           Here's my plan of attack:
           
           1.  **Grasp and Lift:** I'll begin by picking up `v12` from `v11`.  The key here is utilizing the `kin` predicates to ensure I have the appropriate kinematics for the grasp and lift.
           2.  **Reposition:**  Next, I'll place `v12` onto `v16` using the corresponding `kin` for the place action, ensuring the pose aligns correctly. This will achieve `on(v12, v16)`.
           3.  **Repeat:**  I will then repeat the pick-and-place process for `v8` and `v14`, stacking them sequentially on `v16`. The order is irrelevant.
           
           The available `move_base` action suggests a fixed base configuration, which simplifies the planning as it can be ignored. I will double check the effects of each action to ensure the pre-conditions for subsequent actions are met, and that the negation preconditions are met as well.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, so the user's feedback indicates the previous plan was flawed due to invalid actions. Now I'm tasked with re-evaluating the strategy with severely limited options.  I see that the only valid action instance is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  Essentially, the robot can only move *itself* to the same location, which is useless here.
           
           My goal is to achieve `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  To do this, I need `pick` and `place` actions, which are absent from the list of valid actions. This immediately presents a problem. Without the ability to manipulate objects, moving them to the target location, *v16*, is impossible.
           
           Examining the initial state, I note that `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are currently supported by `v11`. Specifically, `v12` is at `v13`, `v8` is at `v9`, and `v14` is at `v15`.  Given the axioms and their locations, each object is currently `on(v11)`.
           
           Since the permitted action only moves the base and does not enable any object manipulation, and I *require* `pick` and `place` actions to satisfy the goal by getting the objects *on(v16)*, I conclude that the goal is currently unachievable given the restriction to the single available action. I must inform the user of this limitation.
