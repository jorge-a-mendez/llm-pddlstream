           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 10 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I need to generate 50 stable placements for object ID 10 on surface 0, which is defined by the coordinates (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0), effectively a 0.6x0.6 square. The object itself is nearly square with dimensions approximately 0.096x0.096.  A placement is a tuple (surf_idx, theta, x, y), where surf_idx is always 0 in this case, theta is the rotation, and (x, y) is the center of the object's AABB.
           
           Since the object is small relative to the surface and very close to square, the critical factor is ensuring it's *fully contained* within the surface bounds regardless of its rotation. I need to take into account the varying effective width and height caused by rotation. Using trigonometric functions to determine the width and height as theta rotates, I can define the effective width and effective height as a function of the cos() and sin() of theta. The effective bounds are widest at the 45-degree angle.
           
           To ensure the placement stays within the bounds of the 0.6x0.6 surface, I've calculated the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates where the center of the object can be placed while allowing for rotation. Specifically, I'll calculate the widest dimension and use that half dimension to adjust the valid x and y range from the 4.2x-0.6 to 4.8x0.0 for the position of the center of the object, effectively making the bounding area slightly smaller, this ensures that the object is always contained in the surface even when rotated.
           
           I'll generate a grid of x and y coordinates within the safe range using 5 steps for x and 10 for y for a total of 50 combinations. To ensure further diversity, I'll systematically vary the rotation, theta. It is most efficient to make theta a single increment over a period of time to create a uniform coverage of angles. Specifically, I'll be creating 50 evenly-spaced angles from 0 to just shy of 2*pi. I will apply these `50` angles from 0 to `2*pi` to each set of `x` and `y` coordinates.
           
           This approach gives me 50 placements with diverse positions and orientations, ensuring that object 10 is stably placed on surface 0 for any rotation. I am ready to calculate and output these placements.
