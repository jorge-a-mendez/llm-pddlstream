           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.
           
           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q78', '#t236'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g28', '#q78', '#t234'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q78', '#q82', '#t243'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', 'p3', '#g28', '#q82', '#t240'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q82', '#q79', '#t244'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v12', 'v13', '#g29', '#q79', '#t237'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q79', '#q81', '#t245'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v12', 'p4', '#g29', '#q81', '#t239'))

           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q77', '#q80', '#t242'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v14', 'p5', '#g27', '#q80', '#t238'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-pose-pose:('v14', 'p5', 'v8', 'p3')->()`
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions. If the failure occurs after placing on any pose that does not start with '#', it may be due to using a combination of invalid poses.As the expert, you may decide to choose additional poses, providing their continuous values using any free pose starting with '#'. 

Model:     The goal is to place all three objects (v8, v12, v14) on the surface v16. Currently, v8 is at v9 (supported by v11), v12 is at v13 (supported by v11), and v14 is at v15 (supported by v11). All objects are currently on v11 which is a large surface. The target surface v16 is smaller. The problem statement provides predefined poses p3, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8, p9, p10, p11, p15, p16, p17 that are supported by v16. I should choose these poses to place the objects to achieve the goal while avoiding collisions between the objects.
           
           The previous plan failed because placing v14 at p5 resulted in a collision with v8 at p3. This means that p3 and p5 are too close to each other for v8 and v14. I need to select a different set of poses or use the available continuous pose #o2 to ensure that the objects do not collide when placed on v16. I also have to consider that all objects are of `stackable` type and can be placed on `v16`.
           
           Given that `v8` (AABB: ((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035))), `v12` (AABB: ((0.032, -0.034), (0.102, 0.036))), and `v14` (AABB: ((-0.085, -0.035), (-0.015, 0.035))) are the objects to be placed on `v16` (AABB: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))), I need to ensure that the chosen poses for these objects allow them to be placed on `v16` without colliding with each other.
           
           The poses p3, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8, p9, p10, p11, p15, p16, p17 are given relative to the center of the `v16` surface. Their absolute positions are:
           p3: (0.0, 0.0, 0.782)
           p4: (0.05, 0.0, 0.782)
           p5: (-0.05, 0.0, 0.782)
           p6: (0.0, 0.0, 0.782) - same as p3
           p7: (0.05, 0.0, 0.782) - same as p4
           p8: (-0.05, 0.0, 0.782) - same as p5
           p9: (0.0, 0.0, 0.782) - same as p3
           p10: (0.05, 0.0, 0.782) - same as p4
           p11: (-0.05, 0.0, 0.782) - same as p5
           p15: (0.0, 0.0, 0.782) - same as p3
           p16: (0.07, 0.0, 0.782)
           p17: (-0.07, 0.0, 0.782)
           
           The issue with the previous plan was placing v14 at p5 and v8 at p3. Both p3 and p5 are too close for these two objects given their bounding boxes. Since p3, p6, p9, p15 are all at (0,0,0.782), and p4, p7, p10 are all at (0.05,0,0.782) and p5, p8, p11 are all at (-0.05,0,0.782), I only have a few distinct absolute locations available without using #o2. The only unique poses are p3 (0,0,0.782), p4 (0.05,0,0.782), p5 (-0.05,0,0.782), p16 (0.07,0,0.782), p17 (-0.07,0,0.782).
           
           I need to place three objects (v8, v12, v14) on v16. Let's reconsider the placement.
           v8 (small square): AABB = ((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035))
           v12 (rectangle): AABB = ((0.032, -0.034), (0.102, 0.036))
           v14 (rectangle): AABB = ((-0.085, -0.035), (-0.015, 0.035))
           v16 (surface): AABB = ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))
           
           Let's try to place them further apart using the available poses.
           Place v8 at p3 (0, 0, 0.782)
           Place v12 at p16 (0.07, 0, 0.782)
           Place v14 at p17 (-0.07, 0, 0.782)
           
           Let's check for collision:
           - v8 at p3: minx = -0.035, maxx = 0.035
           - v12 at p16: minx = 0.07 + 0.032 = 0.102, maxx = 0.07 + 0.102 = 0.172 (This object goes outside v16 which has maxx=0.135, this is not a stable placement).
           
           The given poses p3, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8, p9, p10, p11, p15, p16, p17 are absolute poses. I need to be careful with the bounding boxes. The bounding box values are relative to the object's origin.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the poses with respect to the `v16` AABB: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           The poses are given as the center of the object. So for `v8` at `p3(0,0,0.782)`, the object occupies `(-0.035, -0.035)` to `(0.035, 0.035)`. This is well within `v16`.
           For `v12` at `p16(0.07,0,0.782)`, the object occupies `(0.07+0.032, 0-0.034)` to `(0.07+0.102, 0+0.036)`, which is `(0.102, -0.034)` to `(0.172, 0.036)`. The `maxx` (0.172) is greater than `v16`'s `maxx` (0.135), so `v12` at `p16` is not stable.
           
           Let's look at `v14` at `p17(-0.07,0,0.782)`. The object occupies `(-0.07-0.085, 0-0.035)` to `(-0.07-0.015, 0+0.035)`, which is `(-0.155, -0.035)` to `(-0.085, 0.035)`. The `minx` (-0.155) is less than `v16`'s `minx` (-0.135), so `v14` at `p17` is not stable.
           
           This means that `p16` and `p17` are not suitable for `v12` and `v14` respectively. I will need to use `#o2` for at least one of these objects.
           
           Let's retry with the other poses:
           p3: (0.0, 0.0, 0.782)
           p4: (0.05, 0.0, 0.782)
           p5: (-0.05, 0.0, 0.782)
           
           Place v8 at p3: (center: 0,0) - (minx -0.035, maxx 0.035) within v16 (minx -0.135, maxx 0.135). Stable.
           Place v12 at p4: (center: 0.05,0) - (minx 0.05+0.032=0.082, maxx 0.05+0.102=0.152). Maxx (0.152) is outside v16. Not stable.
           Place v14 at p5: (center: -0.05,0) - (minx -0.05-0.085=-0.135, maxx -0.05-0.015=-0.065). Minx (-0.135) is exactly on the boundary, which should be fine. Maxx (-0.065) is inside. Stable.
           
           So, p4 is problematic for v12.
           What if I use #o2 for v12?
           
           Let's try to place them like this:
           1. Pick v8 from v9 and place it on p3 (which is on v16).
           2. Pick v14 from v15 and place it on p5 (which is on v16). (Previous failure was v14 at p5 collided with v8 at p3. This means that p3 and p5 are too close. The objects were v14 and v8. Let's analyze this again carefully.)
               v8 at p3: x range [-0.035, 0.035]
               v14 at p5: x range [-0.135, -0.065]
               These two ranges do not overlap, so they should not collide. The previous error message was: `test-cfree-pose-pose:('v14', 'p5', 'v8', 'p3')->()` failed. This might imply that the `test-cfree-pose-pose` is considering some larger bounding box or a different origin. However, given the defined AABBs and poses, they should be fine. It is possible the previous plan used different continuous values for the arm movement and base movement parameters.
           
           Given the existing predefined poses, and the bounding boxes, the poses p3, p5 seem to be valid for v8 and v14 on v16 without overlapping their x-ranges.
           Let's choose:
           v8 at p3 (center 0,0) -> [-0.035, 0.035]
           v14 at p5 (center -0.05,0) -> [-0.135, -0.065]
           v12 at a new pose #o2 (center 0.05,0) -> [0.05+0.032, 0.05+0.102] = [0.082, 0.152] - this is still too far to the right.
           
           Let's calculate the available space on `v16`. `v16` is `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           v8: width 0.07, height 0.07
           v12: width 0.07, height 0.07 (0.102-0.032)
           v14: width 0.07, height 0.07 (0.085-0.015)
           
           It seems `v12` has a slightly wider x dimension (0.102-0.032=0.07) but its internal offset is what makes it tricky. If `v12` is at position (px, py), its actual x range is `[px + 0.032, px + 0.102]`.
           Similarly for `v14` at (px, py), its actual x range is `[px - 0.085, px - 0.015]`.
           For `v8` at (px, py), its actual x range is `[px - 0.035, px + 0.035]`.
           
           Let's try to place them in a sequence that works for `v16`.
           The surface `v16` has `x_min = -0.135` and `x_max = 0.135`.
           1. Place `v14` on `v16` at a suitable `x` position. If `v14` is centered at `x`, its footprint is `[x - 0.085, x - 0.015]`. To fit in `v16`, we need `x - 0.085 >= -0.135` and `x - 0.015 <= 0.135`. This means `x >= -0.05` and `x <= 0.15`. Let's use `p5` which is at `(-0.05, 0, 0.782)`. Then `v14` occupies `[-0.135, -0.065]`. This is valid.
           2. Place `v8` on `v16`. Its footprint is `[x - 0.035, x + 0.035]`. We want it to be distinct from `v14`. Let's try `p3` which is at `(0, 0, 0.782)`. Then `v8` occupies `[-0.035, 0.035]`. This is valid and does not overlap with `v14`.
           3. Place `v12` on `v16`. Its footprint is `[x + 0.032, x + 0.102]`. We need `x + 0.032 >= -0.135` and `x + 0.102 <= 0.135`. This means `x >= -0.167` and `x <= 0.033`.
              `p4` is at `(0.05, 0, 0.782)`. Its `x` is `0.05`, which is greater than `0.033`. So `p4` is not stable for `v12`.
              The only other available concrete pose with x within `[-0.167, 0.033]` is `p3` (center 0,0). But `p3` is used by `v8`.
              I need to use `#o2` for `v12`. Let's choose `x = -0.08` for `#o2` for `v12`.
              Then `v12` occupies `[-0.08 + 0.032, -0.08 + 0.102] = [-0.048, 0.022]`.
              
              Checking for collision with `v8` at `p3` (center 0,0): `[-0.035, 0.035]`.
              Checking for collision with `v14` at `p5` (center -0.05,0): `[-0.135, -0.065]`.
           
              `v12` at `#o2` (center -0.08,0): `[-0.048, 0.022]`
              `v8` at `p3` (center 0,0): `[-0.035, 0.035]`
              These overlap! The `x` range of `v12` `[-0.048, 0.022]` is largely contained within `v8`'s `[-0.035, 0.035]`. This will cause a collision.
           
           I need to place the objects such that their x-intervals are disjoint or at least the `test-cfree-pose-pose` function passes.
           Let's try to place them side by side on the y-axis, if possible, given that the poses are defined at y=0.
           The poses provided are all at y=0. That's likely an issue if the objects have significant y dimensions.
           All objects v8, v12, v14 have y dimensions: v8 ((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035)), v12 ((0.032, -0.034), (0.102, 0.036)), v14 ((-0.085, -0.035), (-0.015, 0.035)).
           These are small y dimensions.
           
           Let's rethink the placement entirely using #o2 for all placements on v16, which gives me more flexibility.
           v16: AABB = ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           Let's try to arrange them to avoid collision and keep them on `v16`.
           Place `v14` ([-0.085, -0.015])
           Place `v8` ([-0.035, 0.035])
           Place `v12` ([0.032, 0.102])
           
           This is relative to the center of the object.
           Let's try to place them at `y=0` on `v16`.
           v14 at #o2_v14, x=-0.08 (e.g. at x=-0.08). Range: [-0.08-0.085, -0.08-0.015] = [-0.165, -0.095].
           This is too far left. `x_min > -0.135`. So `x-0.085 >= -0.135` -> `x >= -0.05`.
           Let's try to place v14 centered at x = -0.05. Then `v14` range `[-0.135, -0.065]`. This is at the edge.
           Let's choose `x = -0.04` for `v14`. Then range `[-0.125, -0.055]`. (Pose #o2_v14 for v14).
           
           Place `v8`. Its range is `[x - 0.035, x + 0.035]`.
           We need to pick an `x` that is not overlapping with `[-0.125, -0.055]`.
           Let's choose `x=0` for `v8`. Then range `[-0.035, 0.035]`. (Pose #o2_v8 for v8).
           This does not overlap with `v14`.
           
           Place `v12`. Its range is `[x + 0.032, x + 0.102]`.
           We need to pick an `x` that is not overlapping with `[-0.125, -0.055]` or `[-0.035, 0.035]`.
           Try `x=0.03`. Range: `[0.03+0.032, 0.03+0.102] = [0.062, 0.132]`. (Pose #o2_v12 for v12).
           This fits in `v16` (`[-0.135, 0.135]`) and does not overlap with `v14` or `v8`.
           
           So, the new poses will be:
           v14 at #o2 (x=-0.04, y=0, z=0.782, theta=0) supported by v16.
           v8 at #o2_second_pose (x=0, y=0, z=0.782, theta=0) supported by v16.
           v12 at #o2_third_pose (x=0.03, y=0, z=0.782, theta=0) supported by v16.
           
           This would require three different #o2 poses. However, the problem statement says "if the plan requires multiple different objects to be placed simultaneously at the same pose starting with '#', then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* object at that pose (not one that works for all), specifying the pose name, object name, and surface name."
           This phrasing implies that I must use the *same* name for the continuous pose (`#o2`) but specify different values for it depending on which object it applies to.
           
           So, I'll use `#o2` for each placement, giving it a unique value for each object.
           
           Plan:
           1. Pick `v8` from `v9`.
           2. Place `v8` on `v16` at `#o2`. (center 0,0,0.782)
           3. Pick `v14` from `v15`.
           4. Place `v14` on `v16` at `#o2`. (center -0.04,0,0.782)
           5. Pick `v12` from `v13`.
           6. Place `v12` on `v16` at `#o2`. (center 0.03,0,0.782)
           
           I will use the `move_base v3 v3 #o0` to represent staying at the current base configuration. The continuous parameters #o0, #o1, #o3, #o4 are defined in the initial state and are related to movements. #o0 for basemotion. #o1 for grasp. #o3 for bconf. #o4 for atraj. These are not poses to be defined.
           
           The base is at v3. The arm v4 is at v5.
           All pick and place actions use the arm v4.
           The kin parameters are (arm, object, pose, grasp, bconf, atraj).
           The plan should be as follows:
           
           Initial:
           v8 at v9 (supported by v11)
           v12 at v13 (supported by v11)
           v14 at v15 (supported by v11)
           Goal:
           v8 on v16
           v12 on v16
           v14 on v16
           
           Let's assume the base is already at a good position (v3).
           
           --Plan--:
           (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           
           --Poses--:
           (#o2 v8 v16): (0.0 0.0 0.782 0.0)
           (#o2 v14 v16): (-0.04 0.0 0.782 0.0)
           (#o2 v12 v16): (0.03 0.0 0.782 0.0)

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', v35) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The previous plan failed because `atbconf(v35)` was not satisfied. Looking at the `kin` predicates, `v35` is consistently used as the base configuration for arm `v32`. However, the current robot arm is `v4` and the current base configuration is `v3`. The `kin` predicates for `v4` (the arm being used) use `#o3` for the base configuration. Therefore, any `pick` or `place` action using arm `v4` must have `atbconf(#o3)` satisfied.
           
           Currently, `atbconf(v3)` is true. I need to make sure `atbconf(#o3)` is true before any `pick` or `place` action for arm `v4`.
           This requires a `move_base` action. There are `move_base` actions available:
           `((move_base #o3 #o3 #o0))`
           `((move_base #o3 v3 #o0))`
           `((move_base v3 #o3 #o0))`
           `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`
           
           Since `atbconf(v3)` is true initially, I need to execute `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)` to set `atbconf(#o3)` to true. I also need to ensure that the `canmove()` predicate is true for the `move_base` action, which it is initially. After a `move_base` action, `canmove()` becomes false, but `pick` and `place` actions set it back to true. So, a `move_base` action should be performed before the first `pick` action.
           
           The updated plan should be:
           1. Move base from `v3` to `#o3`.
           2. Pick `v8` from `v9`.
           3. Place `v8` on `v16` at `#o2` (with specific coordinates for `v8`).
           4. Pick `v14` from `v15`.
           5. Place `v14` on `v16` at `#o2` (with specific coordinates for `v14`).
           6. Pick `v12` from `v13`.
           7. Place `v12` on `v16` at `#o2` (with specific coordinates for `v12`).
           
           The poses defined in the previous response avoid collisions for the objects on `v16` based on their AABBs and the `v16` AABB.
