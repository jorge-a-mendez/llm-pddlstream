(Thoughts: **Stable Object Placements on a Surface**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable positions for a specific object (ID 5, dimensions ~0.0875 x 0.0875) on a given surface (Surface 0, an AABB: (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135)). A placement is stable if the object's AABB is completely within the surface's AABB.  The object can be rotated, changing its effective bounding box dimensions.
           
           The key is that the object is almost a square.  This means its bounding box's *effective* dimensions, after rotation, will change, but not drastically.  I've calculated that the largest bounding box diagonal is approximately 0.1238, meaning for a large range of rotations, the bounds won't change as much.
           
           Given the surface's dimensions, I know that for an object *without* rotation, its center can range from approximately -0.091 to 0.091 in both x and y. If I rotate the object, that range shrinks. To determine the valid range, I need to know the effective bounding box width (after rotation). I need to determine these effective bounds for each specific angle.
           
           To ensure diversity in my placements, I'll strategically vary the rotation angle (`theta`) and the (x, y) coordinates of the object's center. I'll generate a grid of positions for each angle, and then add individual placements with different angles at the center point (0,0).  I've chosen specific angles (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2, and some central ones.) based on knowing that changes will be consistent over the angles.

(Thoughts: **My Planning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's my plan for placing Object 4, building upon the successful placement of Object 5 (ID: 5) that I've just analyzed. My primary goal is to avoid any collision with Object 5 while adhering to the surface bounds of Surface 0.
           
           **Understanding the Constraints:**
           
           I've learned that Object 5 is positioned in the bottom-left corner of the surface. Its dimensions and precise location are:
           
           *   **Object 5:** Approximately a 0.0875 square, placed at (-0.091, -0.091) which AABB of object 5 is approximately `[(-0.135, -0.135), (-0.0475, -0.0475)]`.
           
           Object 4 is a smaller square (0.073 side length).
           
           **Placement Strategy:**
           
           1.  **Surface Adherence:** I need to ensure Object 4 always fits within Surface 0. Surface 0's bounds are `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I will calculate the maximum extents of the object's rotated AABB to ensure it fits within the given bounds.
           
           2.  **Collision Avoidance with Object 5:** Object 5's AABB is a critical area to avoid. My strategy will be to place Object 4 in a position that won't overlap its AABB (`[(-0.135, -0.135), (-0.0475, -0.0475)]`). I'll need to guarantee that Object 4's AABB's x and y coordinates are larger than the upper bounds of the forbidden area OR are smaller than the lower bounds.
           
           **Detailed Calculations:**
           
           I'll iterate through five different rotations (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2).
           
           For each orientation, here's how I will proceed:
           
           *   I'll calculate the *effective* minimum and maximum x and y bounds for Object 4's center. This means I'll use the collision avoidance logic to define the valid placement area for each rotation (a smaller rectangle inside Surface 0).
           
           *   I'll then derive *3 x 3 grid* of placement positions within the valid placement region. These will be 9 positions per orientation.
           
           *   Finally, I'll generate five additional placement positions. For each such position I'll do so by using angles of `pi/10, pi/5, 3*pi/10, 2*pi/5, 9*pi/20`. Each angle will have the placement position as the center of the available space.
           
           I will iterate the calculations for all of these possibilities and verify they do not collide with Object 5.
           
           This is a robust plan that I can easily apply to other scenarios!

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Finding 50 Stable Positions**
           
           I've been tasked with finding 50 stable placements for object ID 6 on surface 0, avoiding collisions with previously placed objects (IDs 5 and 4). This is a spatial reasoning problem, and I've broken it down into a systematic process.
           
           First, I define the playing field: a rectangular surface with known dimensions. I also know the positions and sizes of the existing obstacles (objects 5 and 4) which I've calculated the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for. This will be critical for avoiding collisions. 
           
           The strategy hinges on generating candidate positions (x, y coordinates) and orientations (theta) and then filtering those that overlap the obstacles. Here's the core process:
           1. **Angle Consideration:** I'll begin by evaluating 5 key angles - 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, and pi/2. I'll test each of these with a 10 x 10 grid for each of theta = 0, and pi/2
           2. **Determine Valid Area:** Given the size of Object 6 and rotation, I'll calculate the available "safe" area on the surface.
           3. **Collision Checks**: I'll iterate through the generated candidate x,y positions for each angle, and check those coordinates for collision with any obstacle using the AABBs.
           4. **Placement Acceptance**: When a placement passes all checks (surface containment and no collisions with obstacles), it's recorded as a valid placement.
           5. **Iteration & Adjustment:** I will generate a comprehensive 10x10 grid of points for each angle, and filter the ones that meet the constraints. I will also generate a finer resolution to ensure that the 50 solutions will be found.
           
           I expect that angles other than 0 and pi/2 will yield very few successful placements. By systematically checking the region for collisions using a grid approach, I will try to find enough valid combinations of x, y, and theta to find 50 stable placements.
