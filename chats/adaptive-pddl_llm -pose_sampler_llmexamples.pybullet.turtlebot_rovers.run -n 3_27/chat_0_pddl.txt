User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with dimensions approximately 5x5, centered at the origin, with walls at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5. There's a vertical wall at x=0 that spans the entire room. There are also several smaller rectangular obstacles scattered throughout the room.
           
           My strategy is to try to find positions around the target point that are within the allowed range and avoid known obstacles. I'll prioritize positions that are likely to have a clear line of sight to the target. I will try to sample points on a circle of radius 1 around the target point and adjust if needed, or closer to the target if a wider range seems problematic.
           
           Target point: (-1.65, 0.4)
           Positions:
           (-0.7291 0.1656)
           (-1.3854 -0.4709)
           (-0.4777 0.9926)
