(Thoughts: **My Proposed Solution for `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Alright, after carefully analyzing the provided axioms, initial state, and potential actions, I've devised a comprehensive plan to achieve the `new-axiom@0()` goal. The core idea is to leverage rover `v12` to handle all the necessary image acquisition, analysis, and transmission tasks. `v14` will stay put, as it is unnecessary with how the problem is structured.
           
           Here's my thought process, step-by-step:
           
           1.  **Image Acquisition:** I'll have `v12` utilize its onboard camera `v10` to capture images of `v18`, `v17`, and `v19`. This involves calibrating the camera, taking the images, and then recalibrating for each subsequent image to ensure clear pictures. This is a linear process: calibrate, take, calibrate, take, calibrate, take.
           
           2.  **Image Transmission:** Once the images are captured, I'll direct `v12` to send them to the lander `v9`. This transmission process needs clear line of sight, which is fortunately already assumed.
           
           3.  **Rock Analysis:** Next, I'll have `v12` sample rock `v1` and rock `v7` with its store `v16`, which will be a central step to `receivedanalysis` goals. Each sample requires the rover to be `above` the respective rock, so I can ensure this using facts I found initially. After each sample, I will transmit the analysis back to the lander.
           
           4.  **Store Management:** To ensure that store `v16` is `free` for all states, I will have `v12` `drop_rock(v16)` after *each* sample, which will maintain the `free` goal. This is critical for the plan's validity.
           
           The specific plan will have the sequence of commands in the problem solver.
           
           To execute this, I'll need to make sure the assumptions are well-founded: no blocking elements and the fact parameters are correct. So, let me know when it's time to execute.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10), (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11), (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10), (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11), (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v19 v10), (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v19 v10 v11), (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11), (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11), (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v19 v11), (sample_rock v12 #o5 v1 v16), (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v1), (sample_rock v12 #o5 v7 v16), (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v7)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Action Possibilities and Goal Unreachability**
           
           Okay, I've got the updated instructions and I see that the user rightfully pointed out issues in the previous attempt. I'm focusing solely on the valid action instances now. Let's break this down.
           
           My task is to achieve the `new-axiom@0()` goal, and here are the sub-goals: `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)`, and several `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` conditions.
           
           Looking at the valid actions, I've got two `move` actions which are completely useless as they basically do nothing, and two `drop_rock` actions that are blocked by their preconditions being unmet.
           
           The core problem is immediately obvious: *none* of these actions even touch the core of the unmet goals: achieving `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`. Those need image processing and analysis, which I know requires actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. But these actions were specifically flagged as invalid.
           
           Since the goal relies on actions that are explicitly forbidden, there's no possible way to achieve it given the allowed actions. The goal is unreachable.
