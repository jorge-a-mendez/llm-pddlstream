(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 5**
           
           Alright, my focus here is to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, dimensions roughly 0.094 x 0.094) on a square surface (`surf_0` with side 0.27, centered at (0,0)). A stable placement means the object is *fully contained* within the surface, meaning I need to take the object's rotation into account.
           
           Since the object is nearly square, I'm going to leverage two primary orientations: `0` radians and `pi/4` radians (45 degrees). The main constraints are:
           1.  **Surface Bounds:** The surface's geometry dictates the placement limits.
           2.  **Rotation & AABB:** The object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) changes with rotation, so the effective dimensions, (`rotated_w`, `rotated_h`) must be within the surface constraints. I'm using the formulas  `rotated_w = obj_w * abs(cos(theta)) + obj_h * abs(sin(theta))` and `rotated_h = obj_w * abs(sin(theta)) + obj_h * abs(cos(theta))` to calculate this.
           
           *   **For Theta = 0:**  I calculated that I need to bound x and y in the range `[-0.088, 0.088]`. I'll generate a 5x5 grid of `(x, y)` placements using coordinates `[-0.08, -0.04, 0.0, 0.04, 0.08]`.
           *   **For Theta = pi/4:** I calculated I need to bound x and y in the range `[-0.068, 0.068]`. I'll also generate a 5x5 grid of (x, y) placements using coordinates `[-0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06]`.
           
           This gives me the required 50 placements. I can now efficiently generate these and be confident they are stable based on the AABB bounds.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've got a new object, ID 4, that needs a stable placement on surface 0. The key is avoiding a collision with the previous object, ID 5, which is already there. Object 5 is centered at about (-0.08, -0.08) on the surface.
           
           First, I need to figure out what regions of the surface are *safe* for placing object 4. I'll need to consider how object 4's dimensions (about 0.096 units on each side) interact with object 5's dimensions and placement. Because object 4 is square, I can calculate these regions for a few key rotations.
           
           I'll start by calculating the valid placement region, ignoring collisions for now, based on surface bounds. Then, I'll calculate the *non-collision region* of the surface to avoid any overlap between object 4 and object 5.
           
           I'll focus on two main rotations: 0 radians (no rotation) and pi/4 radians (45 degrees). Since object 4 is square, other rotations won't give me any essentially new information.
           
           For each rotation, I'll calculate the collision-free regions (x, y) where object 4's AABB doesn't collide with object 5's AABB.
           
           **Specific Steps**
           
           1.  **Rotation = 0 radians:**
               *   Calculate the valid x and y range by taking the surface's dimensions and subtracting object 4's half-width.
               *   I'll need to figure out the areas where there won't be a collision with the existing object.
               *   Since object 5 is near the bottom-left of the surface, I'll prioritize trying to place the new object in other quadrants, or just far away from the occupied zone.
           
               *I have x_values, y_values - these are the values for the placement to be at 0 radians - x and y should be >= or be <= some threshold.*
           
               *   For the x-coordinate of object 4 to not collide: `x + obj_4_width/2 <= obj5_x_min` OR `x - obj_4_width/2 >= obj5_x_max`
               *   And the y-coordinate: `y + obj_4_height/2 <= obj5_y_min` OR `y - obj_4_height/2 >= obj5_y_max`
               *   I did the calculation, the result is the thresholds for x-coordinate and y-coordinate. I can now filter based on these thresholds.
           
           2.  **Rotation = pi/4 radians (45 degrees):**
               *   Again, determine the safe x and y ranges.
               *   In this case, I will need to use a slightly different half size when calculating the bounds.
               *   Calculate the bounds for collision-free placements.
               *   Again, filter the points.
           
               *I have x_values_pi_4, y_values_pi_4- these are the values for placement to be at pi/4 radians - x and y should be >= or be <= some threshold.*
           
               *   For the x-coordinate of object 4 to not collide: `x + (obj_4_width+obj_4_height)/2 * sqrt(2) <= obj5_x_min` OR `x - (obj_4_width+obj_4_height)/2 * sqrt(2) >= obj5_x_max`
               *   And the y-coordinate: `y + (obj_4_width+obj_4_height)/2 * sqrt(2) <= obj5_y_min` OR `y - (obj_4_width+obj_4_height)/2 * sqrt(2) >= obj5_y_max`
               *   I did the calculation, the result is the thresholds for x-coordinate and y-coordinate. I can now filter based on these thresholds.
           
           3.  **Generate Candidate Placements:**
               *   I'll generate a grid of potential x and y coordinates for both rotations (0 and pi/4).
               *   Then, I'll filter that to make sure each placement is within the non-collision boundaries calculated above.
           
           4.  **Collision Check:**
               *   I'll define a function to check if two AABBs (object 4's and object 5's) overlap. If the boxes overlap, it's a collision. I need to make sure this correctly assesses if there is an overlap in either dimension.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 7**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to place object ID 7 fifty times on surface `surf_0`.  I've got two other objects, ID 5 and ID 4, already placed, so I need to make sure I don't bump into them. The surface is a 0.27m square, centered at the origin.
           
           First, I'm going to look at the other objects. Object 5 is near the bottom left, and object 4 is near the bottom center.
           
           For Object 7 (dimensions 0.089 x 0.089):
           
           1.  **Zero Rotation (theta = 0):**  I'll place object 7 "horizontally." The valid center x and y values for placement without exceeding surface are from -0.0903 to 0.0903. The placement region will be above and to the left of these existing objects (where coordinates should be between  [-0.08, 0.08] for `x`, and [0.02, 0.08] for `y`). It's important to keep the coordinates of the proposed center of object 7 at the given values within the surface. I'll make sure there are no collisions with object 5 (right side) and object 4 (top side).
           
           2.  **Rotation (theta = pi/4):** Now, I rotate object 7 by 45 degrees. The valid center x and y values for placement without exceeding surface are from -0.0718 to 0.0718. The proposed `x` values in this situation are in the interval -0.06 to 0.06. Proposed `y` values are within [0.04, 0.06]. The primary requirement is that `y` values must be at least 0.031083 to be collision-free.
           
           I'll then combine these results and generate 50 distinct object-placement coordinates that should be stable and avoid collisions.

(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements for Object 6 on Surface `surf_0`**
           
           Alright, I need to come up with 50 stable placements for this new object (ID 6). The constraints are pretty straightforward: no collisions with the existing objects (IDs 5, 4, and 7), and everything has to fit neatly on surface `surf_0`.  I have all the AABB data for those existing objects, so I will ensure that the generated placement's AABB does not overlap.
           
           First, I'm going to consider two orientations: `theta = 0` (aligned) and `theta = pi/4` (rotated). For each, I'll calculate the valid center ranges based on the surface dimensions and the object's dimensions, and then iterate through potential `(x, y)` coordinates to check for collision.
           
           For the `theta = 0` case, after calculations, I determined I need to generate placement coordinates from region `[0.0105, 0.0891]` and `[0.0138, 0.0891]`. I will make sure the range is [0.01, 0.02, 0.03, ... 0.08] for x and y. I will generate 64 points, and pick 30 points. For `theta = pi/4`, it seems that generating placements in a smaller region works, I will generate placements for the region `x` in `[0.0295, 0.0701]` and `y` in `[0.0328, 0.0701]`. I will pick points from `x = [0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07]` and `y = [0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07]`, which generates 20 points.

I will make sure the range is [0.01, 0.02, 0.03, ... 0.08] for x and y. I will generate 64 points, and pick 30 points. For `theta = pi/4`, it seems that generating placements in a smaller region works, I will generate placements for the region `x` in `[0.0295, 0.0701]` and `y` in `[0.0328, 0.0701]`. I will pick points from `x = [0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07]` and `y = [0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07]`, which generates 20 points.
           

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Placement Strategies for Object ID 6**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing another instance of object ID 6 on surface `surf_0`. It's a tricky situation because there are a ton of pre-existing obstacles, and I'm basically trying to fit another "nearly-square" object into a very cramped space. I've got to find 50 stable placements, and I'm treating any previously *successful* placement of ID 6 as a fixed obstacle.  This means the scene is already crowded, and it's getting even tighter.
           
           I've carefully calculated the bounding boxes (AABBs) for all the fixed obstacles in the scene. I know it includes objects 5, 4, and 7, as well as every single previously successful placement of object 6.  My plan is to try to place the object with theta = 0 and theta = pi/4 in order to fill the remaining space.
           
           The main challenge is that with all these fixed obstacles and the already-filled region, there isn't a lot of "free" space left.  I've realized that I need to be ultra-precise.  I had to go over the whole area with a much smaller step size to find any gaps that are large enough to fit the new instance.  My method is to scan the available range, checking for overlaps with obstacles at each location.
           
           I have adjusted my strategy to find these small gaps. The updated approach involved iterating through candidate coordinates within the bounds of the surface, generating bounding boxes for each candidate instance, and then comparing them against the AABBs of all fixed obstacles.  It is the most reliable way to find the requested number of non-colliding locations.
