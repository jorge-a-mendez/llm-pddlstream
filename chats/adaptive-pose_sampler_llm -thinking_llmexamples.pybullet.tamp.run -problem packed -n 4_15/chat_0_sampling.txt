(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 4 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to determine 50 stable placements for object ID 4 on surface 0, which requires the object to be fully contained within the surface boundaries.  The object is essentially square-shaped with dimensions of roughly 0.0722 x 0.0722.  Surface 0 is an axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) centered at (0, 0) and extends 0.135 in both x and y directions.
           
           To ensure stability, I've considered the object's rotation (theta) and its position (x, y) relative to the surface. Rotating the object changes its effective AABB dimensions, which I've calculated based on the rotation angle using standard trigonometric formulas.  The key is that for my nearly-square object, the maximum effective size occurs at 45-degree angles to the original and the minimum at 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees. Because the surface is large compared to the object, there will be no issues.
           
           I’ve chosen 6 rotation angles that represent different orientations: 0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, pi/2, and 2*pi/3. For each angle, I calculate the allowable range for the object's center point (x, y) within the surface.  I then place the object at the following points: the center, the four corners, and the midpoints of the sides of the allowed region. That is the x and y coordinates that would encompass the object.  This will give me 54 placements, and since only 50 were requested, I took the first 50.
           
           I didn't have any collisions to worry about since there are no other objects on the surface.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object 5: Navigating Constraints and Ensuring Stability**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new object, object ID 5, that I need to place on surface 0.  But, there's a catch: object ID 4 is already there, and I need to avoid any collisions.  I've got a solid grasp of the surface's dimensions (0.27 x 0.27), and I know object 4's location, size, and rotation. Object 5 is square-ish and a bit larger than Object 4. Now, for Object 5, I have to ensure stability of the placement, so I'm aiming for 50 valid placements for the object.
           
           My primary concern is the potential overlap.  Object 4 is, effectively, a circular region with a radius of approximately 0.036 units.  Object 5, even when rotated, can get "wide" – the effective width (W) is related to the rotation angle (theta). W and H are related and they're equal because this object is square.
           
           The maximum effective width of Object 5 is around 0.130 when rotated by 45 degrees. However, the surface is smaller, the object will fit.
           
           So, to find the 50 placements, I'll restrict the angles to be along the cardinal directions, like 0, pi/2, pi, and 3pi/2.
           
           My strategy involves identifying the valid placement regions for Object 5 relative to Object 4's existing presence.  This means calculating safe zones where the center of Object 5 *must* be located to avoid overlap, I can calculate a safe zone.
           
           I calculated `x` and `y` distances from center which cannot be less than a safe range for object 4. I found a lot of safe points, so the strategy appears valid.
           
           Finally, I plan to combine multiple valid regions and angles.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing 50 stable instances of this new square object (ID 7) on Surface 0, making sure they don't bump into the existing objects (ID 4 and ID 5). I'm approaching this like a spatial detective, carefully mapping out where the object's center can and can't go. Here's the game plan:
           
           1.  **Understand the playing field:** First, I'm taking stock of the fixed objects, noting their positions, extents (essentially, how big they are), and AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box - a simplified rectangular shape that fully encloses the object, and is very useful in quickly detecting overlap). Surface 0 defines the boundaries of the space, giving me limits for where I can place Object 7's center.
           
           2.  **Rotation is Key**: The Object 7 is going to rotate a little. To consider the area Object 7 occupies, I use rotation to calculate `obj7_hw_rot` and `obj7_hh_rot`, the object's effective half-width and half-height for *any* given rotation.
           
           3.  **Forbidden Zones:** Next, I'm figuring out the "forbidden zones" – areas where Object 7's center *cannot* be located due to collisions. There are two types:
               *   **Surface boundaries** are the hard limits of the workspace.
               *   **Collisions with other objects** (ID 4 and ID 5) will define the "safe" placement regions.
           
               I need to define the forbidden zones for Object 7's center `(x7, y7)`. To avoid collision, I need to check these rules:
               *   `abs(x7 - C4_x) >= obj7_hw_rot + obj4_hx` OR `abs(y7 - C4_y) >= obj7_hh_rot + obj4_hy`
               *   `abs(x7 - C5_x) >= obj7_hw_rot + obj5_hx` OR `abs(y7 - C5_y) >= obj7_hh_rot + obj5_hy`
           
               By defining the safe and forbidden spaces, I will have a more comprehensive understanding of the placement spaces.
           
           4.  **Angle of attack**: I need to examine the Object 7's valid positions for the 2 most informative angles: `theta=0` and `theta=pi/2`.
           
           5.  **Placement Point Generation**: I'm going to carefully select placement points:
               *   To do this, I will create a set of points (x, y) coordinates for the object's center, which I will sort and filter, and then calculate what placement points are safe or not with the help of the method: `is_valid(x, y, theta)`.
           
           6.  **Find the 50 Placements:** The objective is to return the valid combinations that satisfy all the collision and rotation requirements.
           
           Ultimately, I'm creating a map, identifying the spaces where Object 7 can safely take up residence without causing any spatial disturbances.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable positions for object 6, which is a new square-like object, on surface 0.  I have to avoid any collisions with the existing objects 4, 5, and 7 already there.
           
           First, let's break down the problem.  Surface 0 has the boundaries: (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). I know object 6 has dimensions of (0.084, 0.084).  I'll rotate object 6 by theta=0 and pi/2 for the most efficient use of space.  With these rotations, I know object 6's AABB will be of side length 0.0420634492.  This gives the max allowed x and y values for the center of object 6 (x6, y6) to be (±0.0929365508, ±0.0929365508) based on the surface containment.
           
           Now, for collision avoidance. I have to make sure the center of object 6 is sufficiently far away from other objects.  First, let's look at object 4. I need object 6's center to be at least 0.078155605 away from object 4's center at (0,0).  So if abs(x6) >= 0.078155605 or abs(y6) >= 0.078155605, then there is no collision.
           
           Next is object 5.  This one is placed at (-0.088812, -0.088812), and I need a 0.0882510902 buffer zone. I can't let x6 and y6 be in the range [-0.0929365508, -0.00056126877918581), otherwise a collision occurs.
           
           Then, there's object 7.  It's at (-0.0876755693, -0.0414879283), and the minimum separation is 0.0893878799.  I will avoid collisions by making x6 > 0.0017123106 or y6 > 0.0478999516.
           
           For the rotations like pi/4, I'm finding that the AABB increases due to the rotation, and I cannot fit it while avoiding all other objects.  So I'll just use the theta=0 and pi/2 placements.
           
           To find the positions, I will do a systematic scan. I will create a grid of (x, y) coordinates within the surface bounds.  I'll use a fairly dense grid (step size of 0.005) to ensure I have enough coverage. I'll filter out the coordinates from my grid that cause object 6 to collide with objects 4, 5, or 7. I will test each (x6, y6) against my conditions. If the conditions are met, the point is added to the valid set and this point is a placement. Once I find 50 of these valid positions, I am done.  Since I am using the dense grid approach, I should find them easily.
