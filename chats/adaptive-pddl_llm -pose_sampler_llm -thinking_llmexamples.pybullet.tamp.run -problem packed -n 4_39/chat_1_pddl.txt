           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Problem Analysis and Unreachability**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a planning problem where I need to arrange several objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`) onto a surface (`v18`). The initial state specifies that these objects are currently supported by and *on* another surface (`v11`). The goal is to get all these objects "on" `v18`. From the available facts, it looks like there's a specific pose (`#o2`) that would work, as all these objects can be supported by `v18` at that pose. The primary challenge is that I'm only given *one* action instance: a "move_base" action that effectively does nothing, as it moves the robot's base to the *same* configuration.
           
           Based on the information, it looks like the planning task is structured around manipulating robot arm to pick and place objects. However, *no pick or place actions* are explicitly provided, and the problem description clearly states I can only use actions from the given list. This is the crucial point.
           
           To achieve `on(?o, v18)`, I'd typically need to pick the object from its current location (in this case, `v11`) and place it at the target pose (`#o2` on `v18`). However, without `pick` and `place` instances, I can't modify the objects' locations; I am unable to manipulate the `atpose` facts.  Therefore, I'm stuck with the initial state and cannot change the objects’ poses from their locations on `v11`.
           
           Since the `move_base` action doesn't change anything relevant to the `on` predicate, and I'm restricted to using *only* that action, the goal is definitively *unachievable*.  My expertise in planning tells me there's no way to reach the desired state with the current constraints.  There is no path to move the objects and I should explain why the goal is not reachable.
