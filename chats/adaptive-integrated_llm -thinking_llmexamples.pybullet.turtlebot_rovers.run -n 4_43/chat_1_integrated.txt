           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Fulfilling the Axiom: A Detailed Plan**
           
           My goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. This means ensuring several conditions are met, starting with objects being in a specific initial state. Specifically, the rovers v12 and v14 are at initial configurations (v13 and v15, respectively), and both store v16 is free for the beginning.
           
           The core of the axiom involves image acquisition and analysis of rocks and soil. I have identified the necessary components: receiving images of objectives v17, v18, v19, and v20, plus receiving analyses for stone (type v2) and soil (type v6) samples.
           
           For imaging, I'll leverage rover v14. To achieve the imaging targets, I must perform several actions. It is worth noticing I have to account for returning rover v14 to it's original location (v15).
           
           1.  **Move** v14 from v15 to #o3 (move action, needs trajectory)
           2.  **Calibrate** the camera v10 on v14 at configuration #o3 (calibration action).
           3.  **Take Images:** Acquire images of the objectives v17, v18, v19, and v20 using the camera, mode v11 (take image action).
           4.  **Send Images:** Once the images are captured, move from #o3 to #o0. Then send the image to lander v9 (send image action).
           
           My plan must then process the analysis. I am aware that I must return rover v14 to its initial state to satisfy all goal constraints.
           
           1.  **Move** from #o0 to #o5 for the rock samples
           2.  **Sample** rock v1 (type v2 stone) and the sample container v16 becomes full.
           3.  **Drop** the sample from the store container, which returns v16 to a free state.
           4.  **Sample** the soil type v5 and make sample container full
           5.  **Drop** the sample from the container, which returns v16 to a free state.
           6.  **Move** v14 back to configuration #o0
           7.  **Send** Analysis for rocks
           
           Now all the goal conditions (images and analysis) are met, and the key *initial* state requirements will be true at the final state.
           
           Continuous values (the specific location coordinates) must be provided in my plan:
           -   `#o0` needs to permit `v14` to transmit to the lander. The position for this would be the initial position `v15` of `v14`.
           -   `#o3` needs to allow for all image targets. Since images are in the same plane, the best estimation would be around the same level as the image targets.
           -   `#o5` needs to be in line with the two sample points of interest. It is expected to be a common point.

           For imaging, I'll leverage rover v14. To achieve the imaging targets, I must perform several actions. It is worth noticing I have to account for returning rover v14 to it's original location (v15).
           
           1.  **Move** v14 from v15 to #o3 (move action, needs trajectory)
           2.  **Calibrate** the camera v10 on v14 at configuration #o3 (calibration action).
           3.  **Take Images:** Acquire images of the objectives v17, v18, v19, and v20 using the camera, mode v11 (take image action).
           4.  **Send Images:** Once the images are captured, move from #o3 to #o0. Then send the image to lander v9 (send image action).
           
           My plan must then process the analysis. I am aware that I must return rover v14 to its initial state to satisfy all goal constraints.
           
           1.  **Move** from #o0 to #o5 for the rock samples
           2.  **Sample** rock v1 (type v2 stone) and the sample container v16 becomes full.
           3.  **Drop** the sample from the store container, which returns v16 to a free state.
           4.  **Sample** the soil type v5 and make sample container full
           5.  **Drop** the sample from the container, which returns v16 to a free state.
           6.  **Move** v14 back to configuration #o0
           7.  **Send** Analysis for rocks
           
           Now all the goal conditions (images and analysis) are met, and the key *initial* state requirements will be true at the final state.
           
           Continuous values (the specific location coordinates) must be provided in my plan:
           -   `#o0` needs to permit `v14` to transmit to the lander. The position for this would be the initial position `v15` of `v14`.
           -   `#o3` needs to allow for all image targets. Since images are in the same plane, the best estimation would be around the same level as the image targets.
           -   `#o5` needs to be in line with the two sample points of interest. It is expected to be a common point.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating Configurations for a Successful Plan**
           
           Okay, the previous plan failed, and it's time to get this right. The issues were pretty clear: configurations `#o3` and `#o5` were either colliding with something or simply unreachable. I need to find a new spot for my rover, `v14`, for imaging and sampling.
           
           First, I need to nail down a collision-free and reachable spot for `v14` to image the objectives: `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`. The problem is, these objectives are all clustered around `y=2`, and the obstacle `v21` is a thin wall right along `x=0`.  So, I can't just put `v14` at `(0.0, 0.0)` for `#o3` like I wanted.
           
           I need a new strategy for `#o3`.  Since the camera has a limited range (2 units, if I remember correctly), being close to the objectives seems important. But the `x=0` constraint is making this tricky. I tried `(0.1, 0.1)`, but the distance to the objectives was just too great.  Based on the PDDL initial state, a single configuration `#o3` *must* be capable of seeing all four objectives simultaneously, since the predicate `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, <obj>)` exists for each. The question is, how wide is the camera's field of view? If I can assume my `theta` will adjust, then just being within range and clear of the wall is sufficient.  I'm going to set `(#o3 v14): (0.1, 0.0)`, which is collision-free and hopefully close enough to image all the objectives. Given the previous error, I know that  `(0.0,0.0)` is blocked, and this solves for the `v21` constraints.
           
           Next up, I need a good location for sampling the rocks. Previously, I had `#o5` at `(0.66, -0.66)`, but the plan couldn't reach that location. I need to make sure this is reachable from the starting point `(-1.0, -1.75)`.  The rocks `v1` and `v5` are far apart, which makes this even tougher. The condition `above(v14, #o5, v1)` and `above(v14, #o5, v5)` both need to be true. My assumption is that the rover's arm can reach these targets. I have to select a base configuration for the arm, where it can swing to be above both these targets, which is why the rocks are so close. The previous position clearly did not work, it was marked as not reachable. I'll need a different position. Given `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)` and rocks `v1` and `v5` are roughly near `x = (1.8, -0.5) ` and `x = (-0.5, -0.7)`, I'll try putting `#o5` at `(0.1, -1.0)`.
           
           That's my new strategy. This should get around those errors. And, finally the communications is a simple one, I just use the initial state as my configuration.
           
           In summary:
           *   `(#o0 v14): (-1.0, -1.75)`  (Communication)
           *   `(#o3 v14): (0.1, 0.0)`  (Imaging)
           *   `(#o5 v14): (0.1, -1.0)`  (Sampling)

(Thoughts: **My Revised Plan: Addressing Feedback and Configuration Issues**
           
           Alright, let's get this plan back on track! After reviewing the feedback, it seems I need to make some key adjustments to the rover's configurations. The primary concern is ensuring that all the continuous parameters I've defined are reachable, collision-free, and satisfy the relevant predicates in the PDDL domain. Here's my updated approach:
           
           1.  **Reaching the Lander (comvisible - #o0):** The initial plan had a configuration `#o0` set at `(-1.0, -1.75)`, but it seems this might be unreachable from the rover's initial position (`v14`). Since the prompt expects `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` to be true, and `v9` is at approximately `(-1.8, -2.0)`, I'll set `#o0` to `(-1.5, -2.0)`. This should be closer to the lander and hopefully, reachable.
           
           2.  **Imaging Pose and Collision Avoidance (imagevisible - #o3):** The previous configuration for `#o3` caused a collision. The objective is to achieve `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` (and also for `v18, v19, v20`). `v21` is an obstacle that blocks x-coordinates in the range `(-0.05, 0.05)`. To avoid this, I'm setting `#o3` to `(0.6, 1.0)`. The `y` value is adjusted to be at `y=1`. This value aims to ensure the objectives are within the camera's view.
           
           3.  **Sampling Rocks (above - #o5):** The issue here is about defining the rover's pose relative to sampling the rocks (`above(v14, #o5, Rock)`). The original configuration of `(0.1, -1.0)` was incorrect.  The prompt made it clear I needed to provide a value for `#o5`. I'm going with `#o5`: `(0.6, -0.7)`. I am setting up the ray parameter with `#o2` for type of motion.
           
           **Key Considerations and Assumptions:**
           
           *   I'm assuming that the `imagevisible` constraint, with a maximum distance of 2, will be satisfied by the chosen configurations. I've chosen `y = 1` for `#o3`.
           *   Although `above` doesn't explicitly involve a "ray," I'm using `#o2` for a generic "motion ray."
           
           **Plan Structure - Unchanged**
           
           *   Move to imaging pose.
           *   Calibrate, take image (x4).
           *   Move to comms pose.
           *   Send images (x4).
           *   Move to sampling pose.
           *   Sample rock 1, drop rock 1.
           *   Sample rock 2, drop rock 2.
           *   Move to comms pose.
           *   Send analyses (x2).
           *   Move back to initial pose.
           
           Let's hope these revised configurations address the feedback and allow the rover to successfully complete its mission!

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Plan and Configurations**
           
           Okay, so I've got this plan for `new-axiom@0()`, and I need to tweak it because of those pesky collision issues from before. Specifically:
           
           1.  That initial comms configuration, `#o0`, for `v14` and `v9` was too close to the lander. I need a new spot that's *outside* the lander's bounding box.
           2.  The imaging configuration, `#o3`, wasn't reachable.
           3.  The sampling configuration, `#o5`, also wasn't working.
           
           So, I'm going back through everything, looking at the initial and final states of each object and the given predicates. The goal is to make sure I can reach the imaging targets, send an analysis of rock and soil, then return to the starting position.
           
           **Revisiting Configurations:**
           
           *   **`#o3` (Imaging):** This one needs a strategic overhaul. I need to make sure I can see the objectives (v17, v18, v19, and v20) while avoiding that pesky obstacle (v21) which is a vertical wall at x = 0. My initial thought was to use (1.0, 1.0) because it looked like it could see the objectives, but it didn't quite work. It was too far away. Now, I'm thinking a point to the left of the wall could do the trick. Now I want to try `(-0.5, 1.0)`. *Because imagevisible is defined in the initial state, I just need to find a collision free, reachable configuration.*
           *   **`#o0` (Comms):** The previous try was inside the lander's AABB. I'll need to go just below the lander, at `(-1.0, -2.5)`. This should be reachable and, crucially, outside the bounding box.
           *   **`#o5` (Sampling):** My initial guess didn't work. The goal is to be above the rock, which suggests I need to be close to where the rock is so the `above` predicate will work. I am going to try `(1.0, -1.0)`. This also avoids the wall.
           
           **Re-evaluating the Plan**
           
           My initial plan structure is basically sound. I just need new valid configurations for communication, imaging, and sampling.
           
           The overall goal is:
           
           1.  Image objectives (using `v14`).
           2.  Communicate with the lander (`v9`).
           3.  Sample rocks and soil.
           4.  Return to the initial configuration.
           
           **Key Thoughts:**
           *   For the imaging, I need a point that helps view the goals without collision.
           *   For the coms, I need to make sure the configuration is reachable.
           *   For the sampling, I need a point that allows the `above` predicate to be satisfied.
           
           I'm confident I can make this plan work with these new coordinates. Let's see it happen!

           *   **`#o5` (Sampling):** My initial guess didn't work. The goal is to be above the rock, which suggests I need to be close to where the rock is so the `above` predicate will work. I am going to try `(1.0, -1.0)`. This also avoids the wall.
           
           **Re-evaluating the Plan**
           
           My initial plan structure is basically sound. I just need new valid configurations for communication, imaging, and sampling.
           
           The overall goal is:
           
           1.  Image objectives (using `v14`).
           2.  Communicate with the lander (`v9`).
           3.  Sample rocks and soil.
           4.  Return to the initial configuration.
           
           **Key Thoughts:**
           *   For the imaging, I need a point that helps view the goals without collision.
           *   For the coms, I need to make sure the configuration is reachable.
           *   For the sampling, I need a point that allows the `above` predicate to be satisfied.
           
           I'm confident I can make this plan work with these new coordinates. Let's see it happen!
           

User:      Configuration #o0 = (-1.0 -2.5) for rover v14 at target v9 is in collision with the following fixed obstacles:
           
           ```
           v22: AABB(lower=(-2.55, -2.55, 0.0), upper=(2.55, -2.45, 0.1))
           ```
           
           Configuration #o3 = (-0.5 1.0) for rover v14 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (-0.5 1.0) for rover v14 at target v18 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (-0.5 1.0) for rover v14 at target v19 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (-0.5 1.0) for rover v14 at target v20 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration (#o5 v14): (1.0 -1.0) is not in the correct format. Please provide each configuration in the format `(<pose_name> <rover_name> <ray_name> <target_name>): (<x> <y>)`.
           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **My Current Strategy: Navigating the Obstacles**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback, and it's time to refine my plan. The core issue is ensuring that my configurations for various tasks—imaging, communication, and sampling—are collision-free, reachable, and in the correct format. Let's get into the details:
           
           1.  **Imaging (#o3):**  I initially chose a point, but it wasn't reachable. I need to find a single location where my rover can see all four objectives, which are spread out across the space. The key is avoiding the thin wall (`v21`) that runs along the y-axis at x=0.  I've reasoned that a high point like `(-0.6, 1.0)` might be a better choice as it's outside `v21` (x=0) and should be reachable. I'm hoping that being on the same "side" of `v21` makes a difference.
           
           2.  **Communication (#o0):**  The goal is to communicate with the lander (`v9`). It's located around `x=[-2.4, -1.4]`, `y=[-2.3, -1.6]`.  I need a point that's close to `v9` but not colliding. The previous feedback hinted that being directly within the lander's bounding box causes issues. I've chosen a location `(-1.0, -1.0)` for `#o0`, hoping to balance proximity to the lander and avoidance of obstacles.
           
           3.  **Sampling (#o5):** This is the tricky part. I have to sample rocks, one of type `v2` (stone), and one of type `v6` (soil). These rocks are spread across the space, with the objective for sampling (`v2` and `v6`) being at coordinates such that both locations cannot be sampled given that the wall `v21` is an obstacle. I've tried multiple configurations, but they're either unreachable or lead to conflicts. The main hurdle is the `above` predicate, which seems to imply that I must be "near" both rocks from a *single* configuration. Given the physical layout of the rocks and the obstacle, this is nearly impossible. I'll need to assume that the rover position (the base) must be reachable, and trust that the system will find a path to a point, say `(-1.0, -0.7)` or `(0.1, -1.0)` that enables sampling of both rocks based on what's stated in the initial state of the problem.
           
           Essentially, I need to place my robot in locations where it can accomplish these tasks in spite of the limited amount of space that's given. It's a tricky geometric problem. Let's see if this revised approach works!
