           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment: Unattainable Goal**
           
           Okay, here's what I've distilled from the information: The primary objective is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` goal, which boils down to achieving two major sub-goals: obtaining images (`receivedimage`) and analyzing samples (`receivedanalysis`). While the initial state provides some necessary conditions (rover positions, free stores), the core issue lies in the limitations imposed on rover movement.
           
           To get the images, I need to use calibration, image taking, and sending actions that *all* require the rovers to be at specific configurations:  `#o3` (for imaging). The `send_analysis` action also requires certain other configurations. Likewise, obtaining the analysis means getting the rovers to  `#o5` to sample rocks. However, I've got a critical constraint: the only available "move" actions keep the rovers at their initial configurations (`v13` for rover `v12` and `v15` for rover `v14`). In other words,  I can't *move* the rovers to those necessary spots.
           
           Thus, because the rovers cannot reach the necessary configurations (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`) for imaging, sampling, or communication, I simply can't fulfill the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` conditions. Since these are *essential* to satisfying the top-level goal (`new-axiom@0()`), the overall task is unreachable given the current action limitations. I am unable to plan any sequence of actions that achieves `new-axiom@0()`.
