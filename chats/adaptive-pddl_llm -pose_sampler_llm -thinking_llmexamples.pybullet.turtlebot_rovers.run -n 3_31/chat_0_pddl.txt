           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment & Problem Breakdown**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a pretty specific goal in this `rovers` domain.  I can see immediately that this axiom is all about having images and analyses received.  Specifically, it wants us to have received three images (`receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`) and some rock and soil analysis results (`receivedanalysis(?stone)`, `receivedanalysis(?soil)`. The first four conditions `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, and `free(v14, v16)` are already met in the initial state.
           
           **Deep Dive into `receivedimage` & Analysis**
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`, I'll need to use the `send_image` action. To use `send_image`, I need `haveimage`.  And to get `haveimage`, I'll need `take_image`, which in turn requires `calibrated`. So, the path is to calibrate, take images, and then send them.  The domain has two rovers, `v12` at `v13` and `v14` at `v15`, plus a camera `v10` supported by both. The objective seems to be to analyze image objectives `v17`, `v18`, `v19`. I've got a plan sketched out, but I'm pausing. The `imagevisible` predicate uses `#o3` and `imagevisible` is a precondition of both `calibrate` and `take_image`, so I need to check where that config fits in.
           
           **Major Problem: Action Availability**
           
           *Critical Error!* I missed something essential.  I was so focused on planning the image-taking and transmission steps, that I didn't verify the actions that I can *actually use* to complete the objective! The only actions available are: move and drop\_rock.  Specifically, rovers can move and they can drop rocks. There are *no* `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` actions available!
           
           **Unreachable Conclusion**
           
           The `new-axiom@0()` goal is impossible to reach.  Without the ability to take images or perform rock/soil analysis, the critical `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` conditions simply cannot be satisfied, no matter what.  The objective is fundamentally unreachable, given the limited actions.  The move and drop\_rock actions don't allow for the goal to be fulfilled.
