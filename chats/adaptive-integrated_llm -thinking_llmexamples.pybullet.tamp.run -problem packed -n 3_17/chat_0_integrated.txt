User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.12, -0.578), (-0.03, -0.487)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.075, -0.532, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.563, 0.826).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.144, -0.295), (0.241, -0.198)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.242, 0.535, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.328, 0.945).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.193, 0.486), (0.291, 0.584)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.193, -0.247, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.881, 0.473).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom atpose(v14, v15)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom arm(v6)

           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom stackable(v14, v16)
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of Achieving the Goal**
           
           Okay, I've got a problem. The instructions are clear: I'm trying to arrange objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto surface `v16`.  My initial state is that these objects are currently supported by `v11` at poses `v9`, `v13`, and `v15` respectively.  The goal, from a logical standpoint, necessitates that I pick up each object and place it on `v16` which means the atpose needs to be updated. This would be accomplished via actions `pick` and `place`.
           
           Now, here's where it gets tricky. The rules say I can *only* use actions from a pre-defined list.  I've analyzed the needed preconditions for `pick` and `place` actions which require preconditions.  That means I would have to make actions such as `pick(v6, v8, v9, #o1, v3, <traj_v8_pick>)` and `place(v6, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, <traj_v8_place>)`, but the action list only contains `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This is problematic.
           
           I re-read the instructions carefully. The constraints are very strict: if an action isn't on the list, it's off-limits.  The provided `move_base` action alone is not sufficient to change the pose of any objects.
           
           In other words, since I *must* change the pose of each object to satisfy the goal, I *must* use `pick` and `place`, but I'm *prohibited* from using them. It's a contradiction!  
           
           Essentially, I cannot change the position of `v8`, `v12`, or `v14` with the restricted action set, making the goal logically unreachable. The constraints presented in this problem inherently render the stated goal impossible to solve.
