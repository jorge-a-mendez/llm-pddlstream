User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding three suitable base positions for a robot, given a target point at (0, 0). The robot's got a max range of 2 units from the target, and its orientation will automatically face the target, so that's handled. The real challenge here is avoiding collisions with the fixed obstacles in the environment *and* maintaining a clear line of sight to the target. We're also constrained to an operational area defined by x and y coordinates between -2.5 and 2.5.
           
           **Visualizing the Obstacle Landscape**
           
           I've got a mental image of the environment now. There's a vertical wall right at x = 0 that essentially splits the space. And it's not just a blank canvas; there's a bunch of smaller rectangular obstacles scattered around, creating tight spots and potential occlusion points. The main challenge is this x=0 wall (obstacle 5: x = [-0.05, 0.05]). Given that the target is smack dab at (0,0), right on this wall, that's where the real headache begins!
           
           **Tackling the Line-of-Sight Conundrum**
           
           If the target is truly at (0,0) and the x=0 wall blocks line of sight, well, that's game over. Any position (x, y) with x != 0 won't have a direct, unblocked view of the target. To make it work, I must assume some kind of system flexibility here: either the target is considered visible from *one side* of the wall, or the wall has a "viewing window" at the target, or something along those lines. With the target *inside* the wall, as it is, it's pretty much a given.
           
           **Devising a Strategy and Exploring Potential Solutions**
           
           I'm interpreting the problem so that as long as I can provide a set of coordinates where the robot is *near* this obstacle, it might work, and the rest can be handled by a line-of-sight test later. I've broken the strategy into:
           
           1.  **Placement near the obstacle at a close range**: One robot's position will have coordinates (0.1, 0.0). X = 0.1, so it is just outside the central wall. I am hoping to test the line-of-sight at this close-up.
           
           2.  **Farther, same direction**: (1.5, 0.0) is another good candidate with the caveat mentioned.
           
           3.  **Third point (x,y)**: (1.0, 1.0). Same constraint applies.
           
           So there it is! Three coordinates, (0.1, 0.0), (1.5, 0.0) and (1.0, 1.0). I will submit them.
