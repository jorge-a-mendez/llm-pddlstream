           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning**
           
           I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 4, dimensions approximately 0.091 x 0.091) on a square surface (surface 0, bounds -0.135 to 0.135). A placement is deemed "stable" if the object is fully contained within the surface boundaries.
           
           I'll calculate the new dimensions of the object (rotated bounding box) by rotating the object by `theta` as `rotated_s` based on the given formula.  The surface is a square of side 0.27 centered at (0,0).  Stability criteria is then defined as ensuring that the object's center plus/minus half the rotated side length remains within the surface bounds.
           
           Given the square nature of both the object and the surface, I can generate a diverse set of placements by varying both the rotation angle (`theta`) and the object's position (x, y) within the surface. The object is symmetric.  Given the symmetry, i know the maximum rotated side will appear at 45 degree multiples.
           
           My strategy involves:
           
           1.  Selecting 10 different `theta` values that provide diverse rotations, particularly focusing on the first quadrant, but spanning `2*pi` to ensure all orientations are represented. This ensures different rotated object dimensions.
           2.  For each `theta`, I'll calculate the valid ranges for `x` and `y` within the surface bounds, taking into account the rotation angle (`theta`).
           3.  Within these ranges, for each angle, I will pick 5 positions using the (0,0) as a starting center position, and 4 other corner positions relative to the minimum and maximum coordinate boundary calculation.  This ensures I cover the entire bounds.
           4. I will then use each combination of (theta, position) to generate 50 unique placements as asked.
           
           This methodical approach ensures I provide a comprehensive and diverse set of stable placements, covering various orientations and positions within the surface's boundaries. The math to check placement validity is straightforward and already described.  I will take care with precision and rounding as appropriate, as a matter of good practice.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Avoiding Collision**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed object 4, a square of side 0.09107, at (0, 0) with a rotation of 0 degrees on surface 0. Now I need to place object 5, another square but with side 0.08476674584057453. My goal is to generate 50 stable placements for it on the same surface, but crucially, I must avoid any collisions with the existing object 4.  Surface 0 spans from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           My strategy is to utilize 10 different angles, and for each of these angles try 5 placements to give a final 50. I need to handle cases where there will be overlapping AABB extents. I'll need to calculate the rotated square sides correctly for any angle and compare that rotated dimension to the surface size, avoiding placements that would leave object 5 in collision. The central issue is that object 4 occupies a region around (0,0), and I need to *exclude* that region.
           
           Let's break down the approach:  The key is to determine if object 5's placement, specifically its center (x, y) coordinates, with its rotation, has any AABB extents, or intervals, that collide with object 4. I know the position of object 4, and the bounds of the placement surface. I need to make sure I avoid overlap. To avoid collision, I need to check for non-overlap. 
           
           I'll use a series of steps to calculate valid placements:
           
           1.  **Calculate Rotated Size:** For each angle (theta), I'll calculate the new AABB rotated size for object 5.
           2.  **Determine Forbidden Zone:** Using Object 4's location, I'll calculate the "forbidden zone" - the area around object 4 where object 5's center *cannot* be.
           3.  **Surface Bounds Check:** Considering the rotation, I'll compute the allowed ranges for x and y placement *within* the surface area. I need to make sure the object's sides stay inside the surface boundary.
           4.  **Collision Check:** I'll determine if it is even possible to avoid collision at all! To make sure the object sides will stay inside the box! I must calculate the extreme bounds for the rotation and surface, and then avoid overlapping the extents. It might be impossible for an orientation.
           
           The core of the logic is to determine ranges where I can place object 5. The basic approach is to make sure:
           - object 5's x is NOT inside object 4's x-interval AND
           - object 5's y is NOT inside object 4's y-interval.
           
           I'll check the surface constraints by setting up the equation, and I will be sure the solution of the formula includes all the correct cases: surface x and y bounds combined with collision-avoidance.
           
           For this problem the angles are limited to avoid the overlapping extents.  I have calculated that I need to be careful with orientations: angles close to 0 and pi/2. To get 50 points, I will use:
            * 6 Angles near 0,
            * 4 angles near pi/2
            * The remaining angles will be distributed across the interval, checking to make sure that the intervals are not too near each other.
           
           For the placements, 
           1. I will place the object in the corners of the valid space.
           2. The remaining placement I'll set to be near (-0.09, 0)
           With these steps, I should be able to ensure all the placements are stable and collision-free.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable locations for object ID 6 on surface 0, while ensuring no collisions with existing objects (ID 4 and ID 5). I'm approaching this systematically, leveraging my understanding of bounding boxes and rotational constraints.
           
           First, I define key parameters: the size of object 6 (`s_obj_6`), and the dimensions of object 4 and 5 AABB. I also note the surface bounds.
           
           The plan involves:
           
           1.  **Angle Iteration:** I'll loop through a set of carefully selected angles (`theta`) from 0 to π/2, using values:  0, π/8, π/4, 3π/8, π/2, 5π/8, 3π/4, 7π/8, π, 9π/8.
           2.  **AABB Size Determination:** For each angle, I calculate the rotated bounding box size (`half_s6_rot`) of object 6. This is crucial as it dictates the effective surface area it occupies, which varies with `theta`.
           3.  **Surface Bound and Object Exclusion:** Based on the rotated size, I determine the valid placement region on the surface, accounting for the object's size. Additionally, I define exclusion zones to prevent overlap with object 4 and 5.
           4.  **Placement Point Generation:** I'll generate sets of placements with various `(x, y)` locations for the rotated object. I want to try placements:  top-right, top-left, bottom-right, middle sections of the surface.
           5.  **Collision Checks and Validation:** For each candidate position, I check for potential collisions with objects 4 and 5. I'll use AABB overlap checks to validate each potential placement.
           
           This method should result in a robust set of valid object placements, avoiding the need for a brute-force approach.
