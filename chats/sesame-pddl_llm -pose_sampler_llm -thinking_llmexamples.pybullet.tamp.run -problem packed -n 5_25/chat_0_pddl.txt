(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for a Square Object**
           
           The objective is to find 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5, dimensions: 0.09887115823128756 x 0.09887115823128756) on a square surface (0) defined by the points (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135).  A "stable" placement means the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) is fully contained within the surface's AABB.  To achieve diversity in placement, the plan is to vary the object's position (x, y) and its orientation (theta).
           
           Since both the object and surface are squares, changing theta doesn't affect the *minimum* AABB requirement for containment (at 0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2). These values provide a constant range of valid (x,y) locations because these rotations do not change the dimension of the bounding box. The largest bounding box is created at pi/4, thus (x,y) location is smaller at that orientation.
           
           The object's half-extents (obj_size / 2) determine the inner boundaries for x and y:
           *  x_min = -0.135 + 0.09887115823128756 / 2 = -0.08556442088435622
           *  x_max = 0.135 - 0.09887115823128756 / 2 = 0.08556442088435622
           *  Similarly, y_min = -0.08556442088435622 and y_max = 0.08556442088435622
           
           To create the 50 distinct placements, I'll generate a grid of x and y values within these bounds, using a step size of (0.17112884176871244 / 6), which is 0.02852147362811874.  This means the 49 distinct placement (surf_idx, theta, x, y) values are: (0, 0.0, -0.08556442088435622, -0.08556442088435622), and so on with the values added as steps of x_step and y_step as:
           x_vals = [-0.08556442088435622, -0.05704294725623748, -0.02852147362811874, 0.0, 0.02852147362811874, 0.05704294725623748, 0.08556442088435622]
           y_vals = [-0.08556442088435622, -0.05704294725623748, -0.02852147362811874, 0.0, 0.02852147362811874, 0.05704294725623748, 0.08556442088435622]
           We use the same values for x_vals and y_vals and use all possible combinations to create the locations.
           
           The 50th placement will provide diversity by rotating the square object to theta=pi/4, at (0,0).  The center point (0,0) is valid since at pi/4, the x/y ranges are less restrictive, with the same center location.  Thus the 50th location will be at (0, 0.7853981633974483, 0.

(Thoughts: **My Planning for Placing Object 4**
           
           Alright, let's get down to business. I've been tasked with placing a new object (ID 4) on the same surface where a previous object (ID 5) was successfully placed.  The key here is to avoid any collisions. I've got the dimensions and position of Object 5, as well as Object 4: I know Object 5 is located in the bottom-left corner and spans a region.
           
           Here's the plan:
           
           1.  **Understand the playing field**:  I've calculated the dimensions of Object 4 (approximately a square) and the size of the surface, establishing the surface boundaries.  I've precisely calculated the minimum and maximum extents of Object 5 using its position and dimensions.
           
           2.  **Define Collision Avoidance**: I am using Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) to represent each object and have defined the collision criteria to prevent overlap. I also have understood how I need to account for rotation in the bounding box calculation for Object 4 using trigonometric relations. I will create a function that will determine non-overlapping regions for placement.
           
           3.  **Find valid Placements**: I plan to use a grid-based approach to generate potential placements of Object 4, which is currently planned at `theta=0`.  Then, with a small degree of flexibility for rotation at `pi/4` and also at `pi/2`.
           
           4.  **Collision Checking**:  At each potential placement, I'll check if the AABB of Object 4 overlaps with the AABB of Object 5. If there's no overlap, it's a valid placement.
           
           5.  **Placement Strategies**:   I understand that I can only create valid placements that exist in non-overlapping regions. I have to place all non-colliding points within the boundaries of the surface.  Since Object 5's occupies the bottom-left region.  This essentially means that, for a placement `x, y`, I need `x >= (O5_max_x + (O4_max_x - O4_min_x)/2)` or `y >= (O5_max_y + (O4_max_y - O4_min_y)/2)` for the AABB's to not intersect, and to be considered a valid placement.  For `theta=0` and `pi/2`, there will be some valid locations (regions) for placements. For `theta=pi/4`, there is an even smaller number of valid locations.
           
           6.  **Ensure Enough Solutions**: I aim to find and return at least 50 valid placements. If I don't reach 50, I'll need to go back and reassess my grid spacing or explore additional rotations.
           
           7. **The Implementation**: I'm going to set `x` values to increase from 0, and the same for `y`. I will take `theta = 0, pi/4 and pi/2` and populate placements, until I get the full list of 50. I will prioritize `theta = 0`. If I don't get the maximum of these placements, I will add rotation to the available points. I won't need to oversample with `3pi/4` because that will create the same placements as `pi/4`.

(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I need to figure out 50 stable positions for object ID 7 on surface 0, making sure they don't crash into the existing objects, ID 5 and ID 4. This is a classic constrained placement problem.  First things first, I calculate the valid surface area.  The surface is a square: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           I've got the dimensions and current positions of object 5 and object 4, including their rotations (which are currently at 0 degrees), and their AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) extents.  I've already calculated their half-dimensions, centers, and the corners of their bounding boxes. This helps me visualize the occupied space.
           
           **Collision Avoidance is Key**
           
           The fundamental idea is simple:  I'll define a region for object 7 that *cannot* overlap with either object 5's or object 4's bounding boxes.  I'll need to account for object 7's rotation.   I need to calculate the AABB of the new object, especially when it's rotated.  `theta = 0` means no rotation; `theta = pi/4` means a 45-degree rotation. The object size, `obj7_dim`, is 0.07869.
           
           **Rotation and Valid Placement Zones**
           
           I know the surface's total area.  For `theta = 0`, I calculate the valid *x* and *y* range for object 7 considering that I need to keep the object inside the square. I perform the same calculations for the rotated object.  I now have two sets of valid *x* and *y* ranges.
           
           **Grid Search and Collision Checks**
           
           Next, I'll use a grid-based approach to find potential placements. I'll create a grid of points within the valid surface area for `theta = 0`, with the hope of checking the coordinates of the grid points.  For each potential center point, I'll build the AABB and then perform my collision check against the known occupied regions of the existing objects.
           
           I will iterate through all the points on my grid, calculating the bounds of object 7 and checking for collision. My main function will check for collisions between the AABBs.
           
           **Collision Check Function**
           
           I will test collision using a logical AND statement that checks if the min-max values in x- and y-dimensions overlap.
           
           **Population and Refinement**
           For each candidate placement, I check for collision.
           Once I have valid placements, I want to create a diverse and non-overlapping set of 50 candidates, I'll combine the valid placement candidates, making sure the candidates don't collide.

I'm dealing with a surface defined as `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I've already determined the dimensions and AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of each object.
           
           To start, I've calculated the valid placement area for the new object, considering its dimensions (`0.09879522847694688`) and the surface boundaries.  I'll generate placements both at a 0-degree angle (flat) and at a 45-degree angle (rotated). For a 0-degree rotation, the valid placement area on surface 0 is within `[-0.08560238576152656, 0.08560238576152656]` for both x and y.  For 45-degree rotation, the bounds become `[-0.06514825051603815, 0.06514825051603815]`.
           
           I'll use a grid-based approach to explore potential placements.  For the 0-degree orientation, I'll generate a 10x10 grid of points within the valid placement area (covering the ranges -0.0856 to 0.0856). For the 45-degree orientation, I'll generate an 8x8 grid.  Each grid point represents a potential center for placing the object.
           
           I've defined a collision check function using AABBs to determine whether a potential placement overlaps with any of the existing objects. For the new object I generate an AABB and check whether it intersects with the AABBs of objects 5, 4, and 7.  If a potential placement doesn't collide, I'll record it as a valid placement, along with the surface index, rotation angle, x-coordinate, and y-coordinate. I will iterate and choose any valid placement.
           
           Before generating the grid of placements, I've also pre-calculated the AABBs of existing objects and I can use the AABB intersection function to check any collisions very quickly.
           
           Based on the layout of the existing objects, the top-right corner of surface 0 seems like a promising area for placing the new object, particularly for theta = 0, as the objects are concentrated to the lower left.
