           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unachievable**
           
           My analysis indicates that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently unachievable. The main issue stems from the inability to satisfy the `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` subgoals.  This is due to the rovers being static; they can't change their configurations, and therefore cannot sample the rocks that need to be analyzed.
           
           **Detailed Breakdown:**
           
           1.  **Image Acquisition:** I can achieve the image acquisition part of the goal. By using `calibrate` and `take_image`, I can ensure that both `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)` are satisfied.  I can use either rover (v12 and v14) and camera (v10), but for this case I will use v12.
           2.  **Analysis Requirements:** To achieve the analysis requirements, I need to send analysis, which requires me to sample rocks. However, I have identified a significant limitation.
           3.  **Static Rover Constraint:** The available `move` actions are essentially no-ops. Both rovers (v12 and v14) are confined to their starting configurations (v13 and v15, respectively).
           4.  **Configuration Mismatch:** The `sample_rock` action requires that the rover's current configuration matches the configuration required by the `above` predicate. However, all `above` facts available involve config `#o5`, while the rovers are at different configurations in the initial state. Since there is no means to change these configurations, the `sample_rock` action cannot be executed successfully.  Thus, `analyzed(?v, ?r)` will always be false and therefore `receivedanalysis` will also always be false.
           5.  **Unreachable Goal:** Because of this fundamental conflict between the required configuration for sampling and the fixed rover locations, I conclude the goal cannot be achieved. The preconditions for obtaining the analysis of the objects cannot be achieved due to the constraints of the domain.
