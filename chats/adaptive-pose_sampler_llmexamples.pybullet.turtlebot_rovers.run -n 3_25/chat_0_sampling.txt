User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is mostly clear in the center, but there are several obstacles on the perimeter and some small ones scattered throughout. There's a notable vertical obstacle around x=0, and a horizontal obstacle near y=-2.5. Also, there are groups of small obstacles in the top-right, top-left, and bottom-right corners. The robot's x and y range is limited to [-2.5, 2.5]. I need to find positions that are within 2 units of the target point. I will try to find diverse positions that are not too close to the obstacles.
           
           Positions:
           (-0.06313795328140259 -0.06313795328140259)
           (-0.046048590660095215 -0.046048590660095215)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     The previous positions collided with obstacle 5, which is a vertical bar around x=0. I will try to find positions on either side of this obstacle, and also make sure they are within the max_range of 2 from the target point. The target point is (0.419, 1.85).
