(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5, side length ~0.0976) on a square surface (surface 0, bounds: (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135)).  A stable placement requires the object to be fully contained within the surface, and, in this case, no collisions with obstacles or other objects.
           
           Since this object is a square, its bounding box dimensions are constant regardless of rotation.  The key is calculating the valid center range for the square to fit inside the surface.
           
           I've determined that the valid range for the center (x, y) of the square is approximately [-0.08618, 0.08618] for both x and y.  To ensure diverse placements, I'll generate a 7x7 grid of center points within this valid region, resulting in 49 placements. All these points will use a rotation of 0 radians. For the remaining placement, I'll set the center to (0,0) and rotate it by pi/4 radians for a little diversity.
           
           To sum up:
           *   I calculated the valid center range.
           *   I'll generate a grid of x and y coordinates within that range.
           *   I'll default to zero rotation but vary for one placement.
           *   The final result should be 50 stable and distinct configurations.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new request: place object ID 4 on surface 0, avoiding a collision with the previously placed object ID 5, which is now a fixed obstacle at `(0, 0.0, -0.08618120990621667, -0.08618120990621667)`.  I'm dealing with squares here, so the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) is the key.
           
           Here's my thinking:
           
           1.  **Understand the Setup:** Surface 0 has dimensions `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. Object 4 is a square with side length `s4 = 0.08223882113327541`.  Object 5 is also a square, with side length `s5 = 0.09763758018756666`.
           
           2.  **Define Valid Placement Region:** For object 4, I can place its center `(x_c4, y_c4)` anywhere on surface 0 *except* where it would collide with object 5. The basic valid region on the surface is a smaller square within surface 0, taking into account the object's size.
           
           3.  **Calculate the Forbidden Region:** The "collision" is where the AABB of object 4 overlaps the AABB of object 5. Object 5 is fixed at (x_c5, y_c5)  (-0.086...,-0.086...) with the AABB dimensions computed from the side length. So, I need to compute the area taken up by object 5 based on its side length and center point.
           
           4.  **Find the collision region for the center of object 4.** It's a calculation of x and y overlaps. I will then find the valid regions in which to generate the placement candidates.
           
           5.  **Placement strategy is to generate grid points**: Then filter the valid locations. I’m thinking a 9x9 grid on the surface, and remove all colliding locations.
           
           6. **The final result is a list of object placements**, each consisting of an angle (0), the object center coordinates.

(Thoughts: **My Task: Find 50 Stable Placement Locations for a Square Object (ID 8)**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan: I need to figure out 50 spots where I can place this new, square object (ID 8) on a specific surface (Surface 0).  The tricky part? I have to respect the boundaries of Surface 0 and make sure the object doesn't crash into the two other objects already placed there (IDs 5 and 4). It's essentially a constrained packing problem, but I can approach it intelligently.
           
           First things first, I've got the lay of the land, specifically the coordinates of Surface 0: It's a square, bounded by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           Object 8 is also a square, with a side length. I calculate the side length.  Then, I calculate half the side length because I'm thinking about the object's *center* point.  That's key for the next step, making sure I stay *inside* Surface 0.
           
           Now, my main constraint is to keep Object 8 within the Surface 0 boundaries.  I'm using the square shape and its center point to figure out valid ranges for its x and y coordinates.  I know its center's x must be between a minimum and a maximum value, and the same goes for y. This is where I can start building my grid:
           
           Now, I'm armed with the valid area for Object 8.
           
           The real challenge is avoiding collisions. I start by focusing on the locations of the existing objects, calculating their AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box).
           
           First, I calculate the existing object's AABB's
           
           - Object 5: Coordinates and size give me a rectangle that it occupies.
           - Object 4: Do the same for Object 4.
           
           I determine if the AABB's overlap using a collision detection condition between the objects. If they overlap, it's a collision!
           
           After collision detection, I know I must find a viable grid to begin looking for potential locations:
           *  I need to adjust my search to *avoid* overlapping with the existing ones. Essentially, I have to "grow" the existing objects a bit to create forbidden zones.
           *  I'll start with a 15x15 grid of points within the valid placement area for Object 8.
           *  For each point, I check: Does placing the center of Object 8 there cause it to collide with Object 5 or Object 4? (Using my 'collision' check.)
           *  If the center point is clear, I add it to my list of viable spots.
           *  If I find enough good spots, I stop.
           
           This grid-based AABB collision approach should efficiently find 50 safe placements, giving me a solid solution to this placement problem.

(Thoughts: **My plan for Object ID 7 on Surface 0:**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 7) within the confines of Surface 0, ensuring it doesn't collide with existing objects (ID 5, 4, and 8). The surface itself is a simple rectangle, and my first step is to establish the valid placement area for the center of the square, considering its size.  I've calculated the boundaries where the object's center can reside without going over the edge.
           
           Then, I'll need to check for collisions. I've already determined the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of each of the three existing objects. I'll need to run an AABB collision check between each potential placement for Object 7 and the existing objects. A collision occurs if the bounding boxes overlap in both the x and y dimensions. I need to make sure I compute the collision AABB correctly, by accounting for the half-side of object 7 and the extents of object 5, 4, 8.
           
           I'll use a grid-based approach to explore potential placements. I'll create a grid across the valid area of the surface. Each grid point will be a potential center for Object 7. For each grid point, I'll check for collisions with the other three objects. If no collisions are detected, that placement will be considered valid. I'll keep doing this until I find 50 valid placements.
           
           Since the object is a square, there's no need to consider rotations. The AABB won't change with rotation. This significantly simplifies the problem and keeps the processing time down. The problem statement makes it clear that the *AABB* is the defining "geometry" of the object, so I'll interpret "size_x" and "size_y" as the *current* bounding box, and the bounding box won't change if this geometry is rotated because the object is a square.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable positions for a new square object (ID 6) on surface 0, ensuring that it doesn't collide with four previously placed square objects (IDs 5, 4, 8, and 7). I'm treating the objects as Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) to simplify the collision detection.  Here's how I'm approaching this:
           
           1.  **Surface and Object Details:** I'm starting with the dimensions of surface 0, which is a square bounded by (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135).  Object 6 has a known size, s6 = 0.0987, and thus a half-side of s6/2 = 0.049354.
           
           2.  **Valid Placement Area:** For the center of object 6 (x\_c6, y\_c6) to be within surface 0, its x and y coordinates must fall within the range [-0.0856, 0.0856].
           
           3.  **Forbidden Zones:** Using the pre-placed objects' positions and sizes, I calculate each object's AABB. Then I expand these AABBs outwards by s6_half to create forbidden zones.  If object 6's center lands within any of these expanded zones, a collision occurs.
           
           4.  **Grid-Based Search:** I'm creating a 16x16 grid within the valid placement area.  Each grid point represents a candidate center (x\_c, y\_c) for object 6.
           
           5.  **Collision Check Function:** I've written a function to efficiently determine if a candidate center results in a collision.  This function takes the candidate center (x\_c, y\_c) and checks if the corresponding AABB of object 6 overlaps with any of the previously placed objects' AABBs.
           
           6.  **Valid Position Selection:**  I iterate through the grid, and only consider a candidate placement as valid if the center (x\_c, y\_c) is *not* located in the expanded forbidden regions. I then collect the first 50 valid placements.

Model:     **Object Placement Strategy**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable positions for a new square object (ID 6) on surface 0, ensuring that it doesn't collide with four previously placed square objects (IDs 5, 4, 8, and 7). I'm treating the objects as Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) to simplify the collision detection.  Here's how I'm approaching this:
