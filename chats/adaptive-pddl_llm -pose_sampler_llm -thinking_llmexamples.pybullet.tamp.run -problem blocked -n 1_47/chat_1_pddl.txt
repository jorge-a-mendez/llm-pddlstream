           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning to Satisfy new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, the goal is to get `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` to be true. From the definition and the initial state, it looks like `?green` could be either `v8` or `v12`, both of which already have the correct type. So, really, I need to get either `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)` to be true.
           
           Let's focus on `v8` for now. To make `on(v8, v18)` true, I need to find a pose, let's call it `#o2`, where `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `atpose(v8, #o2)`.  Looking at the initial state, it says `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is already true. So the task is to get `v8` to that pose.
           
           Currently, `v8` is at `v9`. I can see from the initial state that I have `kin` facts, which will be useful.  I've got the actions available: `pick`, `place`, `move_base`, `clean`, and `cook`.  `clean` and `cook` are irrelevant. I need to move `v8` from `v9` to `#o2`. This looks like a pick and place operation.
           
           Okay, let's use the `pick` action first.  The preconditions are `kin`, `atpose`, `handempty`, `atbconf` and `unsafe` checks. I've got `atpose(v8, v9)` and I can see the appropriate `kin` relation for arm `v4`.  I need an available grasp, which I have as `#o1`, an available base config, `#o3`, and an arm trajectory, `#o4`. I'm going to assume that `atbconf(#o3)` is satisfied as I only have a `move_base` action that goes from and to `v3`, and if `#o3` isn't `v3`, I don't see any other options.  I'll just work with what I know, and ensure the facts are consistent.  So, I can `pick v8` from `v9` with arm `v4`, using grasp `#o1`, base config `#o3`, and arm trajectory `#o4`.
           
           After picking, I then need to `place v8` at the target pose. The preconditions are similar: `kin`, `atgrasp`, `atbconf`, and the `unsafe` checks. Since I picked v8, I will hold it and I have a kin relationship with the same arm configuration `v4`. So, I'll `place v8` at the target pose `#o2` onto `v18` using arm `v4`, the grasp `#o1`, the base configuration `#o3` and the arm trajectory `#o4`.
           
           So the plan is: `pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4` and then `place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`. It looks like all of the continuous parameters are valid according to the provided information. This looks sound. I will move ahead with these actions.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachability**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a goal: `on(?green, v18)`, where `?green` is an object of a certain type. My initial thought is to identify potential candidates for `?green` based on the given state, and it seems like either `v8` or `v12` would work. Both have the correct type.
           
           Now, let's break down how to get an object *on* something.  The `on` predicate depends on `supported` and `atpose`.  In both cases, for `v8` and `v12`, I see that they can be *supported* by `v18`.  That's a good sign. The challenge lies in positioning them with the `atpose` predicate. This likely means using some kind of manipulation like 'pick' and 'place' actions to make their pose correct relative to `v18`.
           
           Unfortunately, the available action instance is just `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This moves the robot, but it doesn't do anything about manipulating objects. It *does* update the robot's state slightly. It sets 'canmove' to false. It doesn't put anything on anything else.
           
           Since my goal *definitely* requires the `on` predicate, and achieving this requires `pick` and `place` actions, and I don't have those, the provided actions will not work.  The `clean` and `cook` actions are irrelevant. I can conclusively say that the goal is currently unreachable.
