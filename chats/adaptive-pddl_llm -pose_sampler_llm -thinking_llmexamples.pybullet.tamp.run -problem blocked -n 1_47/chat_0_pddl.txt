           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation for Object ID 10**
           
           My objective is to determine 50 stable placements for an object (ID 10) on a surface. This object has dimensions very close to a square: approximately 0.099 x 0.099. The surface in question is defined by the interval `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.
           
           A stable placement means the object is entirely within the surface's boundaries. Since the object is an AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box), its bounding box must also be contained within the surface's bounding box. The object can be rotated. When rotated by an angle *theta*, its effective dimensions change, though since the object is nearly square, the impact of the rotation on its total bounding box size will be less significant. For an AABB, considering the half-extents is more straightforward. The maximum extent of the bounding box corners are: 
           
           *   `hw = abs(dx_h * cos(theta)) + abs(dy_h * sin(theta))`
           *   `hh = abs(dx_h * sin(theta)) + abs(dy_h * cos(theta))`
           Where `dx_h = size_x / 2` and `dy_h = size_y / 2`, and `size_x` and `size_y` are the object's dimensions.
           
           The surface's dimensions are `surf_x_min = 4.2, surf_x_max = 4.8, surf_y_min = -0.6, surf_y_max = 0.0`. For a stable placement, the object's center `(x_obj, y_obj)` must satisfy these constraints:
           
           *   `surf_x_min + half_width_rotated <= x_obj <= surf_x_max - half_width_rotated`
           *   `surf_y_min + half_height_rotated <= y_obj <= surf_y_max - half_height_rotated`
           
           Because the object is nearly square, `hw` and `hh` remain largely the same regardless of the angle, but slightly larger with rotations of 45 degrees.
           
           To generate 50 placements, I'll use 10 distinct angles across the full 2 * pi range of orientations. To create the placement diversity, I plan to create a grid structure, with each angle yielding 5 separate positionings, including the center, and the four corners of a smaller bounding box within this range.
