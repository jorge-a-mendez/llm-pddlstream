User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Approach to Finding Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with generating 25 possible locations for a robot base, given a specific target point and a map of obstacles. My primary concern here is efficiency and reliability – I want to produce valid positions that work without excessive trial and error.
           
           First, I need to understand the playing field. I'm given the dimensions of the workspace and the locations of various fixed obstacles as Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs). I'll analyze these AABBs carefully. It's a constrained space, with a central divider at x=0, and a few other obstacles scattered around.
           
           My strategy is as follows: I need positions within a maximum range of 4 units from the target and within the space's x and y limits. To create this list of valid locations, I'll go through the following steps:
           
           1.  **Candidate Generation:** I'll begin by focusing on the target point, (-0.95, -0.95), which is in the bottom-left quadrant. Since I need diversity, I'll use a grid-based approach combined with concentric circles around the target.
           2.  **Room Limits:** I will ensure my x and y coordinate values are within -2.5 and 2.5 for both values.
           3.  **Collision Avoidance:** I will prevent robot base positions from being *inside* any of the fixed obstacles, using the given AABB definitions.
           4.  **Occlusion Handling:** I'll need to make sure the robot base has line of sight to the target. This is where things get tricky. I have a `is_occluded()` function that checks line-of-sight using the AABBs. It does this by checking if there are AABBs along the line segment between the robot base and the target point. This is crucial given the central divider.
           5.  **Priority Region:** Since my target (-0.95, -0.95) is to the left of the x=0 divider, the robot base is more likely to be on the left side, as well.
           6.  **Grid Search and Circle patterns:** Finally, the code generates points. These candidates are passed to the collision and occlusion filters. If not enough positions, it tries a coarser grid and circle patterns.
           
           I've made sure to prioritize points around the target and the x=0 divider to find 25 positions.
