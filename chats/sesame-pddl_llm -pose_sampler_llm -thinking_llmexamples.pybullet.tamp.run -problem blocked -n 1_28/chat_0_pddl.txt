(Thoughts: **Fulfilling the User's Placement Request**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5, side length 0.07) on a rectangular surface defined by the points (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0).  A stable placement means the object must be entirely contained within the surface's boundaries.
           
           Given that the object's square, rotation affects the object's effective bounding box differently.  To determine stability, I need to calculate the *effective extents* of the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) after rotation, which varies with the rotation angle (theta). For a square object of side s, the `effective_size = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.  Stability is assured if the rotated object, when positioned, lies entirely within the bounds of the surface.
           
           I've decided on a strategy to generate diverse placements:  I'll vary both the rotation angle (theta) and the object's center coordinates (x, y). To ensure I have 50 placements, I'll pick a variety of ten rotation angles spanning 0 to 2*pi (to consider distinct orientations of the object itself), which will also yield varying effective AABB sizes.  For each angle, I will then place the object at five distinct `x` coordinates and fix the `y` coordinate to the center of its valid range.
           
           First, I calculate the allowed ranges for the object's center based on the effective size at the given angle. Then, I generate a series of `x` coordinates evenly spaced within this range. Since there is only one `y` coordinate for each rotation, this will produce the desired 50 stable object placements (5 positions * 10 angles). This approach gives a diverse set of placements within the surface, considering different orientations.

(Thoughts: **A Refined Placement Strategy for Object ID 10 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I'm aiming for 50 stable placements of this almost-square object (ID 10, dimensions ~0.07025 x 0.07025) on the surface ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  I've got a fresh opportunity to improve my approach based on the failure I saw with object ID 5. Turns out, my previous AABB checks were a bit *too* tight. I need to be more conservative.
           
           With the previous object, I calculated the effective width/height of a rotated square, but I didn't account precisely for the corner-to-corner distance after rotation.  This time, I'm going to be *exact*.  My issue was that I calculated *x - effective_size / 2* and the object AABB overlapped a boundary.
           
           To be precise, the exact effective width/height after rotation is calculated as `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This I missed previously.
           
           I know the surface's bounds: x ranges from 4.2 to 4.8, and y from -0.6 to 0.0. I'll need to calculate the *valid* center positions (x, y) for the object, considering rotation. I'll stick with 10 equally spaced angles between 0 and 2*pi, calculating `effective_width` and `effective_height` for each. I know that since the object is almost square, there is some symmetry among the angles.
           
           To generate the 50 placements, I'll calculate the range of valid center x values (`min_x_center`, `max_x_center`) for each of those 10 angles. I'll generate the x positions evenly distributed between the min/max range.
           
           To summarize, for each angle:
           1.  Calculate `effective_width`, `effective_height` with the rotated formulas.
           2.  Calculate the valid center coordinates.
           3. Distribute the x positions along the x range.
           4. Set the y position at -0.3.
           
           This new method will generate 50 distinct placements while ensuring no object AABB will go beyond the boundaries. I have re-checked the calculations using object dimensions and angle values and these computations are correct.
