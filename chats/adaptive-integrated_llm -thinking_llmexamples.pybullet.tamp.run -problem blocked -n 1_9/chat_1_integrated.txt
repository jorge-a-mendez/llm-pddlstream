User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.339, -0.471), (-4.262, -0.394)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.301, -0.433, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.051, 0.999).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Path to Achieving `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My objective is clear: satisfy the conjunction `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.  I've identified that `?green` can be either `v8` or `v12` based on the given `type` facts. The more promising path seems to be with `v8`. The axiom for `on(?o, ?r)` dictates that I must find a pose `?p` for object `v8` such that `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and then achieve `atpose(v8, ?p)`.
           
           Luckily, the initial state provides the fact `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`, so I need to make `v8` be at pose `#o2`. The robot arm needs to pick `v8` from its current pose `v9` and place it at pose `#o2`. The only available base configuration `v3` means the robot will stay still while picking and placing.
           
           To pick `v8` using arm `v4`, I'll formulate the action `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`.  I carefully verified that this action meets all its preconditions: the robot's kinematics, current pose, hand empty, and relevant safety conditions (no `unsafe` atoms present). The effects will be to get `v8` in the arm (`atgrasp`), the robot can move (`canmove`), and to get rid of the original `v8` pose `v9`.
           
           Next, I need to put `v8` on `v18` with the action `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`. Again, the preconditions were confirmed. This action sets `v8` to pose `#o2`, and the arm to being empty. 
           
           Now, for a crucial part: finding a suitable value for `#o2`. It should guarantee `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and a *stable* placement within the surface bounds of `v18`. I've taken into account `v8`'s size (AABB), `v18`'s bounds, and found suitable coordinates: `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`.
           
           This plan results in a *cost of 2*, one for pick and one for place.
           
           To summarize, the sequence will be:
           1. `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           2. `place(v4, v8, (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0), #o1, v3, #o4)`
           
           This straightforward sequence should satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, given all the facts and assumptions of the initial state.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachable Goal with Restricted Actions**
           
           Okay, so the user's right. That previous plan was a bust. We're only allowed `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))` – basically, the robot moves from its current configuration to the *same* configuration. Not very useful.
           
           Let's break this down. The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having object `v8` *on* object `v18`, and `v8` having a certain `type` which we already know is true from the initial state. To get `v8` *on* `v18`, we need two things:  `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)`. Thankfully,  `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is already true in the initial state. So, the real challenge is getting `atpose(v8, #o2)` to be true.
           
           Currently, we have `atpose(v8, v9)` which is true.  The usual way to change an object's pose is with `pick` and `place` actions, right? But the only allowed action is `move_base`. This is a *major* problem.  `move_base` just moves the robot from one base configuration to another. It does nothing to manipulate objects. It only changes `atbconf` and removes `canmove` which doesn't get us closer to the goal.
           
           The key actions -  `pick` and `place` - are simply *not* available.  Therefore, there is no way for the robot to pick up `v8` and place it on `#o2`.
           
           Because we can't achieve `atpose(v8, #o2)`, we can't achieve `on(v8, v18)`. And, as a result, the overall goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable. The given actions are insufficient to satisfy the goal. This goal, with these actions, is simply unsolvable.
