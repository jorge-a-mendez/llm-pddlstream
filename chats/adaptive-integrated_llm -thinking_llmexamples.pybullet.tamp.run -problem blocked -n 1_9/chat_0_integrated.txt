User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.339, -0.471), (-4.262, -0.394)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.301, -0.433, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.051, 0.999).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom stackable(v8, v18)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom type(v12, v17)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom type(v8, v17)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom pose(v15, v16)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom stackable(v12, v18)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom stackable(v15, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v14)
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom graspable(v15)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Unachievable Goal: A Deep Dive**
           
           My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object, let's call it `?green`, that satisfies two conditions: it must be `on(?green, v18)` and have the `type(?green, v17)`.
           
           Looking at the initial state, I see two potential candidates for `?green`: `v8` and `v12`, both of which satisfy `type(?green, v17)`. Now, the crucial part is to ensure that either `v8` or `v12` ends up `on v18`.
           
           To make an object `on v18`, I need to use the `on` axiom, which means the object needs to be `supported` by a specific `pose` that's also `atpose`. Analyzing the initial state, both `v8` and `v12` are supported by `v18`. So, theoretically, either can be placed `on v18`.
           
           Here's where the problem arises: the only action I'm allowed to perform is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action simply moves the base, and has no impact on object placement. It can't pick up or place any object. My expert intuition screams that it's useless for this task.
           
           To make an object `on v18`, I need a `place` action, and probably a `pick` action too. With the set of initial state facts and the available actions, it's impossible to manipulate the objects and achieve the goal of having `v8` or `v12` `on v18`. Even by examining the initial facts more closely, I confirm this impossibility. Neither object is initially on the desired target.
           
           In short, given the extremely limited and irrelevant set of actions allowed, this goal is, for all intents and purposes, unachievable. This is a classic case where the "solution" simply doesn't exist within the allowed action space.
