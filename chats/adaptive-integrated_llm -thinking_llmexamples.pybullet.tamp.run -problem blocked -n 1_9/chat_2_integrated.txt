           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.339, -0.471), (-4.262, -0.394)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.301, -0.433, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.051, 0.999).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've devised to satisfy the goal of achieving `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially means getting a specific object, `v8`, on top of a particular surface, `v18`, with the right type.**
           
           First, I examined the initial state and the goal. I recognized that `v8` needs to be placed on `v18` such that the axiom `on(v8, v18)` is true.  The plan involves the following steps:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  I must first move the robot's base from its current configuration, `v3`, to a suitable configuration, `#o3`. This will be done with `move_base(v3, #o3, #o0)`. The `atbconf(#o3)` precondition necessitates the move. The continuous value of #o3 is to be determined by the base planner as it is not a pose for an object.
           
           2.  **Pick Up Object:** Then, I use the robot arm `v4` to pick up the object `v8` from its current pose `v9` using the command `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`. The `kin` information indicates this is possible and all preconditions are met.
           
           3.  **Place Object:** Finally, I'll place the object `v8` onto the surface `v18` at a new pose which I'm calling `#o2`. I achieve this with the `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` action.
           
           **The Continuous Parameter:**
           
           The key to this plan's success is defining the precise pose for `#o2`.  I've reasoned that the best position is centered on `v18` along its x-axis, at the tabletop height of `0.8`. The object's AABB is considered to make sure it rests in the y bounds of v18. I have calculated `#o2` as a pose on the surface: `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`.
           
           **Important Considerations:**
           
           I've ensured that the object's placement is "stable," meaning it's fully contained within the surface, and that I'm taking the initial `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` in the initial state into account.
           
           To summarize, with this plan, `v8` ends up correctly placed in accordance with the goal. I am assuming the planners can handle the "unsafe" or collision checks within the actions.
