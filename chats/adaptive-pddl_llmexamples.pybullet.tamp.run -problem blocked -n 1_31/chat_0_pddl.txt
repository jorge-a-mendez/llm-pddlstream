           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom pose(v15, v16)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)

           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v15`. `v8` is currently at `v9` and is supported by `v11`. `v12` is at `v13` and supported by `v14`. `v15` is at `v16` and supported by `v11`. The goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which, according to the axioms, means `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. In the initial state, `v8` and `v12` are of type `v17`. `v18` is a surface where `v8` and `v12` can be stacked. The initial state also specifies `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`, indicating that both `v8` and `v12` can be placed on `v18` at pose `#o2`. Since the axiom uses `?green` as a variable, either `v8` or `v12` could fulfill the `on(?green, v18)` condition if they are moved to `v18`.
           
           However, the only action available in the `valid_action_instances` is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. This action just moves the base from `v3` to `v3`, which does not change the state of any object or achieve the goal. There are no `pick` or `place` actions available, which would be necessary to move `v8` or `v12` onto `v18`. Therefore, the goal is unreachable with the given allowed actions.
