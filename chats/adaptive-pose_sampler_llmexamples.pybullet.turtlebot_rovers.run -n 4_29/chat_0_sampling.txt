User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with walls at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5. There's a vertical obstacle in the middle at x=0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered around. Many of the small obstacles are in the upper left and upper right quadrants, and there's a cluster in the lower right. I need to find positions within 2 units of the target point. I will try to stay away from the walls and known obstacles as much as possible, prioritizing open spaces. I will also try to vary the angle around the target point for diversity.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     My previous positions were too far from the target point and likely blocked by the central obstacle at x=0. The target point is at (-2.00, 2.14), which is in the upper left quadrant. I will try to find positions closer to the target, keeping in mind the wall at x=-2.5 and y=2.5, as well as several small obstacles in this quadrant. Specifically, I'll avoid boxes 8, 10, 14, 19, and 20 which are in this area.

Model:     The target point has changed to (1.86, 1.80), which is in the upper right quadrant. My previous attempts were completely off for the new target. The previous failures show that the position (-1.01, 1.64) collided with obstacle 14. This means I need to be more careful about the small obstacles.
           
           For the new target, I should focus on positions within 2 units from (1.86, 1.80). This region is near the obstacles 7, 9, 11, 12, 17, 21, and 22. I will try to stay clear of these. I will also make sure to not cross the central obstacle at x=0.
