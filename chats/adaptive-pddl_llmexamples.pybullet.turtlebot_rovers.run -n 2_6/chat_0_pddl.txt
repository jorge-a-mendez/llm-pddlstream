           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, each with a camera `v10` and a store `v16`. There are several rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`) of different types (`v2`, `v6`). There are also two objectives `v17` and `v18`, and a lander `v9`. Both rovers are at specific configurations (`v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14`) and have empty stores. The camera `v10` is onboard both rovers, which is likely an error in the initial state or indicates `v10` is a generic camera type that can be used by both rovers. However, the `onboard` predicate for `v10` and `v14` will be crucial. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires both rovers to be at their respective configurations (`v13`, `v15`), have free stores (`v16`), have received images for objectives `v17` and `v18` with mode `v11`, and have received analysis for rocks of type `v2` and `v6`.
           
           Based on the available actions, the rovers can only `move` to their current positions, or `drop_rock` if their store is full. Since the stores are currently free, `drop_rock` is not immediately useful. The `new-axiom@0()` goal is a complex one, requiring several sub-goals to be met:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: True in initial state.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: True in initial state.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: True in initial state.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: True in initial state.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: Needs to be achieved.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Needs to be achieved.
           7. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means any rock of type `v2` needs to be analyzed and sent. Rocks `v1`, `v3`, `v4` are of type `v2`.
           8. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means any rock of type `v6` needs to be analyzed and sent. Rocks `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are of type `v6`.
           
           The provided action instances only allow `move` to the current position and `drop_rock`. There are no `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` actions available in the list of valid action instances. This means that if these actions are necessary to achieve the goal, the goal is unreachable with the given valid actions.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` explicitly requires `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (for rocks of type `v2`), and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (for rocks of type `v6`). To achieve these, the rover would need to:
           - Calibrate its camera.
           - Take images of objectives `v17` and `v18`.
           - Send those images to the lander.
           - Sample rocks of type `v2` and `v6`.
           - Send the analysis of those rocks to the lander.
           
           None of these actions (calibrate, take_image, send_image, sample_rock, send_analysis) are present in the list of valid action instances. Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the provided list of allowed actions.
           
           No plan is possible.
