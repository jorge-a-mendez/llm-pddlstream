User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.633, -0.577), (-4.551, -0.496)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.592, -0.537, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.768, 0.641).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Alright, here's my plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, breaking down my thought process.**
           
           The objective is to get an object of type `v17` *on* object `v18`. I have some choices: `v8` and `v12` both fit the bill since they're both of type `v17` and stackable on `v18`. Let's focus on `v8` first.  The idea is to get `v8` from its current location (`v9`) onto `v18`.
           
           To do this, I'll need two actions: a `pick` to get `v8` into the robot arm and a `place` to put it onto `v18`. The `supported` predicate tells me exactly *where* on `v18` it needs to go: at pose `#o2`.
           
           **First, the `pick` action.**  I've got the arm (`v4`), the object (`v8`), a grasp (`#o1`), and the necessary "kinematic" information (`kin`) to reach `v8` at pose `v9`. My preconditions include making sure the arm is empty, the robot is in a valid base configuration and no safety violations exist. I also need to ensure that the robot is at `atbconf(v3)`.
           
           Here's where it gets a little tricky: the `kin` predicates use `#o3`, a continuous parameter for the base configuration. But, I only have a `move_base` action that goes from `v3` to `v3`. It looks like `#o3` *must* be the same as `v3`. Otherwise, there's no way to reach the configuration required by the `kin` predicates, and the `pick` action would fail. I must make this implicit assumption.
           
           Assuming that `#o3` is `v3` for simplicity and based on the problem design. With `kin` it becomes possible to reach `v8` from `v3` with the arm's trajectory trajectory `#o4`, which the system has prepared for use.
           
           **Now, the `place` action.** I'll use the same approach: ensuring the correct base configuration and no safety concerns. I also assume that I can place `v8` safely on the continuous location `#o2`. I need to make sure the pose `4.5 -0.3 0.8 0.0` is correct.
           
           After the `pick` and `place`, I'll achieve the `new-axiom@0()` goal: the object is on the other object.
           
           Finally, I'll need to define the pose of the continuous parameter `#o2` on `v18`. Given the AABB of `v18`, placing it at the centre `4.5 -0.3 0.8 0.0` will work.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, here's the situation. The user gave me a goal: `on(?green, v18)`. Basically, they want something that's the same *type* as *green* to be placed on top of `v18`. From the initial state, I can see that `v8` is the same type as what's represented by *green*. So, the *green* in the goal represents `v8`.
           
           To make `v8` on `v18`, it needs to be *supported* by `#o2`. We know `v8` is *supported* by `#o2`, but it's not actually *atpose* `#o2`.  Currently, it's at a different pose, `v9`.
           
           My initial thought was to use `pick` and `place` to get `v8` from `v9` to `#o2`.  But then I checked the list of *valid action instances*, and there's only one available: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  No `pick` or `place`!
           
           Since I can't move anything, I'm stuck. I checked to see if another object of the same type as `v8` might already be on `v18`. I found `v12`, which *could* be on `v18` but is not.
           
           Given the constraints (no `pick` or `place` available), the goal cannot be achieved. The initial state doesn't satisfy the goal, and I'm unable to change it. So, I will explain why the goal is unachievable and not return a plan.
