(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable locations for an object (ID 5) on surface 0.  The surface's dimensions are defined as ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)), and the object's AABB dimensions are 0.07 x 0.07.  A "stable" placement means the object's AABB must be fully inside the surface's AABB.  A placement is represented as (surface index, rotation angle, x-coordinate, y-coordinate).
           
           I'm interpreting the problem statement carefully.  It states that the object's dimensions are defined by its AABB (0.07 x 0.07). The "theta" parameter represents the rotation of an *internal representation* of the object, *not* a rotation of the object's bounding box that will be placed.  For simplicity, the provided `size_x` and `size_y` values correspond to the dimensions of the unrotated AABB.  This allows us to treat the placement of the AABB as independent of `theta` and to ensure that the bounding box placed on the surface is always 0.07 x 0.07.
           
           The stability conditions are straightforward: the object's x-center must be within the surface's x-range, and the object's y-center must be within the surface's y-range, after accounting for half the object's AABB width and height.
           
           The x-coordinate should be in the range [4.235, 4.765] and the y-coordinate should be in the range [-0.565, -0.035]. The rotation angle, theta, can be any value, but to give variety, I'll generate the following `theta` values: 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3*pi/4, pi, 5*pi/4, 3*pi/2, and 7*pi/4.  Since I'm aiming for 50 placements, I'll create a grid of x and y values within the valid ranges and cycle the different thetas to produce a diverse distribution of stable positions.  Since the valid ranges for `x` and `y` are 0.53, and 0.07 is the AABB dimension, I will use `7 + 1 = 8` equal steps for `x` and `y`. This means that if 7 objects fit in the valid area, 8 steps are possible. This is a common pattern for grid creation.  I'll start with y coordinates, and then, after the y's, go into the x's.  
           
           I will now generate and print the list of 50 placements in the format required by the problem statement:
           
           ```

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's break this down.**  I've got a new placement request for object ID 10 on surface 0, and I need to find 50 stable, collision-free positions. Object 10 has dimensions `0.098 x 0.098`, and surface 0 is defined by the points `(4.2, -0.6)` and `(4.8, 0.0)`.
           
           First, I need to figure out the valid placement range on the surface, ensuring the object doesn't fall off. This gives me a rectangular area:  X goes from roughly 4.249 to 4.751, and Y goes from -0.551 to -0.049.
           
           Then, I've got to consider object 5, which is already placed at `(4.235, -0.565)`. It's dimensions are `0.07 x 0.07`, creating an AABB of `[4.2, 4.27] x [-0.6, -0.53]`.  I need to avoid collisions with this existing object.
           
           To do this, I'm going to create an 8x8 grid of candidate center points within the valid surface range. For each candidate point, I'll calculate the bounding box (AABB) of object 10. Then, I'll check for any overlap between object 10's AABB and object 5's AABB.
           
           If there's no overlap, I add that placement to my list. I'm also going to iterate through a set of angles (0 to 5.5, in steps of ~0.78), to find multiple stable positions.
           
           The main idea is to perform a systematic search, checking for collisions, and ensuring I get the required number of placements. I'll test each candidate (x, y) with all angles available, or until I have the needed 50 valid placements.
