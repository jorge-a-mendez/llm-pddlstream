           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Goal and Available Actions**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to have objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` on `v18`. From my expert perspective, this translates to manipulating these objects using `pick` and `place` actions to change their supporting object. I start by checking the initial state, which confirms that the four objects are currently supported by `v11`.
           
           The crucial part here is examining the available actions. The problem statement explicitly restricts me to the provided action instances. Looking at the action instances, I only see `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This is problematic. `pick` and `place` are necessary for this kind of manipulation, and those actions need `kin` predicates, which are given. However, because only `move_base` is available, and there are no instances of `pick` and `place`, I realize that I cannot change the `on` predicates of any object.
           
           Even though I have the `kin` facts and valid poses, the allowed actions are simply insufficient to achieve the goal. No available instance permits picking or placing, which are essential for changing an object's support.
           
           As a conclusion, given the limited allowed actions, the goal is unachievable, and there is no possible action plan.
