           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a small object (ID 10) on a rectangular surface (AABB).  The surface's dimensions are relatively large compared to the object, so I expect a wide range of possible placements. A valid placement requires that the entire rotated object's AABB lies within the surface's AABB.
           
           Since the object's dimensions (size_x and size_y) are very close, I can treat it as practically square. This simplifies the calculations. I'll need to account for rotation (theta). The half-extents of the object's rotated bounding box will vary slightly with theta. I'll focus on a few key angles: 0, pi/4, pi/2, and their intermediate values.
           
           First, I calculate the rotated half-extents using standard trigonometry with absolute values for cosine and sine to account for rotations beyond pi/2. I denote the object's half-extents as hx and hy. I determine the valid ranges for the object's center (x, y) based on the surface's AABB and the rotated half-extents.  This becomes:
           x_min_surf <= x - rotated_hx
           x + rotated_hx <= x_max_surf
           y_min_surf <= y - rotated_hy
           y + rotated_hy <= y_max_surf
           
           The available x- and y-center ranges depend on the value of rotated_hx and rotated_hy.
           
           To ensure sufficient distribution and avoid potential clustering, I then generate a grid of x and y coordinates within these valid ranges. I aim for approximately 10 placements per each selected angle, 5 values for x, and 2 for y, for a total of 50. I ensure valid coordinates for each generated position within the 0 and pi/2 space. I have also added in error handling within the script to account for tiny ranges for placements to prevent errors in coordinate generation, though it will not likely occur.
           
           The final output will be a list of 50 tuples, each containing the surface index (0), rotation angle (theta), and the (x, y) center coordinates for each placement, exactly as requested.
           ```
           ```python
           placements = [
           (0, 0, 4.2490756048324205, -0.5509243951675788),
