           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Path to Achieving `new-axiom@0()` in the `pr2-tamp` Domain**
           
           My goal is to figure out a plan to make `new-axiom@0()` true.  After looking at what `new-axiom@0()` means, I know it boils down to: get an object of a particular type `?green` to be *on* another specific object, `v18`. From the initial conditions, it seems `v8` is a likely candidate for this `?green` object.  The trick is to get `v8` onto `v18`.
           
           Analyzing the `on` predicate, I need to place `v8` onto a pose where it is `supported` by `v18`.  Luckily, from the initial state, I see that this is already a potential situation.
           
           Now, for the plan! Since the robot's arm `v4` and base are initially ready, I can pick `v8` and put it where it needs to be.  Here's what I came up with:
           
           1.  **Move the robot base:** I'll use `move_base` to get the base into a good spot. This action requires the base to be in a certain `atbconf` state, which it currently is. Once the base is in the right configuration, I can proceed.
           
           2.  **Pick up the block:**  I'll use the `pick` action to grab `v8` with arm `v4`.  The preconditions are met: `atpose`, `handempty` and the correct kinemtatic information.
           
           3.  **Place the block:** I'll then `place` `v8` onto `v18` at the appropriate pose, which is supported by the `supported` predicate I analyzed previously. This move requires the block to be held, and I've ensured this using `pick`.
           
           I've carefully checked the preconditions for each action, and it seems that everything lines up perfectly. By executing these three actions in sequence – move the base, pick up the object, and place it – I should be able to make `new-axiom@0()` true!  I confirmed that the `canmove()` predicate is properly handled across steps. All actions are allowed. The plan is valid and the goal should be achieved.
