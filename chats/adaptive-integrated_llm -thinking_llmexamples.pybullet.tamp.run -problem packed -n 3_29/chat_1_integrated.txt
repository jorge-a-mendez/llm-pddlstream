User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.01, -0.368, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.804, 0.595).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.246, 0.005, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.22, 0.975).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.093, -0.492), (0.171, -0.413)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.293, -0.042), (-0.2, 0.052)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.033, -0.412), (0.054, -0.325)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.132, -0.452, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.998, -0.062).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Atom kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Inability to Formulate a Plan Given Constraints**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a planning problem. My objective is straightforward: to get objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto surface `v16`.  The initial state indicates all three objects are currently supported by `v11`, and the robot is at base configuration `v3` with an empty hand.  My goal is clear: `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  This necessitates a `pick` and `place` strategy to satisfy the `on` predicates, given my understanding of the relationship between `on`, `supported`, and `atpose`.
           
           However, the problem throws a major wrench in the works.  I see I'm given a restricted set of *allowed* action instances.  There's only one action available: `move_base v3 v3 #o0`.  This essentially means the robot base can move from its current position `v3` to the same position `v3` via a trajectory `#o0`.  While I see evidence of the necessary preconditions for `pick` and `place` actions, in the form of `kin` predicates for the robot's arm and the objects at specific poses, these actions are explicitly *not* in the permitted list.
           
           This is a critical constraint.  The planning setup explicitly states that any action not included in the list of allowed actions cannot be used. Since `pick` and `place` actions are not available, there is no way for me to manipulate the objects and achieve the goal state. The sole action available (`move_base`) is entirely irrelevant to changing the location of the objects.
           
           Therefore, given the constraints of the allowed actions list, the specified goal is unattainable. I will need to explain this reasoning clearly.
