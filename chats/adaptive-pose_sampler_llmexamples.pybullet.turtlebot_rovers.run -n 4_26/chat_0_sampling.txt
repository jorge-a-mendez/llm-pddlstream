User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene contains a central open area, with obstacles near the boundaries and some smaller obstacles scattered within. The large rectangular obstacles are mostly along the perimeter, with one running vertically through the center. Specifically:
           - A large square boundary from (-2.5, -2.5) to (2.5, 2.5).
           - Thin rectangular obstacles forming the outer walls.
           - A central vertical obstacle at x=0, from y=-2.5 to y=2.5.
           - Several smaller square obstacles in the corners and along the x-axis, especially around y=1.75 to y=2.25.
           - Other small, scattered rectangular obstacles.
           
           Given the target point (1.209689814421683, -0.6277054655294028), I need to find 25 valid base positions within a max range of 4. I will prioritize positions that are away from the known obstacles and that offer good line-of-sight to the target. I will try to spread out the positions to explore different viewing angles and avoid local traps.
           
           Since the target is in the first quadrant, but with a negative y-component, I will explore positions mostly in the first and fourth quadrants, as well as parts of the second and third, staying clear of the central vertical obstacle (x=0) and the other scattered obstacles. I will try to keep positions within the x and y limits of -2.5 and 2.5.
