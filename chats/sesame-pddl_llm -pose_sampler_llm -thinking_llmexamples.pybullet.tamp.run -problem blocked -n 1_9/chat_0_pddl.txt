(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements**
           
           My primary goal is to determine 50 stable placements for a square object on a given rectangular surface. The object's dimensions are 0.07 x 0.07. The surface is defined by its AABB: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  A stable placement requires that the object's AABB be entirely contained within the surface's AABB.
           
           To achieve this, I need to consider the object's position (x, y) and its rotation (theta).  Since the object is a square, the effective AABB dimensions don't change drastically with rotation, so I'll prioritize rotations of 0 and pi/2 for simplicity initially. I will add some pi/4 rotations (45 degrees) later.  I'll start by defining the valid ranges for the object's center coordinates (x, y) given the surface's boundaries. I'll then generate a grid of placements across that surface, ensuring I'm within the bounds of the AABB constraints.  For x, I found the valid range to be [4.235, 4.765] and for y, [-0.565, -0.035].
           
           My plan is to create a 9x5 grid of placements (45 total) with theta = 0, distributed evenly across the valid x and y ranges. I calculated the appropriate steps for x and y to ensure even spacing. Then I will add 5 rotations of pi/4 (45 degrees) to test out the diagonal rotations.
           
           I'll calculate the center coordinates for the objects at rotation angles of 0 and pi/4, accounting for the change in AABB dimensions due to rotation. The goal is a good distribution of placements on the surface with varying rotations to demonstrate the placement capabilities. This should produce stable placements.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Object Placement Constraints**
           
           Okay, here's what I've got to consider. I'm tasked with placing a new object, `ID: 10`, onto a surface while avoiding collisions with a previously placed object, `ID: 5`. The key is that `ID: 5`'s successful placements are now essentially fixed obstacles.
           
           First, I need to understand the constraints imposed by these `ID: 5` objects. I have a list of their placements, and their AABB's. The dimensions for object `ID: 5` are `0.07 x 0.07`. By reviewing the placements, I've determined these objects create a "wall" of sorts along the left edge of the surface, with x coordinates blocked between approximately `4.2` and `4.33625`, and a full y-range blocked. Object ID:10 has dimensions `0.0908 x 0.0908`.
           
           The surface I'm working with is defined by the coordinates `(4.2, -0.6)` to `(4.8, 0.0)`.
           
           My initial thought is to figure out the valid placement area for the new object without considering the obstacles. After that, I will work with the obstacles.
           
           For `theta = 0` (no rotation), the minimum valid x position of object ID:10 is `4.2 + half the object side` which is calculated. In this case, `4.2454`. And the maximum valid x position is `4.8 - half the object side` , which is `4.7546`. The range for y is the similar calculation of surface values plus or minus the object’s half sizes.
           
           Now, I introduce the collision avoidance with `ID: 5`. Since `ID: 5` effectively blocks a section of the surface by y, the only feasible solution to avoid collision is to place `ID: 10` *completely* to the right of the `ID: 5` block. This means the object ID:10 minimum x value has to be greater or equal to block’s maximum x value. After calculation it is found that minimum object ID:10 x placement has to be `4.38165`.
           
           Considering the collision avoidance, the placement area is significantly limited: `4.38165 <= x <= 4.7546` and `-0.5546 <= y <= -0.0454`.
           
           For a rotated object (ex: `pi/4`), the valid area gets smaller. However, considering the available placement space, I've decided to prioritize placements with `theta = 0` (no rotation) to maximize the useable space.
           
           To create the required 50 distinct placements, I'm generating a grid of coordinates within this defined area. I'll take a number of steps in the x and y dimensions of the object’s size, to distribute the placements throughout the available area. The resulting calculation is valid.
