User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.265, 0.239), (-0.171, 0.333)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.17, 0.248), (0.255, 0.334)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.025, -0.406), (0.112, -0.32)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.023, 0.42), (0.072, 0.515)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.218, 0.286, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.971, -0.24).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.212, 0.291, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.992, -0.129).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.068, -0.363, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.798, 0.602).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.025, 0.468, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.858, 0.514).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains several objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) that need to be moved to be on object v18. The current location of these objects is on object v11. There are also several possible poses for these objects on v18, all referred to as #o2. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, both are initially empty. The robot is currently at base configuration v3 and both arms are at their initial configurations (v5 and v7). There are no `pick` or `place` actions available for objects to be moved to v18. The only available action is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, which doesn't change the robot's base configuration or affect the objects in the scene. Therefore, the goal is not achievable from the initial state with the given available actions.
