           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point is (0.91680608 0.49000287). I will try to find 3 positions within a radius of 2 from this point, avoiding the known obstacles. The obstacles are mostly on the borders of the allowed area, and some smaller ones are scattered in the center. I will try to pick points that are somewhat spread out around the target.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     The target point is (-1.8766423463821411, 2.2100818157196045). My previous attempts failed due to line-of-sight issues and a collision with obstacle 9 ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)). The target is in the upper-left quadrant. Obstacles 8, 9, and 10 are in the upper-left quadrant and need to be avoided. Obstacle 20 is also very close to the target. Given the target's location, I should aim for positions that are to its left, below it, or slightly to its right, while staying within the allowed range and avoiding known obstacles. I will try to stay relatively close to the target, as the `max_range` is 2. The previous proposals were too far from the target.

Model:     The target point is (-1.8766423463821411, 2.2100818157196045). My previous attempts failed again. The first two positions were too far from the target and possibly occluded by obstacle 5, or other obstacles, as they were on the right side of the x-axis, while the target is on the left. The third position collided with an obstacle. The previous set of proposed points also failed. The previous attempts were:
           
           *   (1.5, 0.7) - no line of sight
           *   (0.5, 0.5) - no line of sight
           *   (0.9, 2.0) - collides with obstacle 9 ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))
           
           And then:
           
           *   (-2.2, 0.5) - no line of sight
           *   (-0.5, 0.5) - no line of sight
           *   (-2.2, 1.5) - no line of sight
           
           The target is at (-1.87, 2.21). Obstacle 20 is at ((-1.91, 2.17), (-1.84, 2.24)), very close to the target. Obstacles 8, 9, 10 are also in the upper part. It seems like the area around the target is quite cluttered. I need to find positions that are within a distance of 2 from the target. The failures suggest that staying on the right side of the x-axis (x > 0) is problematic, likely due to obstacle 5 ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)). I will try to stay on the left side of the x-axis, and slightly below or to the left of the target, considering the close proximity of obstacle 20.

Model:     The target point is (2.0367560386657715, 2.143791913986206). My previous attempts failed. The target is in the upper-right quadrant. The previously failed positions were primarily on the left side of the x-axis, which is far from the current target and likely caused line-of-sight issues due to obstacle 5. One position even collided with obstacle 10 ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)), which is far from the current target. I need to focus on positions in the upper-right quadrant, close to the target, avoiding known obstacles like 7 ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) and 19 ((1.98, 2.09), (2.08, 2.19)), which are very close to the target.
