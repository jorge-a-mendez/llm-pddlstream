           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Achieving the Goal**
           
           The ultimate goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires that we achieve the state where an object, `v12`, is located *on* the surface `v18` and that `v12` is of type `v17`. We know from the initial state that `v12` is indeed of type `v17`, so the primary sub-goal becomes placing `v12` *on* `v18`. From the initial conditions and domain axioms, we know an object `v12` is *on* another surface, `v18`, if: `supported(v12, P, v18)` and `atpose(v12, P)`, where P is some pose. Further inspecting the problem instance, we see that an object `v12` is supported at pose `#o2` on table `v18`. So, we must place object `v12` at the particular pose `#o2` so that it is supported by the table.
           
           To achieve that, we will employ a standard `pick` and `place` sequence. Currently, `v12` is located at initial pose `v13`. We must move our robot's base to allow the robot arm to reach the initial pose. To move the robot's base we will need a `move_base` action. Then, the arm will `pick` the object from its initial pose. Then, the arm will `place` the object onto its final destination. In more detail, our plan will proceed as follows:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  First, the robot base, which is initially at `v3`, needs to move to base configuration `#o3`. Then the arm can then reach the initial pose, `v13` and the destination pose, `#o2`. The PDDL facts give that we have: `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)` and `atbconf(v3)` in the initial state, along with `canmove()` and a list of available actions in the domain.
           2.  **Pick:** Then, use the robot arm `v4` to `pick` object `v12` from its initial pose `v13`. The `pick` action's preconditions must be satisfied. Namely: the arm must have access, be ready, and that the object is in a supported pose on its table, and that the appropriate trajectories are available.
           3.  **Place:** Next, use robot arm `v4` to `place` object `v12` at the target pose `#o2`. This assumes that the robot's base remains at the position `#o3`. The `place` action's preconditions must also be satisfied. Namely: the base has to have sufficient configuration to be able to place the object and that there are a set of available trajectories. The robot will move to achieve both this `place` and the original `pick` actions from base `#o3`.
           
           Based on the preconditions of the domain, the `kin` facts, and the available actions, this plan is feasible.
           
           We're explicitly instructed *not* to calculate values for the non-pose continuous parameters. Therefore, the only continuous parameter that requires a value is the target pose for the object on the surface. We provide the following placement, to make the plan executable. We choose to make the object's bottom to be at z = 0.8 in the scene for proper support, thus `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)` for `#o2`. Note that because this is `pose(v12, #o2)`, we *must* specify a value for `#o2`.

(Thoughts: **Addressing a Potential Parsing Issue**
           
           Okay, so the user seems to think my previous plan had an invalid action. They flagged a parenthesis, but that's part of the syntax! I'm pretty sure their parser just got confused. I'm going to resubmit the exact same plan, but before I do, let me quickly double-check everything.
           
           The goal is to get `v12` "on" `v18`. That means ensuring `v12` is supported by `v18` and that `v12` is in the correct pose.  The initial state says `v12` starts at location `v13`, and we're given the fact `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. We're going to use this fact to our advantage! We also know the robot base is at location `v3` and the robot's gripper is empty.
           
           Here's the plan I'll submit:
           
           1.  **Move the Base:** First, I'll move the base from its initial location `v3` to a configuration, `#o3`. The required preconditions, like base motion and base availability, are all met, which means the base is moving around as we need. The only cost is the distance from `v3` to `#o3`.
           2.  **Pick Up the Object:**  Next, I'll pick up `v12` from its starting pose at `v13`. All preconditions are there; the robot arm is kinematically able to get to `v13` (through facts about `kin`), and the gripper is empty.
           3.  **Place the Object:** Finally, I'll place `v12` at location `#o2`. Again, the necessary kinematic information is there, the gripper is holding the object, and we are not in an unsafe environment.
           
           Every action looks good. The initial state and all preconditions support the current plan. The goal is met because placing `v12` at `#o2` satisfies the `atpose` part of our "on" requirement.  Since `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` is in the initial state, we're good to go.
           
           The provided pose for `#o2` seems valid based on the surface's bounding box and a reasonable object placement height. The base configs appear sound given the possible movements from initial state to goal state.
           
           I'm confident the original plan is correct. It looks like the issue was just a parsing glitch on the user's side, so I will resubmit the plan as is. Hopefully, it'll work this time!
