           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.548, 0.065), (-4.452, 0.161)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.5, 0.113, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.962, -0.272).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.196, 0.513)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning to Satisfy new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object, `v12`, of a certain type, "on" another object, `v18`. Since we know `v12` is of type `v17` from the start, we just need to get `v12` *onto* `v18`. From the initial state and the definition of "on," this means finding a pose, `#p1`, such that `v12` is supported at that pose by `v18` *and* `v12` *is* at `#p1`. I already know `supported(v12, #p1, v18)` is true. So my focus is on how to get `v12` to that crucial pose.
           
           Currently, `v12` is at `v13`. I've got to use a pick-and-place strategy. I'll need the robot `v4` to *pick* `v12` up from its current location (`v13`) and then *place* it at the target pose, `#p1`.  This requires a pick *and* a place action.
           
           Looking at the available `pick` actions, there's one that perfectly fits the bill: `(pick v4 v12 v13 #g1 #q2 #t5)`.  This one picks `v12` from its current location (`v13`). Key preconditions are: the robot's arm has to be empty, I need the kinmatics for this task, the base has to be in the right config. And it can't be an unsafe trajectory or approach for the task. So, I have to first ensure the robot base is at the config `#q2` before I can actually `pick` `v12`. I am given `basemotion` in the initial state so I can safely assume that the base can move.
           
           To get the base to the right position, I'll need to execute `(move_base v3 #q2 #t6)`. Its preconditions are all satisfied in the initial state.
           
           After this base movement, I can `pick v12` from its current position. This is the critical step to bring my desired outcome to fruition. After picking, the base must move again.
           
           So, I need to also place the base for the place action which is another `move_base`.
           
           Then, I've got to execute a `place` action: `(place v4 v12 #p1 #g1 #q3 #t7)`.
           
           And the preconditions are met! Now that this is complete, I'm confident that the sequence:  `move_base -> pick -> move_base -> place` will get `v12` where it needs to be â€“ fulfilling the goal.
           
           Now, there's the issue of the continuous value for `#p1`. Let's pick a pose within the AABB bounding box and keep in mind that I have to choose a location on `v18` for `v12`, but no collision should happen. The value for the z dimension should be adjusted because I have an existing z value from `v12` pose. Using `v14` surface for comparison, I can define `v12` z value which is similar to what `v13` implies. I will take into account the height of `v12`. Thus I calculate the value.
           
           Taking into account the object and surface sizes, and making sure that the surface `z` is suitable for the `v12` placement, I determine the `x,y,z` for `#p1`: x=4.5, y=-0.3, and z=0.8.
           
           So there it is. The plan is sound.
