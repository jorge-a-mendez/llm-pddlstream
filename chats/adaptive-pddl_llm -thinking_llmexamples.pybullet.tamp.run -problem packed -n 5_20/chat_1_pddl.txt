           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Okay, let's break down this planning problem.** My goal is to get five objects: v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18, all onto a surface called v20.  Currently, they're each at different poses on v11.  The core idea here is, to be "on" something (like v20), an object needs to be both supported and in the correct pose. The predicates "supported" and "atpose" are what I must satisfy.
           
           Since I am at a high level, I quickly see that for each object, I'll need to use the `pick` and `place` actions.  The *current* state provides me with all the necessary facts regarding each object: They are graspable, their current poses (`atpose`), the poses they can be on v20 (#o2), and the required kinematic information (`kin`). This shows which *base configurations* can be used to perform which `pick` and `place` action.
           
           The system is setup with the base configuration named v3, and the initial state has the predicate `atbconf(v3)` that tells me that *that* is the current base configuration. The `move_base` action available in the state has no effect on the base configuration in my scenario.
           
           I need to pick each object from its current pose on v11 and *place* it at a new pose, #o2, on v20.  I have kinematic information to do that. The goal is `on(?o, v20)`. I can make `on(?o, v20)` true by ensuring the object is supported on v20 AND it is in the target pose (atpose).
           
           The system gives me a sequence of 'pick' and 'place'. I must consider *all* the preconditions:  That the object is graspable, that the arm is handempty, that the kinematics allow the pick, that the *base configuration* is suitable, and that the pose is available (not unsafe).  My initial state *says* I am at `v3`, which *might* be compatible with `#o3`.
           
           I *must* verify that the configuration from the `kin` action is available.
           
           I'm thinking that since this is a TAMP problem with continuous parameters, I'll assume that the base configuration v3 is valid for all pick/place operations since I have a 'kin' fact for each one. The fact that `kin` uses `#o3` implies that the base is in a suitable state, even though `atbconf(#o3)` is not explicitly stated.
           
           Given the existing constraints and assumptions, I will formulate the following plan:
           
           1.  Pick v8, place v8.
           2.  Pick v12, place v12.
           3.  Pick v14, place v14.
           4.  Pick v16, place v16.
           5.  Pick v18, place v18.
           
           This will get the goal done.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v18 v19 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v18 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of Achieving the Goal**
           
           Okay, I see the problem. The user is right, my initial approach won't work. I have to stick with the single action instance provided: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This severely limits my options.
           
           I've re-examined the problem. The goal is clear: get those objects, v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18, *on* v20.  Looking at the initial state, those objects are currently *on* v11. Fine.
           
           Now, the crucial part: what does `move_base` actually *do*? I analyzed its effects. It moves the base and updates `canmove()`, nothing else. Critically, it does *not* affect the `atpose` or `supported` predicates, nor does it establish *on* relationships between objects.  It does not create any new `on()` relationships and I can't think of how to manipulate objects with it.
           
           So, here's the bottom line:  given *only* `move_base`, there is absolutely *no way* to move those objects from their current position on v11 to the desired position on v20. The goal is unreachable with this limited action set. It's a fundamental conflict. The planning problem is unsolvable with the action instance that's been given.
