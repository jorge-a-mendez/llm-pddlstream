           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.165, 0.487), (-0.067, 0.585)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.173, 0.186), (0.248, 0.261)).

           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.206, -0.506), (-0.126, -0.426)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.129, -0.328), (-0.055, -0.253)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.116, 0.536, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.908, -0.418).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (0.211, 0.224, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.732, 0.681).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.06, 0.422, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.972, -0.237).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.166, -0.466, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.763, 0.646).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.092, -0.29, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, -0.03).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's how I'm thinking about this planning problem:**
           
           I need to get these five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) onto a specific surface (v20). They're all currently on v11. The core of this is about moving things, so I'm looking at the `on` predicate and how it relates to `supported` and `atpose`.  Essentially, I need to get each object at a new pose on v20 where the supporting relationships are already established.
           
           Looking at the initial state and the axioms, the key is to move each object to a pose on v20. The `supported` facts give me potential placement locations (`#o2`). Since there are several objects, I'll need to make sure their final placements on v20 are distinct, although it appears all poses can be identified with the generic `#o2`.
           
           The robot has two arms, v4 and v6. Both are currently handempty. The robot base is static at v3. The problem provides all kinematic information through the kin predicate which greatly simplifies the planning task.
           
           The only movement action I'm allowed is moving the base, which is a no-op since it keeps the base at `v3`. It doesn't really seem necessary since the initial kin facts specify v3. The important part is picking and placing things using the available `kin` information that references the arm v4. I'll need to use those for picking and placing each object.
           
           To move each object, the plan is to:
           
           1.  **Pick** the object from its current location on v11 using the available `kin` fact for arm v4, ensuring that v4 is handempty and base configuration is at v3.
           2.  **Place** the object at a new, specified location (`#o2`) on v20 using the kin fact.
           
           Since there's only one arm available (v4) for picking up all objects, I'll have to repeat this sequence for each object, picking and placing one at a time. This seems pretty straightforward and should be a solid plan. I need to make sure that none of the objects will collide when I place them on v20.
           
           The key to collision avoidance will be in properly choosing the new pose for `#o2` for each object. The `z` value for the pose, based on the initial state, should be 0.781 (which appears to be the height relative to the supporting surface). I'll have to consider bounding boxes. The new locations need to be within the bounds of v20 and also far enough apart from each other.
           
           To avoid overlap, the goal is to have the objects aligned within the bounds of `v20`. The objects are small enough that if each is positioned roughly in a grid formation on the surface, they should not overlap.
           
           Here's how I will proceed: First, pick the object from the v11 pose. Then, place the object at the designated, non-overlapping location on v20. Since all objects can be moved sequentially using v4 with the parameters from `kin` facts, the procedure should work fine. I will have to ensure that the intermediate poses for all 5 objects and their orientations will not generate any collisions. There is an `(move_base)` action that doesn't seem to have any effect in this situation, so it can be omitted. I have analyzed the action carefully to ensure there is no hidden effect of missing a step in the movement. There is also an implicit assumption about collision avoidance in the kine facts, and I will assume those are valid. I will assume the provided `kin` facts and my chosen `pose` values are valid.
           
           Now, I'll just write down the actual actions and make sure I cover each object:
           
           1.  Pick v8, place v8.
           2.  Pick v12, place v12.
           3.  Pick v14, place v14.
           4.  Pick v16, place v16.
           5.  Pick v18, place v18.
           
           This should be it, as there are no other constraints or complications to the problem. I'm pretty sure this will work. All the preconditions should be met, and the goal will be achieved.

           Okay, so I completely missed the crucial constraint here. The user's feedback highlighting the limited action set is a wake-up call. I was so focused on the goal state that I didn't fully internalize the implications of the *only* valid action instance being `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This isn't just a restricted action, it's essentially a no-op! A move that doesn't move.
           
           Let me break this down. The problem statement defines the goal as getting five objects to be `on(?, v20)`.  Initially, each object is `on(?, v11)`. The `on` predicate is derived from both `supported` and `atpose`, as I already know. To shift an object from being on `v11` to `v20`, I need to manipulate the `atpose` and `supported` facts.
           
           But then I look at the available action. The `move_base` action, *the only option* is completely useless for achieving this. It *only* affects the `atbconf` and `canmove` predicates. It has *absolutely no effect* on the `atpose` or `supported` predicates! This means I have no way to manipulate the physical arrangement of the objects, which is what the problem demands. I am, in effect, trapped.
           
           Given this severe limitation, the goal is *unreachable*. It's a fundamental conflict between the initial state, the goal state, and the permissible actions. There's no way to bridge the gap.
