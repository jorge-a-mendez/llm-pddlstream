           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning for the Plan**
           
           My objective is to achieve the goal of placing an object of type `v17` on `v18`. After analyzing the axioms and the initial state, I've determined that this translates to finding a suitable object and then manipulating it such that it is `supported` by and at a specific `pose` on `v18`.
           
           Two objects of type `v17` are present initially: `v8` and `v12`. Examining their initial states, I found that both are supported by and at poses relative to other objects. However, since I'm trying to place them on `v18`, I need to determine which is closer to its target surface (i.e. easiest to move).
           
           I then determined that placing `v8` on `v18` would be simpler, because it is located closer to the base.
           
           Given that choice, the plan involves three steps:
           
           1.  A `move_base` action to reposition the robot's base to a suitable location.
           2.  A `pick` action to grasp and lift the object.
           3.  A `place` action to set `v8` onto the surface.
           
           To create this plan, I first needed to ensure all preconditions are met for these actions. For the first step, I confirmed the robot can `move_base`. For the second and third steps, I confirmed that `v8` is in its starting position, that it is hand-empty (robot arm ready), and that the robot base is at an appropriate configuration. Additionally, I considered that `unsafeapproach` and `unsafepose` must be false.
           
           I then chose the placement of the base to be x=4.0, y=0.0, to facilitate easy gripping and placing by the arm. I also chose the placing pose, #o2, to be (4.5, -0.3, 0.8), where the x, y coordinates are near the center of the surface `v18`. I ensured that the pose did not fall outside `v18` boundaries.
           
           As a final check, I verified the chosen `bconf` and `pose` would not violate any collision conditions and are a stable placement location. After reviewing the actions I selected to use, I determined the final plan to be valid.
           
           --Poses--:
           
           #o2: 4.5 -0.3 0.8 0.0
