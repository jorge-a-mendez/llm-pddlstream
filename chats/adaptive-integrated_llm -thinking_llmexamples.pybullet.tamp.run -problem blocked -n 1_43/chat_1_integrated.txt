           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:

           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.563, -0.419, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.17, 0.985).

           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.608, -0.464), (-4.518, -0.375)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's my plan:**
           
           My goal is to achieve the new axiom `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially means I need to put object `?green` of type `v17` onto surface `v18`.  I've identified that `v8` (which is of type `v17`) fits the bill, so I'll aim to put `v8` on `v18`.  
           
           Looking at the world, I see that I can achieve this if I can make the predicates `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)` true.  Currently, `v8` is at pose `v9`, so I need to pick it up and place it on surface `v18`.
           
           My plan is simple: First, I'll pick up `v8` from its current pose `v9`. I'll use arm `v4` to do this with the action `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`. All the preconditions for this pick action are satisfied, which means there should be no collision conflicts. Then I will  `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` It looks like the right pose is `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)` for `#o2` for a collision free, stable placement. Because  `v8` has a small footprint, placing its origin at this location on `v18` will place its AABB entirely within `v18`. After a moment, `v8` should be on `v18`!  And since, `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is in the initial state,  `on(v8, v18)` and `type(v8, v17)` are true, and I will achieve the goal.
           
           The cost for `pick` and `place` is 2. The other `move_base` action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` is available, but the plan works without it, given the assumptions.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment: Goal Unreachable with Current Actions**
           
           Okay, the user's right. That previous plan was a dead end. The issue is clear: I've been given a very limited action set, and it's simply not capable of achieving the desired goal.
           
           Let's retrace the reasoning. The objective is `on(?green, v18)`, which, translated, is essentially placing a green object on surface `v18`. From the initial state, I know there are two potential green objects: `v8` and `v12`. To satisfy the goal, I need to get one of them onto `v18`.
           
           My understanding of the world tells me that to get something *on* something else, I need two things: the object to be *at* a specific pose, and for that pose to be *supported* by the surface. Luckily, I already know that both `v8` and `v12` are supported by `v18` *at* pose `#o2`. So, the problem boils down to getting either `v8` or `v12` to `#o2`.
           
           Here's the rub. The *only* allowed action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. It's a non-starter. This action doesn't manipulate objects. It just shifts the robot's base without affecting object poses, nor any properties like "cleaned" or "cooked." It's essentially a no-op, moving the robot from `v3` to `v3`.
           
           The core problem is the *missing* actions. To achieve the *on* predicate, I need actions like `pick` and `place`, essential for moving and manipulating objects. I don't have them! Without those actions, or something equivalent, there's absolutely no way to alter the state of the world to fulfill the goal.
           
           Therefore, given the constraints of the available actions, the objective of `on(?green, v18)` is definitively *unachievable*. It's a dead end, a paradox of the action space. I need different tools for this particular job.
