           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.563, -0.419, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.17, 0.985).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.608, -0.464), (-4.518, -0.375)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom graspable(v12)

           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Goal Achievability**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which expands to `on(?green, v18) ∧ type(?green, v17)`. The initial state gives me `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`. This means `?green` could be either `v8` or `v12`. Let's explore both cases.
           
           If `?green` is `v8`, I need to achieve `on(v8, v18)` and I already have `type(v8, v17)`. To satisfy `on(v8, v18)`, I need a pose `p` such that `supported(v8, p, v18) ∧ atpose(v8, p)`.  I can see `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` in the initial state, so I need `atpose(v8, #o2)`. However, `v8` is currently at `v9` according to the initial state (`atpose(v8, v9)`). This means I need to "pick" `v8` up from `v9` and "place" it at `#o2`.
           
           The problem is the *available action instances* only include `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. This does nothing to change the positions of objects. It simply changes the robot's base configuration. The given set of action instances strictly limits us to *only* this action. This implies no `pick` or `place` operations, which are absolutely crucial for getting an object to a specific location.
           
           I've hit a roadblock. Since only a movement for the robot base is available, and there are no instances of `pick` or `place`, I cannot physically move `v8`. Therefore, `on(v8, v18)` is unachievable, making the overall goal impossible in this scenario.
           
           Now, if I consider `?green` to be `v12`, the analysis is the same but with different objects and poses.  The situation is equivalent: I need to get `v12` onto `v18`. Since I can't move objects, and can only move the robot's base, I'm stuck again.  This goal is unachievable. The constraint that non-provided actions are forbidden solidifies that.
           
           My conclusion is that `new-axiom@0()` *cannot be achieved* given the available actions. I need `pick` and `place` actions to manipulate the objects and the set of available actions does not include these, rendering the goal unreachable. The robot cannot perform the manipulation needed to stack an object onto `v18`.
