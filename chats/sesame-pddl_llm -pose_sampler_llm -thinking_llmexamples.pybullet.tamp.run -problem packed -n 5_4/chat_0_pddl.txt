(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My objective is to determine 50 stable placements for an object (ID 4) on a given surface (surface 0). The object is almost square, with dimensions approximately 0.0792 x 0.0792, and the surface is a square of size 0.27 x 0.27, centered at (0, 0).
           
           A placement is considered stable if the object is fully within the surface bounds and does not collide with any other obstacles. Since this is the first object being placed, I only need to ensure the object remains within the surface's boundaries.
           
           The strategy is to create a grid of (x, y) coordinates within the safe bounds of the surface, and then choose different orientations (theta) for the object at these locations. Since the object is nearly square, its bounding box size does not change considerably upon rotation.
           
           First, I calculate the safe region for the object. The maximum half-width and half-height of the object's rotated bounding box are approximately 0.0560. Thus, the valid ranges are approximately x: [-0.0789, 0.0789] and y: [-0.0789, 0.0789]. I'll use a slightly more conservative region to ensure safe placements.
           
           I'll define a grid with `x` and `y` values in [-0.07, 0.07]:
           `x_coords = [-0.07, -0.046, -0.023, 0.0, 0.023, 0.046, 0.07]`
           `y_coords = [-0.07, -0.046, -0.023, 0.0, 0.023, 0.046, 0.07]`
           
           There are 49 such `(x, y)` coordinate combinations.
           
           For these, the placement will be `theta = 0`. So, the solution placements are the Cartesian product of the `x` and `y` coordinates.
           
           To complete the 50 placements, I'll add the following one: (0, pi/4, 0, 0).
           
           The placements will be given as a list of tuples in the format: `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`.

(Thoughts: **Placing Object 5: A Detailed Plan**
           
           Okay, so I've got the go-ahead on placement for Object 4 (ID 4), which looks like `(ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, -0.07, -0.07`.  Now, the challenge is to place Object 5 (ID 5). We're dealing with the same surface, `0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  Importantly, Object 5 has dimensions `size_x = 0.07937115651568677` and `size_y = 0.0793711565156868`, almost square, much like Object 4, at `size_x_4 = 0.07921973015538553`, and `size_y_4 = 0.07921973015538541`. The immediate goal is to find 50 stable placements for Object 5 on Surface 0, but crucially, avoiding any collisions with Object 4.
           
           Object 4 is placed at `(surf_idx=0, theta=0.0, x=-0.07, y=-0.07)`.  Its AABB, centered at `(-0.07, -0.07)`, has half-extents of `half_sx_4 = 0.039609865077692765` and `half_sy_4 = 0.039609865077692705`. Therefore, it occupies the region: `x_range_4 = [-0.10960986507769276, -0.030390134922307235]` and `y_range_4 = [-0.1096098650776927, -0.030390134922307295]`.
           
           For Object 5, we have `half_sx_5 = 0.039685578257843385` and `half_sy_5 = 0.0396855782578434`. The bounds on the surface are `x_min = -0.135`, `x_max = 0.135`, `y_min = -0.135`, `y_max = 0.135`. With the possibility of rotation, the maximum effective half-dimension of Object 5 is approximately 0.05612347596.  This means the center of object 5 must be within the following ranges: `x` from approximately `[-0.07887652404, 0.07887652404]` and `y` from approximately `[-0.07887652404, 0.07887652404]` to ensure it stays within the surface bounds regardless of rotation.
           
           To avoid collision, I need to ensure that Object 5's AABB (at any rotation) does not overlap with Object 4's AABB. Given Object 4's fixed position and dimensions and our near-square shapes, a simple approach is best. I will primarily consider placements for Object 5 with `theta=0`.  This keeps the calculations straightforward.
           
           With `theta = 0`, I need to find center point, (x, y), so that I can calculate an AABB which does not overlap the fixed AABB for object 4. In other words, I need to position `(x, y)` so that `x_range_5 = [x - half_sx_5, x + half_sx_5]` does not overlap `x_range_4`, OR `y_range_5 = [y - half_sy_5, y + half_sy_5]` does not overlap `y_range_4`.
           
           Given Object 4's location, I can place Object 5 either on the opposite side of the center (0,0), or the top/bottom (where y > 0 or y < 0) to guarantee a wide berth.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Summary (ID 6)**
           
           Alright, here's the breakdown of my thinking on placing object ID 6, a nearly square object, within the defined constraints. The key goal is to find 50 safe placements on surface 0, avoiding collisions with objects 4 and 5, which are already in place. I'm making the simplifying assumption of a zero rotation angle (theta = 0) for object 6, allowing for conservative and straightforward collision checks.
           
           My approach involved analyzing the surface bounds and using the concept of axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) to determine areas where potential collisions could occur. I considered the bounds of the surface and the established positions and sizes of objects 4 and 5. I calculated safe regions within the surface that would guarantee that object 6 would not collide.
           
           First, I established the maximum x and y bounds for the object center. Then, I determined the AABBs for object 6, and I constructed a collision avoidance procedure. To keep things simpler, I used a collision check, and for each point, I computed whether object 6 would collide with a previous object's AABB. I selected and generated a series of x,y coordinates and checked for potential collisions.
           
           Through these calculations, I found that there were several suitable regions:
           -   Any x/y coordinate for object 6's placement where x > 0.0867 and y > -0.013 are non-colliding. I could also use a separate computation to derive a safe placement region.
           -   I derived that the x coordinates were valid from -0.09 to +0.09 and the y coordinates were valid between -0.09 and +0.09.
           Using this information, I identified a set of 50 non-colliding placements for object 6 and assembled them into a list. This analysis ensures a diverse and optimal placement scenario.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 7**
           
           My primary goal is to find 50 stable locations for Object 7 (a square, ID: 7) on Surface 0, ensuring that it doesn't collide with previously placed objects (IDs: 4, 5, and 6) and remains entirely within the boundaries of Surface 0. Surface 0's dimensions are defined as `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. Object 7 is a square with a known size and half-extents calculated for convenient collision checks.
           
           To achieve this, I must perform these checks:
           
           1.  **Surface Containment:** The center of Object 7 must be positioned so that it's fully within the defined Surface 0 bounds. Because this object is a square and using `theta=0`, this simplifies to ensuring that both the `x` and `y` coordinates of the object's center fall within a specific range, approximately `[-0.09, 0.09]`. I'll tighten it to `[-0.08, 0.08]` to be extra cautious.
           
           2.  **Collision Avoidance:** Crucially, Object 7 must not intersect with any of the existing objects (4, 5, and 6). To manage this, I'll leverage the axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) of all objects. This strategy greatly simplifies the collision checks.  I've already calculated the AABB for each object. For Object 7, I compute the AABB from the calculated half-extents. Then, to determine non-collision, I'll check that:
           
               *   The maximum `x` of Object 7 is less than the minimum `x` of any existing object.
               *   The minimum `x` of Object 7 is greater than the maximum `x` of any existing object.
               *   The maximum `y` of Object 7 is less than the minimum `y` of any existing object.
               *   The minimum `y` of Object 7 is greater than the maximum `y` of any existing object.
           
               If *any* of those conditions hold true for *all* existing objects, Object 7 will not be colliding.
           
           Based on the existing objects' positions and sizes, I will generate placements for the new object. I will test each proposed coordinate using the function `is_colliding()`. If a location does not collide with existing objects, I will keep that proposed placement. I will iterate until I've found 50 valid locations, all of which I'll report as `(theta, x, y)` positions.

Model:     **Finding Stable Placements for Object 7**
           
           My primary goal is to find 50 stable locations for Object 7 (a square, ID: 7) on Surface 0, ensuring that it doesn't collide with previously placed objects (IDs: 4, 5, and 6) and remains entirely within the boundaries of Surface 0. Surface 0's dimensions are defined as `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. Object 7 is a square with a known size and half-extents calculated for convenient collision checks.
           
           To achieve this, I must perform these checks:
           
           1.  **Surface Containment:** The center of Object 7 must be positioned so that it's fully within the defined Surface 0 bounds. Because this object is a square and using `theta=0`, this simplifies to ensuring that both the `x` and `y` coordinates of the object's center fall within a specific range, approximately `[-0.09, 0.09]`. I'll tighten it to `[-0.08, 0.08]` to be extra cautious.
           
           2.  **Collision Avoidance:** Crucially, Object 7 must not intersect with any of the existing objects (4, 5, and 6). To manage this, I'll leverage the axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) of all objects. This strategy greatly simplifies the collision checks.  I've already calculated the AABB for each object. For Object 7, I compute the AABB from the calculated half-extents. Then, to determine non-collision, I'll check that:
           
               *   The maximum `x` of Object 7 is less than the minimum `x` of any existing object.
               *   The minimum `x` of Object 7 is greater than the maximum `x` of any existing object.
               *   The maximum `y` of Object 7 is less than the minimum `y` of any existing object.
               *   The minimum `y` of Object 7 is greater than the maximum `y` of any existing object.
           
               If *any* of those conditions hold true for *all* existing objects, Object 7 will not be colliding.
           
           Based on the existing objects' positions and sizes, I will generate placements for the new object. I will test each proposed coordinate using the function `is_colliding()`. If a location does not collide with existing objects, I will keep that proposed placement. I will iterate until I've found 50 valid locations, all of which I'll report as `(theta, x, y)` positions.
