           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, two cameras, v10 (onboard both rovers), and several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and objectives (v17, v18, v19). There is also a lander v9. The rovers are at specific configurations (v13 for v12, v15 for v14) and have the store v16 free.
           
           The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom that describes a state where:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are true (both rovers are at their initial configurations).
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true (both rovers have free storage).
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)` are true (images of all three objectives have been received using mode v11).
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` are true (a stone has been analyzed and the analysis received).
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` are true (soil has been analyzed and the analysis received).
           
           Looking at the initial state:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are already true.
           - `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are already true.
           - The `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates are all false.
           - There are rocks of type v2 (v1, v3, v4) which are "stone" and rocks of type v6 (v5, v7, v8) which are "soil".
           
           The available actions are very limited: `move` and `drop_rock`.
           - `move` actions for v12 and v14 would move them to their current configurations, which doesn't change anything relevant to the goal.
           - `drop_rock` actions for v12 and v14 would only be applicable if they were `full(v, s)`, but they are `free(v, s)`. So these actions are not currently useful.
           
           None of the actions in the provided list can achieve `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`. Actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` are *not* available in the provided list of valid action instances, even though their preconditions are partially met in the initial state for some rovers and objects. Since the goal requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` to be true, and there are no actions provided that can achieve these predicates, the goal is not achievable.
