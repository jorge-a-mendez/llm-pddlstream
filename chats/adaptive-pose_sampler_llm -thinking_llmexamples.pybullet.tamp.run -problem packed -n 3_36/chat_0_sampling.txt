(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object ID 4**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 4, a square object with extents of (0.07727532412801552, 0.07727532412801552), meaning it's a square.  This object needs to be placed on surface `0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`, which is also a square, centered at (0,0).  Stability here means the object's bounding box must be completely contained within the surface's bounding box.
           
           Since the object's a square, its bounding box remains the same regardless of rotation.  So, I need to focus on ensuring the object's center point lies within a valid region on the surface.
           
           First, I need to establish the valid ranges for the object's center coordinates (x, y).  The object's half-width and half-height are both 0.03863766206400776. Therefore, the minimum valid x is -0.135 + 0.03863766206400776 = -0.09636233793599224 and the maximum valid x is 0.135 - 0.03863766206400776 = 0.09636233793599224. The y values also range from -0.09636233793599224 to 0.09636233793599224.
           
           Next, I'll generate the placement points. To get 50 different locations, I have a few options. I'll define x coordinates from -0.09636233793599224 to 0.09636233793599224 using np.linspace for evenly spaced values, and I will then generate y coordinates in the same range, then define the number of points with these ranges. To generate these x and y points, I will use np.linspace. I need x_coords and y_coords to be evenly spaced. The number of points and distances depend on the surface. These are 7 and 8 points, for (x, y) combinations, respectively. The angles are selected from 0, pi/6, pi/3, pi/2, 2pi/3, 5pi/6, pi, 7pi/6, 4pi/3, 3pi/2, 5pi/3, 11pi/6. To get all of the points I need, I will iterate through the y_coords then x_coords, assigning an angle to each x and y combination.
           
           I have decided to create a grid structure by combining these coordinates with a rotating angle that will be applied to each pair. This is done to achieve 50 placements with diverse x, y, and theta.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Avoiding Collisions**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback and need to place a new object, ID 5, on a surface. Object 4 is already positioned, and I've successfully calculated its AABB. Now, I need to find stable placements for Object 5 on Surface 0, ensuring it doesn't collide with Object 4.
           
           First, I defined the valid placement ranges for Object 5 based on the surface's boundaries. I calculated the object's dimensions and the permissible x and y ranges to keep it within the surface area. I also considered object 4's AABB for the surface bounds.
           
           Next, I addressed the collision avoidance. I defined the forbidden regions for Object 5's center, those areas where a collision with Object 4 would occur.  Using the dimensions and positions, I calculated that `obj5_x_collision_upper_bound_center` and `obj5_y_collision_upper_bound_center` are both equal to `-0.01841365957043283`.
           
           To find valid placements, I set up a grid of points within the surface bounds. I checked for collisions by comparing the object's position to the defined collision threshold of `-0.01841365957043283`. I am only able to place objects either to the right or above Object 4. In essence, I created an 'L' shaped placement strategy.
           
           The points were divided into valid and invalid placements based on the collision condition. I set the loop to populate the area from the bottom left to the top right.  Once I had the list of 50 placements, I included rotation about the z-axis (12 rotations), and returned those.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for this new object, ID 6, on surface 0.  I've got to make sure it doesn't collide with objects 4 and 5, which are already in place.  First things first, I calculate the valid placement range on surface 0, taking the object's dimensions into account. It's essentially a square, with dimensions very close in both x and y.
           
           Next, I define the AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) for the existing obstacles, which helps to streamline collision detection.  I'm using the object's center coordinates and sizes to define their bounds.  I've got the necessary AABB calculations for both object 4 and object 5, and then derive the collision region in surface coordinates.
           
           Now, the core of the problem: checking for collisions. I've got a function set up to determine if the object's center falls within the collision zone for either object 4 or object 5. The basic condition is simple: the distance between object centers must be less than the sum of their half-widths and half-heights.
           
           Since the collision regions are overlapping, I need to combine them and derive the no-collision ranges for both x and y. I carefully calculate the overlapping area and, considering the surface bounds, I can filter out the placement which causes any collision. I set up a grid, iterate through possible placements, and apply a rotation to cover possible orientations.  Then, by looping through all the possible center locations, and filtering for placements that do not collide with either obstacle, I can generate a list of safe placements.
