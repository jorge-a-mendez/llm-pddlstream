           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks us to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom representing a complex set of conditions including having images of `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` received at the lander, having `v2` and `v6` type rocks analyzed, and having both `v12` and `v14` rovers with free storage `v16`.
           
           Let's break down the conditions of `new-axiom@0()`:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is true initially.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is true initially.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: This is true initially.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: This is true initially.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This requires `v12` or `v14` to take an image of `v17` in mode `v11` and then send it to the lander.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This requires `v12` or `v14` to take an image of `v18` in mode `v11` and then send it to the lander.
           7. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This requires `v12` or `v14` to take an image of `v19` in mode `v11` and then send it to the lander.
           8. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means we need to analyze a rock of type `v2` and send the analysis. `v1`, `v3`, `v4` are type `v2` rocks.
           9. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means we need to analyze a rock of type `v6` and send the analysis. `v7`, `v8`, `v5` are type `v6` rocks.
           
           We have two rovers, `v12` and `v14`. Both rovers have camera `v10` onboard, which supports mode `v11`. Both have `v16` as a free store.
           
           Let's consider the actions to achieve these subgoals:
           
           For `receivedimage`:
           - `calibrate`: Requires `imagevisible`, `onboard`, `atconf`, `~blocked`.
           - `take_image`: Requires `imagevisible`, `onboard`, `supports`, `atconf`, `calibrated`, `~blocked`.
           - `send_image`: Requires `comvisible`, `objective`, `mode`, `haveimage`, `atconf`, `~blocked`.
           
           For `receivedanalysis`:
           - `sample_rock`: Requires `above`, `store`, `atconf`, `free`.
           - `send_analysis`: Requires `comvisible`, `rock`, `analyzed`, `atconf`, `~blocked`.
           
           We have the following initial conditions that are relevant:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`
           - `free(v12, v16)`
           - `free(v14, v16)`
           - `onboard(v10, v12)` and `onboard(v10, v14)`
           - `supports(v10, v11)`
           - `objective(v17)`, `objective(v18)`, `objective(v19)`
           - `rock(v1)`, `rock(v3)`, `rock(v4)` (type `v2`)
           - `rock(v5)`, `rock(v7)`, `rock(v8)` (type `v6`)
           - `lander(v9)`
           
           Crucially, the only available action instances are `move` and `drop_rock`. This means we cannot calibrate, take images, send images, sample rocks, or send analysis. The problem statement says: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           Since the goal `new-axiom@0()` requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates to be true, and the necessary actions to achieve these (e.g., `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`, `calibrate`) are not in the list of allowed action instances, the goal is not achievable.
           
           The problem specifically asks to return a plan *only if* the goal is achievable. If not, I should explain why.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the given set of allowed action instances.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires several `receivedimage` predicates and `receivedanalysis` predicates to be true. To achieve `receivedimage`, actions like `take_image` and `send_image` are needed. To achieve `receivedanalysis`, actions like `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` are needed. However, none of these actions are present in the provided list of allowed action instances. The only allowed actions are `move` and `drop_rock`, which cannot produce `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` facts. Therefore, the goal is not achievable from the initial state with the given constraints.
