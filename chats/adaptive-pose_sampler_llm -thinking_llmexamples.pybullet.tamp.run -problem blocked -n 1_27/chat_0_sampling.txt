(Thoughts: **Initial Thoughts and Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, dimensions 0.07 x 0.07) on a rectangular surface defined by the coordinates ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  A "stable" placement means the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) is entirely within the surface's AABB.  A placement is defined by (surface_index, theta, x, y), where theta is the rotation angle and (x, y) is the AABB's center.
           
           The key is interpreting what "geometry of the object...described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)" actually means. Does that refer to a fixed size regardless of rotation or the object itself?  Given "stable" and "geometric reasoning," I'm assuming that it means that when rotated, the *object* will grow its AABB. Therefore, the AABB dimensions will change.
           When the object is rotated by `theta`, the new effective dimensions of the AABB for the object are:
           `rotated_sx = abs(obj_sx * cos(theta)) + abs(obj_sy * sin(theta))`
           `rotated_sy = abs(obj_sx * sin(theta)) + abs(obj_sy * cos(theta))`
           We are safe with these calculations if we think that the given dimensions, are not the fixed size of the AABB.
           
           The object is a square of 0.07 x 0.07.
           
           The surface is 0.6 wide and 0.6 high.
           When rotated, the object will have an AABB that's a *little* bit bigger.
           `rotated_sx = abs(0.07 * cos(theta)) + abs(0.07 * sin(theta))`
           `rotated_sy = abs(0.07 * sin(theta)) + abs(0.07 * cos(theta))`
           Since it is a square, it means `rotated_sx == rotated_sy`. Let's denote the new side length to `R_dim = 0.07 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.
           So, when `theta = 0`, it is just `R_dim = 0.07 * (1 + 0) = 0.07`.
           And when `theta = pi/4` (45 degrees), then `R_dim = 0.07 * (1 + sqrt(2)/2) = 0.07 * sqrt(2) = 0.09898...`
           
           Therefore, for this placement, the object's AABB is always smaller than the size of surface 0.
           So, the surface is much bigger than the objects.
           
           The object, being a square, has AABB dimensions 0.07 x 0.07.
           
           For `theta = 0`: the half-dimension is 0.035.  The valid `x` range is [4.235, 4.765] and valid `y` range is [-0.565, -0.035].
           
           For `theta = pi/4`: the half dimension will be 0.07*sqrt(2) / 2 = 0.049497...  The x range: [4.249497..., 4.750502...] and y range is [-0.550502..., -0.049497...].
           
           I'll generate placements with a 5x5 grid for theta = 0, and another one with the same grid size for theta = pi/4. I just need to avoid overlaps.
           
           So I'll pick:
           *   **Theta = 0:** I will create a 5x5 grid by dividing the ranges of x and y in 4 equal parts.
           *   **Theta = pi/4:** I will create a 5x5 grid with the same strategy.
           
           I'm confident these 50 placements will be valid. No overlaps with previous placements because it is the first request. The object is a square, which makes things easier. And the surface is really big compared to the object.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements, Avoiding Collisions**
           
           Alright, I've got a new task: place object ID 10, a small square-ish object, 50 times on surface 0, and *avoid* those pesky collisions with object ID 5.  Remembering that success with the previous configuration means this approach should work well.
           
           Object 5 is placed pretty much in the lower-left corner of the surface, so I'll need to be mindful of that.  Object 10 is almost a perfect square, so I'll take the simplification and take a single value for `obj_s`.
           
           My strategy is to generate placements for object 10 at two orientations: `0` (flat) and `pi/4` (rotated). For each orientation, I'll calculate the valid placement area on surface 0, considering object 5’s position.  Then I will generate those grid coordinates, making sure to avoid collisions.
           
           The AABB of object 5, which I already checked for, is from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.27, -0.5).  I'll compare object 10 placements with this area for each point, adding the non-colliding coordinates to my list. I’ll make sure to get the AABB values correct for each rotation (half widths and heights).
           
           For the final list, if the placements are less than 50 total I will just pick points in different orientations that are separated enough from the other existing ones.
           
           So, I’ll:
           
           1.  Calculate the rotated AABB dimensions for `theta=0` and `theta=pi/4`.
           2.  Calculate the valid placement ranges on surface 0 for each theta.
           3.  Generate 5x5 grids of candidate placements, checking for collision. The 0 angle coordinates are generated first, followed by the pi/4.
           4.  If the number is not enough, add 2 additional placements on the midpoints of valid ranges, each at a different theta.
           
           With all numbers precise, I should get 50 stable and collision-free placements.
