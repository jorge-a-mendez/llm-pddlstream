           Object v21 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.006, 0.41), (0.104, 0.508)).

           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.198, -0.477), (-0.108, -0.387)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.063, -0.443), (0.162, -0.344)).

           Object v19 is a pose with position (0.055, 0.459, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.899, 0.437).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.109, -0.242, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.438, 0.899).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.153, -0.432, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.179, 0.984).

           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.016, -0.487, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.186, 0.982).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've devised:**
           
           My primary goal is to move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) from their initial positions on surface v11 to a target location on surface v20. The target location for each object is defined by the pose symbol `#o2`, and the plan is to achieve this using a series of pick and place actions with the robot's arms. The robot has two arms (v4 and v6), but I'm focusing on v4.
           
           First, I need to analyze the initial and target conditions:
           
           *   **Initial State:** Objects are at specific poses (v9, v13, v15, v17, v19) on surface v11, with the robot's base at configuration v3 and arm v4 at configuration v5. All arms are empty. I'm assuming the given kin (kinematic) relationships and the existing predicates are correct and represent valid configurations.
           *   **Target State:** I want to get each object `on` (supported and at the pose) v20 at the pose `#o2`. Since the `supported` relation and `v20` already hold, the plan needs to reach the `atpose` goal.
           
           I need to use pick and place actions. The sequence will be straightforward: pick each object, move it, and place it. To handle each movement effectively, I'll address all the elements. The plan will contain a `move_base` action since the initial base is at v3, and the action `pick` and `place` require base config `#o3`.
           
           *   `move_base`: I'm moving the robot base from v3 to a configuration `#o3` (0.0, 0.0, 0.0), facing towards the target surface, to improve reachability. The robot will move to a good starting base position relative to v11 and v20.
           *   `pick`: I'll use the available kinematic relations to pick up each object from its current location with arm v4.
           *   `place`: Next, I'll place each object at its respective target pose on surface v20.
           
           The constraints are:
           
           *   All object poses on v20 must be at `#o2` pose, which is specified in the problem. I'll need to generate a new coordinate for each of the five objects in the `#o2` place action, relative to the AABB of v20. I will ensure no overlap. Surface v20 is 0.27 x 0.27 units, and I have five small objects, roughly 0.1 x 0.1 units each, to place on it. I determined the optimal pose relative to the target's center and ensured that all generated values are inside `v20`.
           *   The `kin` predicates provide the necessary parameters for the pick and place actions.
           *   I will verify collision avoidance for the poses I generate, assuming the provided trajectories and grasps are safe based on the initial state.
           
           Here's the detailed plan I've developed:
           
           1.  **Move Base:** `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)` to position the robot's base at `(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. This places it for good reach to objects.
           2.  **Pick and Place Sequence:**
               *   Pick v8 from v9 and place it at `#o2_v8 (0.0 0.0 0.781 -0.9079)`.
               *   Pick v12 from v13 and place it at `#o2_v12 (0.08 0.0 0.781 -0.9079)`.
               *   Pick v14 from v15 and place it at `#o2_v14 (-0.08 0.0 0.781 -0.9079)`.
               *   Pick v16 from v17 and place it at `#o2_v16 (0.0 0.08 0.781 -0.9079)`.
               *   Pick v18 from v19 and place it at `#o2_v18 (0.0 -0.08 0.781 -0.9079)`.
           
           I've ensured that the generated poses for `#o2` are within the bounding box of surface v20, and the angle `-0.9079` maintains an orientation consistent with the initial configuration. The plan is straightforward and
