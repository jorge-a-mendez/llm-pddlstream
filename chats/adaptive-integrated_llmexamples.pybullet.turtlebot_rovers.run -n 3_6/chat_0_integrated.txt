           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which can be satisfied by various conditions. Looking at the axioms, a possible way to satisfy it is to have `receivedimage` for `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` with `v11` (which is a mode), and `receivedanalysis` for `v5` (rock type v6) and `v8` (rock type v6) and `v1` (rock type v2) and `v4` (rock type v2) and `v3` (rock type v2) and `v7` (rock type v6), `atconf` for `v12` at `v13` and `v14` at `v15` and `free` for `v12` and `v14` for `v16`. The `atconf` and `free` predicates are already true in the initial state, so we need to focus on `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`.
           
           Let's break down the goal:
           1. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: Need to take an image of `v17` and send it.
           2. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Need to take an image of `v18` and send it.
           3. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: Need to take an image of `v19` and send it.
           4. `receivedanalysis(v5)`: Need to sample `v5` and send analysis.
           5. `receivedanalysis(v8)`: Need to sample `v8` and send analysis.
           6. `receivedanalysis(v1)`: Need to sample `v1` and send analysis.
           7. `receivedanalysis(v4)`: Need to sample `v4` and send analysis.
           8. `receivedanalysis(v3)`: Need to sample `v3` and send analysis.
           9. `receivedanalysis(v7)`: Need to sample `v7` and send analysis.
           
           We have two rovers: `v12` and `v14`. Both are at their respective initial configurations (`v13` and `v15`). Both have a camera `v10` onboard which supports mode `v11`. Both have a free store `v16`.
           
           Let's address `receivedimage` first.
           For `v17`: `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` are true.
           For `v18`: `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` are true.
           For `v19`: `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)` are true.
           
           Let's use `v12` for `v17`, `v14` for `v18`, and `v12` for `v19`.
           To take an image, the camera needs to be calibrated.
           1. `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)`
           2. `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`
           3. `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`
           4. `calibrate(v14, #o3, #o4, v18, v10)`
           5. `take_image(v14, #o3, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`
           6. `send_image(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`
           7. `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v19, v10)` (This calibration is needed because `take_image` uncalibrates the camera. So even if `v12` was already calibrated for `v17`, it needs to be calibrated again for `v19`).
           8. `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v19, v10, v11)`
           9. `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v19, v11)`
           
           Now for `receivedanalysis`.
           We need to sample each rock and send the analysis. Both rovers can sample rocks when they are above them. `above(v12, #o5, <rock>)` and `above(v14, #o5, <rock>)` are true for all rocks.
           Let's use `v12` to sample `v5`, `v8`, `v1`, `v4`, `v3`, `v7`.
           Since `v12` only has one store `v16`, it can only sample one rock at a time. It will need to sample, send, then drop to free up the store for the next sample.
           However, we need `receivedanalysis` for all the rocks. We have two rovers `v12` and `v14`. They both have a free store `v16`. This store is a shared resource, meaning if `v12` fills `v16`, `v14` cannot use it until `v12` drops its sample. This is an issue in the domain, it seems `store(?s)` is an individual store for each rover not a global one. The `free(?v, ?s)` predicate indicates that `?s` is a store of rover `?v`. Thus `v16` is a store for `v12` AND `v14`. This is not realistic. However, let's assume `v16` is a general store and a rover can use it if it's free. The problem states `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`. This means both rovers have access to `v16`. But `full(?v, ?s)` implies the store is tied to a rover. Let's assume `v16` is just a type of store, and each rover has its own capacity of type `v16`. Or rather, it's a global resource and both rovers can access it. But `full(v12, v16)` means `v12` has filled `v16`. `free(v14, v16)` would mean `v14` has its own `v16` that is free. Given the initial state, it seems `v16` is available for both. This means each rover has a `v16` store.
           
           Let's use `v12` for `v5`, `v8`, `v1`.
           Let's use `v14` for `v4`, `v3`, `v7`.
           
           For `v12`:
           1. `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v5, v16)`
           2. `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v5)`
           3. `drop_rock(v12, v16)` (This frees up `v12`'s `v16` store, assuming it's specific to the rover)
           4. `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v8, v16)`
           5. `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v8)`
           6. `drop_rock(v12, v16)`
           7. `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v1, v16)`
           8. `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v1)`
           9. `drop_rock(v12, v16)`
           
           For `v14`:
           1. `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v4, v16)`
           2. `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v4)`
           3. `drop_rock(v14, v16)`
           4. `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v3, v16)`
           5. `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v3)`
           6. `drop_rock(v14, v16)`
           7. `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v7, v16)`
           8. `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v7)`
           9. `drop_rock(v14, v16)`
           
           The order of actions between rovers doesn't matter for the goal, as long as preconditions are met. We need to be careful with configurations.
           `#o3` is a configuration for imaging objectives `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           `#o5` is a configuration for sampling rocks `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           `#o0` is a configuration for communicating with lander `v9`.
           
           It seems likely that #o3, #o5, and #o0 could represent different configurations of the rover for different tasks. However, the problem statement says "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration..."
           This means we need to provide values for #o0, #o3, #o5.
           
           Given the existing objects:
           `v12` at `v13` ((1.0, -1.75, 3.142))
           `v14` at `v15` ((-1.0, -1.75, 0.0))
           
           Objectives to image:
           `v17` ((-1.861, 1.796), (-1.77, 1.886))
           `v18` ((1.826, 2.033), (1.901, 2.108))
           `v19` ((0.355, 2.065), (0.448, 2.158))
           
           Lander for communication:
           `v9` ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))
           
           Rocks for sampling:
           `v1` ((-2.208, 0.703), (-2.123, 0.789))
           `v3` ((0.954, 1.72), (1.059, 1.825))
           `v4` ((2.069, -0.234), (2.167, -0.136))
           `v5` ((1.088, -2.245), (1.222, -2.111))
           `v7` ((-1.129, -0.194), (-1.015, -0.08))
           `v8` ((-1.54, 1.822), (-1.411, 1.951))
           
           Let's assume the rovers don't need to move to a new configuration for different tasks if they already satisfy `conf(rover, #<conf_name>)` and `atconf(rover, #<conf_name>)` with the continuous values provided for these, so we use #o3 for imaging and #o5 for sampling, and #o0 for communication for both rovers, since `conf` predicates are set for both.
           
           For `imagevisible`, the maximum distance is 2.
           For `comvisible`, the maximum distance is 4.

           It appears the rovers are too far from `v17`, `v18`, `v19` to take images from their initial configurations `v13` and `v15`. However, the initial state provides `imagevisible` predicates for configurations `#o3`, meaning there *exist* configurations that are visible. The problem states: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state... then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration..."
           This implies we *must* use `#o3` for imaging, and since `imagevisible` predicates are given for `#o3`, they must be valid positions, we just need to calculate them.
           
           Let's find suitable configurations for `v12` to image `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           Let's choose a configuration for `v12` to image `v17`. `v17` is at ((-1.861, 1.796), (-1.77, 1.886)). Let's pick (-1.8, 1.8) as a target point. Rover `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). We need a point within 2 units. Let's try to place `v12` at (-1.0, 1.8) to image `v17`. This is within 2 units of `v17`. `(-1.0, 1.8)` is far from `v13`. We need to use `#o3` for this.
           For `v12` and `v17`, let's assume `#o3` (for `v12` and `v17`) is at (-1.0, 1.8).
           For `v12` and `v18`, let's assume `#o3` (for `v12` and `v18`) is at (1.0, 2.0).
           For `v12` and `v19`, let's assume `#o3` (for `v12` and `v19`) is at (0.0, 2.0).
           
           For `v14` and `v18`, let's assume `#o3` (for `v14` and `v18`) is at (1.0, 2.0). (This is too close to the previous one, let's keep it separate).
           For `v14` and `v17`, let's assume `#o3` (for `v14` and `v17`) is at (-1.0, 1.8).
           For `v14` and `v19`, let's assume `#o3` (for `v14` and `v19`) is at (0.0, 2.0).
           
           However, the problem says "If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name."
           The same #o3 is used for different image targets. This implies #o3 is one configuration that can image all targets from that location. This is unlikely to be true geometrically, so I will define different configurations that are specific to `(rover, target_object)` pairs.
           Let's use `#o3-v12-v17`, `#o3-v12-v18`, `#o3-v12-v19`, `#o3-v14-v17`, `#o3-v14-v18`, `#o3-v14-v19`. These are all different instances of the `#o3` template. This is consistent with how the PDDL is typically interpreted with continuous parameters. But the given initial state does not have these. Instead, it has `conf(v12, #o3)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`. This means that `#o3` must be a single configuration that makes all three `v17`, `v18`, `v19` visible from `v12`. This is very restrictive. Similarly for `v14`.
           Given the problem statement, I must assume that `#o3` is a single configuration from which all imaging targets `v17, v18, v19` are visible for `v12`, and a single configuration from which `v17, v18, v19` are visible for `v14`. This makes the problem much harder from a geometry perspective but simplifies the plan. So I'll assign two values for `#o3`, one for `v12` and one for `v14`. And the same for `#o0` and `#o5`.
           
           Let's assume the problem means that `#o3` refers to a specific configuration point for `v12` that can see all three objects (v17, v18, v19), and similarly for `v14`. This is unlikely geometrically, but I will proceed with this interpretation, as the PDDL description specifies that these imagevisible predicates are true for the given `#o3`.
           So, `v12` must move to `#o3` to image `v17`, `v18`, `v19`. And `v14` must move to `#o3` (a separate instance of this continuous parameter) to image `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           
           Similarly, `v12` moves to `#o5` for all sampling, and `v14` moves to `#o5` for all sampling.
           Both rovers use `#o0` for communication.
           
           Let's use `v12` for all image captures.
           Let's use `v14` for all rock analysis. This seems like a good division of labor.
           
           For `v12` imaging `v17`, `v18`, `v19`:
           1. `move(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)`: `v12` moves from `v13` to `#o3` to image targets.
           2. `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)`
           3. `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`
           4. `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v18, v10)`
           5. `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`
           6. `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v19, v10)`
           7. `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v19, v10, v11)`
           8. `move(v12, #o3, #o2, #o0)`: `v12` moves from `#o3` to `#o0` for communication.
           9. `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`
           10. `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`
           11. `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v19, v11)`
           
           For `v14` analyzing all rocks `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`:
           1. `move(v14, v15, #o2, #o5)`: `v14` moves from `v15` to `#o5` to sample rocks.
           2. `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v1, v16)`
           3. `move(v14, #o5, #o2, #o0)`: `v14` moves from `#o5` to `#o0` for communication.
           4. `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v1)`
           5. `drop_rock(v14, v16)`
           6. `move(v14, #o0, #o2, #o5)`: `v14` moves back to `#o5` for next sample.
           7. `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v3, v16)`
           8. `move(v14, #o5, #o2, #o0)`
           9. `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v3)`
           10. `drop_rock(v14, v16)`
           11. `move(v14, #o0, #o2, #o5)`
           12. `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v4, v16)`
           13. `move(v14, #o5, #o2, #o0)`
           14. `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v4)`
           15. `drop_rock(v14, v16)`
           16. `move(v14, #o0, #o2, #o5)`
           17. `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v5, v16)`
           18. `move(v14, #o5, #o2, #o0)`
           19. `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v5)`
           20. `drop_rock(v14, v16)`
           21. `move(v14, #o0, #o2, #o5)`
           22. `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v7, v16)`
           23. `move(v14, #o5, #o2, #o0)`
           24. `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v7)`
           25. `drop_rock(v14, v16)`
           26. `move(v14, #o0, #o2, #o5)`
           27. `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v8, v16)`
           28. `move(v14, #o5, #o2, #o0)`
           29. `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v8)`
           30. `drop_rock(v14, v16)`
           
           This plan seems valid under the interpretation that `v16` is a per-rover store. If `v16` were a global store, only one rover could use it at a time. The problem is a little ambiguous here, but the `free(?v, ?s)` predicate suggests `?s` is a store available to `?v`.
           
           The `motion(?v, ?q1, ?t, ?q2)` predicates in the initial state are `motion(v12, v13, #o2, v13)` and `motion(v14, v15, #o2, v15)`. This means we can only move from `v13` to `v13` or `v15` to `v15` using trajectory `#o2`. This implies that `#o2` is a zero-length trajectory, meaning the robot cannot move. This makes the goal unreachable. The problem specifies that any action instance not in the given list is not allowed. The only `move` actions allowed are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`. These actions essentially do nothing as they move a rover from a configuration to the same configuration. Therefore, the rovers cannot move to `#o3`, `#o5`, or `#o0`. This means any action that requires a rover to be at `#o3`, `#o5`, or `#o0` will have unsatisfied preconditions. Since all `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions require the rover to be at a specific configuration (which is not its initial `atconf` state for imaging/sampling/communication), and the rovers cannot move to those configurations, the goal is unreachable.
           
           Let's re-read the problem very carefully: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." The allowed `move` actions are:
           `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))`
           `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`
           This strictly limits the rovers to stay at their initial configurations.
           `v12` is at `v13`.
           `v14` is at `v15`.
           
           Let's check if the current configurations can satisfy the goal.
           For `take_image`: Requires `atconf(?v, ?q)`.
           If we can image from `v13` or `v15`, we don't need to move.
           However, `imagevisible` predicates are given for `#o3`, not `v13` or `v15`.
           `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)`
           `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`
           Same for `v14`.
           This means `v12` needs to be at `#o3` to image, not `v13`.
           Similarly for `comvisible` to send images/analysis:
           `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           This means `v12` needs to be at `#o0` to communicate, not `v13`.
           Similarly for `above` to sample rocks:
           `above(v12, #o5, v4)`
           `above(v12, #o5, v3)`
           ...and all other rocks for `v12` and `v14`.
           This means `v12` needs to be at `#o5` to sample, not `v13`.
           
           Since the allowed `move` actions only permit the rovers to "move" to their current configurations, they cannot reach `#o0`, `#o3`, or `#o5`. Therefore, actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` cannot be executed. This makes the goal unreachable.
           
           The `conf` facts in the initial state are `conf(v12, v13)`, `conf(v14, v15)`, `conf(v12, #o5)`, `conf(v12, #o3)`, `conf(v12, #o0)`, `conf(v14, #o3)`, `conf(v14, #o5)`, `conf(v14, #o0)`. These just define that these are valid configurations. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` specify the current configuration.
           
           The only way to achieve the goal would be if these continuous parameters (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`) were equal to the starting configurations (`v13`, `v15`) or if there were allowed `move` actions to these configurations. Neither is the case.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
           
           Final check on the axioms:
           Axiom new-axiom@0()
             Conjunction
               Atom atconf(v12, v13)
               Atom atconf(v14, v15)
               Atom free(v12, v16)
               Atom free(v14, v16)
               Atom receivedimage(v17, v11)
               Atom receivedimage(v18, v11)
               Atom receivedimage(v19, v11)
               Atom type(?stone, v2)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?stone)
               Atom type(?soil, v6)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?soil)
           
           The `atconf` and `free` parts of the axiom are satisfied by the initial state. The other parts (`receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`) require actions that cannot be performed due to lack of movement capabilities.
           
           Thus, the plan is not possible.
           
           The objects `v1`, `v3`, `v4` are type `v2` (stone).
           The objects `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are type `v6` (soil).
           So the goal requires `receivedanalysis(v1)`, `receivedanalysis(v3)`, `receivedanalysis(v4)`, `receivedanalysis(v5)`, `receivedanalysis(v7)`, `receivedanalysis(v8)`.
           
           My previous analysis stands. The goal is unreachable because the rovers cannot move to the necessary configurations for imaging, sampling, or communicating.
