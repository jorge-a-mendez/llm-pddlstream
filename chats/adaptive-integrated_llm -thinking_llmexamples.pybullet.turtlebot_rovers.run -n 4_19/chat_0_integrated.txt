           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable: Insufficient Action Set**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with figuring out a plan to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`. Looking at the axiom, it boils down to two key aspects: getting images for four objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`) using mode `v11`, and receiving analysis for all stones and soils, specifically `v4`, `v3`, `v1` (stones) and `v7`, `v8`, `v5` (soils).
           
           To get those images, I'd need to use `send_image`.  To get the analyses, I'd have to use `send_analysis`.  I know there are rovers (`v12`, `v14`), and a camera (`v10`). The preconditions for the required actions (like `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`) all include factors like being at the right configuration, being visible, etc. But here's the kicker: the only available actions listed are `move` (staying in place, in this case) and `drop_rock`. Crucially,  `send_image` and `send_analysis` aren't allowed.
           
           Since those two actions are essential to achieve the goal literals `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` respectively, and because the problem states I can *only* use the listed actions, the goal is simply unattainable. It's a non-starter. There's no way to reach the required state from the initial state given the limited action set.
