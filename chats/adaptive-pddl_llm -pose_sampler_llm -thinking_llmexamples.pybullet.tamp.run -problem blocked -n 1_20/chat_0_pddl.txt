(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation for Object ID 5 on Surface surf_0**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to find 50 stable placements for an object with ID 5, dimensions 0.07 x 0.07, on a single surface, `surf_0`, defined by the coordinates ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  A stable placement means the object is fully contained within the surface boundaries. I'll need to output the `surf_idx`, `theta`, x, and y coordinates for each of these 50 placements.  `theta` is the rotation, and for axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs), I'm considering only 0 and pi/2.
           
           First, let's analyze `surf_0`. It has an x-range from 4.2 to 4.8 and a y-range from -0.6 to 0.0, giving us a width and height of 0.6.  The object is essentially square, with dimensions of 0.07 x 0.07.  Since the object is almost square, I'll stick to a theta of 0 to simplify things.  This will keep the effective bounding box the same for theta = 0 or theta = pi/2.
           
           For a rotation of 0, the object's AABB will have the same dimensions as the object, 0.07 x 0.07.  The center point `(x, y)` needs to satisfy these conditions: it must be at least object_w/2 from the min x and at most object_w/2 from the max x for the surf. Likewise the y center has to be within bounds. This means `4.235 <= x <= 4.765` and `-0.565 <= y <= -0.035`.  That gives us a lot of space, as the surface is much larger than the object.
           
           To generate 50 unique placements, I'll use a grid strategy within the valid x and y ranges. I’ll start by creating the precise ranges and then rounding for display as needed.  I calculated the exact ranges using the precise object dimensions. The precise x range is [4.235000000000014, 4.764999999999986], and the precise y range is [-0.565000000000000025, -0.034999999999999975].  With a step size of 0.05, this will generate an 11 x 11 grid.
           
           I will iterate through this grid and pick the first 50 placements ( surf_idx = 0, theta = 0, x, y )  The approach generates a grid of potential placements, from which 50 will be returned.  No collisions with other objects are considered at this stage. I've ensured a reasonable distance between the object's center and the surface's boundary for stability. The values will be formatted to a reasonable number of decimal places for ease of readability, e.g., 5-6. The logic ensures each object is placed fully contained within the defined surface.
