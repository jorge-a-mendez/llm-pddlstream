           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning Through Goal Unreachability in `pr2-tamp`**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. The objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a specific type *on* a particular object. Specifically, we need an object `?green` that is `on v18` and has a certain type, let's call it `v17`. The crucial part is getting something *on* `v18`.
           
           The `on` predicate requires an object to be at a specific pose supported by another object. Initially, I identified `v8` and `v12` as potential candidates for `?green` because they have the required type. However, based on the initial state, neither is currently positioned on `v18`. To get either object on `v18`, I would need to use `pick` and `place` actions to manipulate their poses.
           
           The challenge lies in the *allowed* actions. I'm only given a single `move_base` action instance: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  This constrains the plan significantly. Because I do not have permitted `pick` or `place` instances, I cannot change the `atpose` of any object. I cannot move `v8` or `v12` onto `v18`.
           
           Examining the rules, any action not explicitly listed is prohibited. Given this restriction, it's clear the goal is unachievable. There's no way to reach the required pose for an object on `v18` without `pick` and `place`. Therefore, I conclude the initial goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable with the given action set. The provided `move_base` action doesn't contribute towards changing object positions, so it's irrelevant to the goal's achievement.
