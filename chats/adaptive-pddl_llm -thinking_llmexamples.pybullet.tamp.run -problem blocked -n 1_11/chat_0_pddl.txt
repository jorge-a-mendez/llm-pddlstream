           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unreachable Goal: New Axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. My goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which I've determined to mean finding an object, let's call it `?green`, that's both `on v18` and has a `type v17`.  I've identified two candidate objects that fit the `type v17` criteria: `v12` and `v8`. Now, the challenge is getting one of them *on* `v18`.
           
           To be `on v18`, an object needs to be both *supported* by `v18` at some *pose*, and actually *be* at that pose. Looking at the initial state, I see that `v12` is currently *on* `v14` and `v8` is *on* `v11`. Neither is directly supported by `v18` in the initial configuration.
           
           Thinking about how to achieve `on(?green, v18)`, I need to perform a `pick` and `place` sequence. I would pick up either `v12` or `v8` and place it onto `v18` at a suitable pose. The initial state does show that `v12` and `v8` *could* be supported by `v18` at pose `#o2`.
           
           However, here's the problem: the *only* available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action doesn't involve manipulation like picking or placing. It simply repositions the robot's base.  The actions needed to change object positions and achieve the goal -- namely `pick` and `place` -- are not available.
           
           Therefore, because I lack the necessary manipulation actions to move `v12` or `v8` to `v18`, I must conclude that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently *unreachable* given the available actions. There's no way to change the supporting relationships and object poses with the actions provided.
