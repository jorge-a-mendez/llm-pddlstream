(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of a Small Object**
           
           My task is to generate 50 stable placements for a small object, which I'll represent as a square with side length 0.07, on a given rectangular surface (Surface 0). "Stable" means the object is fully contained within the surface, regardless of rotation.  The surface has these bounds: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  Essentially, I'm finding places to put this object in a way that *all* of it will fit inside the rectangle.
           
           I know how to calculate the bounding box size of the object after it's been rotated by an angle, 'theta'. It's the axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)  dimensions that I'm considering, so I need to find its extent in x and y after rotation. For a square, I can simplify things.  The 'effective side' of the rotated object's bounding box will depend on the angle. I can then figure out a safe range of x and y to place the center of my object at.
           
           The object's size is much smaller than the surface, so I have a lot of room to work with. To generate diverse placements, I'll rotate the object at five different angles (0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi radians). For each angle, I'll distribute the object's center across the surface's area. I'll need to make sure the object’s center is placed far enough from the edges to fit entirely within the bounds of the surface.
           
           To summarize, for each angle, I’ll calculate the allowed range for *x* and *y* placement. After that, I'll make a list of placements with x and y coordinates that fit my requirements.
           I’m selecting a set of evenly distributed x and y positions.
           After the calculations I have 50 positions each with the placement angle, and x and y center coordinates of the object.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Strategy for Object ID 10 Placement**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new request for Object ID 10, and it's got dimensions of 0.0735 x 0.0735, which is essentially the same as the previous objects I placed.  The surface bounds remain the same:  `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. The key constraint here is that I need to avoid collision with any existing objects, specifically Object ID 5, which has been successfully placed.
           
           I’ve got 10 known successful placements for Object ID 5, all at a rotation of 0.  This is important. These placements effectively define the "forbidden zones" for Object ID 10. They form the AABB of those existing objects.
           
           To solve this, I'm going to create an algorithm with the following strategy: I'm going to search through the surface's coordinate space and test placement points with five rotation angles that are: 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3\*pi/4, and pi. I need to calculate the bounding boxes for object 10 under different rotations. For each potential (x, y) center point, I'll check two things:  1) Is the object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) within the surface bounds? and 2) Does the object’s AABB collide with *any* of the 10 known AABBs of the successfully placed Object ID 5's?
           
           I know that Objects ID 5 and 10 are similar in size.  If I consider `size_x = 0.07351454936831203` and `size_y = 0.07351454936831286`, then for 0 and pi/2 I get `half_eff_x = 0.036757` and `half_eff_y = 0.036757`. For rotations like pi/4 and 3\*pi/4 I have slightly larger bounding boxes with half extents of 0.05197 for both `x` and `y`.
           
           The 10 successful placements for ID 5 (each with `0.07 x 0.07` dimensions) are well known. The strategy now is to avoid those bounding boxes. And to choose non-colliding points I'm making sure that the coordinates used by the AABBs in both X and Y never overlap. The collision criteria are simple. So if I have two AABBs where the max extent is greater than the min extent of the other and the min extent is less than the max extent, a collision occurs.
           
           **Generating Placements and Collision Checks**
           
           I've carefully calculated the AABB for a square object under different rotation. It's time to find 50 placements.
           
           After carefully analyzing where ID5 placed in the scene, and after taking into account some small errors in some initial analyses, I created a set of non-colliding points.
           
           For each rotation I generated the 10 points that should be valid.
           
           After calculating, and confirming the coordinates I have now a comprehensive set of 50 non-colliding placement points. This approach should satisfy the constraint of no collisions with previously placed objects.
           
           Let's test this in the system and verify the output.
