           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.196, 0.513)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.526, -0.185), (-4.433, -0.092)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.479, -0.139, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.211, 0.977).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Achieving `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which means having a specific object, identified as `?green`, both "on" a particular surface, `v18`, and of a specific "type," `v17`. My analysis reveals that `?green` is actually `v12`, as `v12` is defined as having `type(v12, v17)`. The initial setup has `v12` already in a pose, supported by `v14`.  My current objective is to make `v12` "on" the desired surface, `v18`.
           
           To achieve this, the system offers an existing plan. I need to get `v12` from its current pose (`v13`) to a new pose on the target surface (`v18`). The specific pose needs to satisfy the *`on`* axiom, which is defined by support and pose.
           
           Given the initial state, I can see that `v12`'s current pose is associated with a "supported" relationship on `v18`, and so my plan has a goal of `atpose(v12, #p1)` where `v12` will be "on" `v18`. I need to ensure that the chosen pose is a safe and logical configuration.
           
           I must orchestrate a sequence of actions: `move_base`, `pick`, and `place`. First, `move_base` to a reachable position, then I can use `pick` to acquire the object `v12`, then another `move_base` is needed to reposition and then the object can be placed. The object, currently held, needs to be moved to a suitable position on `v18`, such as a safe spot.
           
           The robot arm, represented by `v4`, starts empty, which I can verify in the initial state. The base configuration is `v3`. I will evaluate the available movement actions, identify the necessary movements, and subsequently pick and place, with the base in position.
           
           Before performing the pick, I've got to ensure the base is in the necessary configuration to make the pick possible. It's currently at `v3` and must move to a new base configuration, `#q2`, for the pick action. I'll need to check the preconditions: the required base positions, the arm's accessibility, and make sure that there are no collisions.
           
           Upon successful pick, I will transition `v12` to a state where the arm holds the object, which is now supported and held. After the pickup, the robot must then reposition to another location and then move `v12` to its final pose on `v18`, with the appropriate pose as indicated in the goal's requirements.
           
           To reach the desired state, I have to pick, and then place, verifying that the new proposed pose on `v18` is supported, is non-colliding, and at a base position suitable for the robot arm. The new pose will now be the key to satisfying my ultimate goal of `on(v12, v18)`, confirming that `v12` meets the conditions required by the axiom for `new-axiom@0()`.
           
           Essentially, I will perform the necessary movement to get `v12` on to `v18` in order for `new-axiom@0()` to be true.
