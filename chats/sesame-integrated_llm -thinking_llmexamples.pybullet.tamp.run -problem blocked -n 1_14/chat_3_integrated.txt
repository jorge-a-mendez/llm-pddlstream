           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.196, 0.513)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.526, -0.185), (-4.433, -0.092)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.479, -0.139, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.211, 0.977).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **Expert Summary: Achieving `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which I've unpacked to mean getting object `v12` onto surface `v18` with the proper *type*. I know from the starting situation that `type(v12, v17)` is already true, so the task is really to get `v12` on `v18`, i.e., `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           My strategy? Pick `v12` from where it currently is (`v13`) and place it onto a stable position on `v18`. I've analyzed the available actions – `pick` and `place` – and they *both* need the robot's base to be at a specific "base configuration", `#o3`. I also know `v12` is at its start position `atpose(v12, v13)`.
           
           Here's the plan:
           1.  **`move_base v3 #o3 #o0`**: First, I'll need to move the base from its initial location (`v3`) to the required base configuration `#o3`. This assumes base trajectory `#o0` exists.
           2.  **`pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4`**: Pick up `v12` from `v13` using the arm `v4`. The arm trajectory is `#o4`.
           3.  **`place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`**: Place `v12` down at its destination, which I will compute using `#o2`.
           
           The critical piece is defining `#o2`. It has to be a safe, collision-free placement for `v12` on `v18`. From the scene's geometry, I've determined that a stable pose is x=4.5, y=-0.3 and a safe placement for `v12` is at z=0.8 (assuming `v18` at height 0.75 and `v12` height=0.1.
           Finally, there is no need for rotations.
           
           Therefore, `#o2` is at `(4.5 -0.3 0.8 0.0)`. (x,y,z,theta).
           
           That should do it. It should get the job done at cost `distance(v3, #o3) + 2` with the given assumptions. And that will satisfy the goal!
