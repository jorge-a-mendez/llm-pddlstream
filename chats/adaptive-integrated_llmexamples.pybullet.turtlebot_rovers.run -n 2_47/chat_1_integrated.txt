           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0` predicate. This axiom requires several conditions to be met:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: Both rovers are at their base configurations. These are already true in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: Both rovers' stores are free. These are already true in the initial state.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 must be received.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: A rock of type `v2` (stone) must be analyzed and the analysis received. The rocks of type `v2` are `v1`, `v3`, `v4`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: A rock of type `v6` (soil) must be analyzed and the analysis received. The rocks of type `v6` are `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           
           The plan will involve the following steps:
           - Calibrate a camera on a rover.
           - Take images of objectives v17 and v18.
           - Send the images to the lander.
           - Move a rover to a configuration above a rock of type v2.
           - Sample the rock.
           - Move the rover to a configuration where it can communicate with the lander.
           - Send the analysis of the rock.
           - Repeat the sampling and sending for a rock of type v6.
           
           We can use `rover v14` for image taking and `rover v14` for sampling the rocks since it's already at `v15` which is close to `v3` and `v7` in `#o5`. It is also stated that `v14` can image `v17` and `v18` from `#o3`. It can also communicate from `#o0`.
           
           For `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           - Rover `v14` can move to configuration `#o3` to image `v17` and `v18`.
           - `v10` is a camera on `v14` and supports `v11`.
           - Calibrate `v10` for `v14` at `#o3`.
           - Take images of `v17` and `v18`.
           - Move `v14` to configuration `#o0` for communication.
           - Send the images.
           
           For `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (type `v2` rocks: `v1`, `v3`, `v4`):
           - `v3` is a stone rock (type `v2`) and `v14` can be `above(#o5, v3)`.
           - Move `v14` to configuration `#o5`.
           - Sample `v3` using `v16`.
           - Move `v14` to configuration `#o0` for communication.
           - Send the analysis of `v3`.
           
           For `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (type `v6` rocks: `v5`, `v7`, `v8`):
           - `v7` is a soil rock (type `v6`) and `v14` can be `above(#o5, v7)`.
           - Move `v14` to configuration `#o5`.
           - Sample `v7` using `v16`.
           - Move `v14` to configuration `#o0` for communication.
           - Send the analysis of `v7`.
           
           This plan utilizes `v14` to complete all necessary tasks.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0` predicate. This axiom requires several conditions to be met:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: Both rovers are at their base configurations. These are already true in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: Both rovers' stores are free. These are already true in the initial state.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 must be received.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: A rock of type `v2` (stone) must be analyzed and the analysis received. The rocks of type `v2` are `v1`, `v3`, `v4`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: A rock of type `v6` (soil) must be analyzed and the analysis received. The rocks of type `v6` are `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           
           The plan will involve the following steps:
           - Calibrate a camera on a rover.
           - Take images of objectives v17 and v18.
           - Send the images to the lander.
           - Move a rover to a configuration above a rock of type v2.
           - Sample the rock.
           - Move the rover to a configuration where it can communicate with the lander.
           - Send the analysis of the rock.
           - Repeat the sampling and sending for a rock of type v6.
           
           We can use `rover v14` for image taking and `rover v14` for sampling the rocks since it's already at `v15` which is close to `v3` and `v7` in `#o5`. It is also stated that `v14` can image `v17` and `v18` from `#o3`. It can also communicate from `#o0`.
           
           For `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           - Rover `v14` can move to configuration `#o3` to image `v17` and `v18`.
           - `v10` is a camera on `v14` and supports `v11`.
           - Calibrate `v10` for `v14` at `#o3`.
           - Take images of `v17` and `v18`.
           - Move `v14` to configuration `#o0` for communication.
           - Send the images.
           
           For `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (type `v2` rocks: `v1`, `v3`, `v4`):
           - `v3` is a stone rock (type `v2`) and `v14` can be `above(#o5, v3)`.
           - Move `v14` to configuration `#o5`.
           - Sample `v3` using `v16`.
           - Move `v14` to configuration `#o0` for communication.
           - Send the analysis of `v3`.
           
           For `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (type `v6` rocks: `v5`, `v7`, `v8`):
           - `v7` is a soil rock (type `v6`) and `v14` can be `above(#o5, v7)`.
           - Move `v14` to configuration `#o5`.
           - Sample `v7` using `v16`.
           - Move `v14` to configuration `#o0` for communication.
           - Send the analysis of `v7`.
           
           This plan utilizes `v14` to complete all necessary tasks.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0` predicate. This axiom requires several conditions to be met:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: Both rovers are at their base configurations. These are already true in the initial state.

           The previous plan failed due to collisions and unreachable configurations. Let's re-evaluate.
           
           For image taking, `v14` needs to be in a configuration that can image `v17` and `v18`. Since `#o3` was in collision, we need to find new configurations for `imagevisible`. The initial state gives us `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`. Since these are defined from the same `#o3` configuration, it means `#o3` should be a location from which both `v17` and `v18` are visible. However, the feedback shows that `#o3` as specified was in collision with `v17` and `v18` themselves, which means the rover was trying to occupy the same space as the objectives. This is incorrect. A new collision-free and occlusion-free configuration for imaging needs to be found.
           Given the previous AABBs for `v17` and `v18`:
           `v17`: ((-1.848, 1.916), (-1.753, 2.011))
           `v18`: ((0.254, 1.903), (0.343, 1.993))
           The rover `v14` (whose base configuration `v15` is at (-1.0, -1.75)) needs to move to a configuration `#o3_new` from which it can see both `v17` and `v18`. The targets are on the "north" side. We need to find a point somewhat south of both, and far enough not to collide.
           A possible configuration to see both would be (0.0, 1.0) or similar, but this depends on the specific geometry of other obstacles. Let's try to place `#o3` for `v14` to see `v17` and `v18` at a safe distance. A point like ( -0.5, 0.5) or (0.0, 0.5) could potentially see both. However, to guarantee sight and collision-free path, we should be further.
           Let's try a configuration such as (0.0, 0.0) for `#o3` as a starting point, and adjust it if there are further collisions.
           For `v17` at approx (-1.8, 1.96) and `v18` at approx (0.3, 1.95), a good viewing point from `v14` could be around (0.0, 0.0) or (0.0, 1.0). Let's go for (0.0, 0.0) initially.
           For communication, `v14` needs to be in a configuration `#o0_new` where it can see `v9`. `v9` is at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). `v15` is (-1.0, -1.75). The previous `#o0` was (-1.860, -1.900), which collided with `v9`. `v9` is south-west of `v15`. A communication point `#o0_new` should be south-east of `v9` to avoid collision but still have line of sight. Given the AABB of `v9`, a point like (-1.0, -2.0) or (-0.5, -2.0) should be clear and within communication range. Let's try (-1.0, -2.0).
           
           For sampling rocks, `v14` needs to be in a configuration `#o5_new` above `v3` and `v7`.
           `v3`: ((1.486, -1.209), (1.579, -1.116))
           `v7`: ((1.751, -0.804), (1.874, -0.68))
           `v15` is at (-1.0, -1.75). `v3` and `v7` are in the north-east direction relative to `v15`. The previous `#o5` was (1.532, -1.162) for `v3` and (1.812, -0.742) for `v7`. These were deemed unreachable. The configurations for `above` predicates usually involve the gripper being above the object, so the robot base needs to be in a reachable position. Let's try to place the rover `v14` at a configuration near `v3` and `v7`. A configuration like (1.2, -1.2) for `v3` and (1.6, -0.8) for `v7` might be reachable for the base and allow the gripper to be above. However, we need one single `#o5` configuration that works for both. Given `above` implies the gripper is extended, the base can be slightly further away. Let's choose a point like (1.0, -1.0) for `#o5` as a general sampling location which might allow the gripper to reach both.
           
           Let's adjust the plan with these new configurations.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0` predicate. This axiom requires several conditions to be met:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: Both rovers are at their base configurations. These are already true in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: Both rovers' stores are free. These are already true in the initial state.

           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: A rock of type `v2` (stone) must be analyzed and the analysis received. The rocks of type `v2` are `v1`, `v3`, `v4`.

           The previous plan failed due to collisions and unreachable configurations. Let's re-evaluate the configurations based on the detailed feedback regarding collisions and reachability. Rover `v14` is initially at `v15` = (-1.0, -1.75).
           
           For imaging objectives `v17` and `v18`:
           `v17`: ((-1.848, 1.916), (-1.753, 2.011))
           `v18`: ((0.254, 1.903), (0.343, 1.993))
           The rover `v14` needs to be in a position to view these. They are roughly to the north of the rover's starting position. A position such as `(0.0, 1.0)` was previously suggested, but then changed to `(-0.5, 0.5)` which was unreachable. Let's try `(0.0, 1.0)` for `#o3` for `v14`. This should be reachable and provide a good view without collision, given the rover can move on the ground plane.
           
           For communication with `v9` (lander):
           `v9`: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))
           The previous `#o0` at `(-1.0, -2.0)` was in collision with `v21`. `v21` is at `((-1.248, -2.085), (-1.107, -1.944))`. This suggests we need to move `v14` to a point that's clear of `v21` but still has line of sight to `v9`. `v9` is to the south-west of the initial rover position `v15`. A point like `(-0.5, -2.2)` or `(-1.5, -2.2)` might be suitable to avoid `v21` and see `v9`. Let's try `(-1.5, -2.2)` for `#o0`.
           
           For sampling rocks `v3` and `v7`:
           `v3`: ((1.486, -1.209), (1.579, -1.116))
           `v7`: ((1.751, -0.804), (1.874, -0.68))
           Both are to the north-east of the rover's initial position. The previous `#o5` at `(1.0, -1.0)` was unreachable. The rover `v14` must be positioned so its base is reachable and its arm can extend to `above` the rocks. Let's try to place `v14` slightly further away from the rocks to ensure reachability for the base, for instance, `(0.5, -1.0)` for `#o5`. This configuration should allow the arm to reach `v3` and `v7` if they are indeed above this position.
           
           The plan remains the same in terms of action sequence, only the continuous configurations need to be adjusted.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0` predicate. This axiom requires several conditions to be met:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: Both rovers are at their base configurations. These are already true in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: Both rovers' stores are free. These are already true in the initial state.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 must be received.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: A rock of type `v2` (stone) must be analyzed and the analysis received. The rocks of type `v2` are `v1`, `v3`, `v4`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: A rock of type `v6` (soil) must be analyzed and the analysis received. The rocks of type `v6` are `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           
           The previous plan failed due to collisions and unreachable configurations. Let's try again to find collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable configurations for `v14` (starting at `v15` = (-1.0, -1.75)).
           
           For imaging objectives `v17` and `v18`:
           `v17`: ((-1.848, 1.916), (-1.753, 2.011))
           `v18`: ((0.254, 1.903), (0.343, 1.993))
           Obstacle `v22` is at `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`, which is a thin vertical wall along the Y-axis at X=0.0. The previous `#o3` at `(0.0, 1.0)` was in collision with `v22`. We need to move `v14` to a position where it is not on the X=0.0 line. Since `v17` is to the left (negative X) and `v18` is to the right (positive X) of X=0, we can try to place `v14` at `(-0.2, 1.0)` for imaging. This should avoid `v22` and potentially allow viewing both objectives. Or, perhaps it's better to move to a positive X. Let's try `(0.2, 1.0)` for `#o3`.
           
           For communication with `v9` (lander):
           `v9`: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))
           The previous `#o0` at `(-1.5, -2.2)` was in collision with `v9`. This means the rover was trying to occupy the same space as the lander. The lander is quite large. We need to find a point that is outside `v9`'s AABB but still within communication range and line of sight. `v9` is primarily in the third quadrant. `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. Let's try to place `#o0` at `(-1.0, -2.5)`. This is further south, hopefully outside of `v9`.
           
           For sampling rocks `v3` and `v7`:
           `v3`: ((1.486, -1.209), (1.579, -1.116))
           `v7`: ((1.751, -0.804), (1.874, -0.68))
           Both are to the north-east of the rover's initial position. The previous `#o5` at `(0.5, -1.0)` was unreachable. The rover base needs to be closer to these rocks to reach them. Let's try `(1.0, -1.5)` for `#o5`. This is closer to `v3` and `v7` while still being somewhat away from the X=0.0 line to avoid `v22` if it's in the way.
           
           The plan remains the same in terms of action sequence, only the continuous configurations need to be adjusted.

           The previous plan failed due to collisions and unreachable configurations. Let's adjust the configurations once more, being very careful with the obstacles. Rover `v14` starts at `v15` = (-1.0, -1.75).
           
           For imaging objectives `v17` and `v18`:
           `v17`: ((-1.848, 1.916), (-1.753, 2.011))
           `v18`: ((0.254, 1.903), (0.343, 1.993))
           Obstacle `v22` is at `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`, a vertical wall along the Y-axis at X=0.0. The previous `#o3` at `(0.2, 1.0)` was still in collision with `v22`. This suggests that the robot is quite wide and even a small offset in X doesn't clear `v22`. We need to be further away from the X=0.0 line. Let's try `(0.5, 1.0)` for `#o3`. This should put `v14` sufficiently to the right of `v22`.
           
           For communication with `v9` (lander):
           `v9`: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))
           Obstacle `v23` is at `((-2.55, -2.55), (2.55, -2.45))`, which is a horizontal wall along the X-axis at Y=-2.5. The previous `#o0` at `(-1.0, -2.5)` was in collision with `v23`. This means the robot was trying to occupy the same space as this wall. We need to be either slightly above or below `Y=-2.5`. Given `v9` is further north, we should try a point like `(-1.0, -2.3)`. This will be clear of `v23` and also clear of `v9` (whose lower Y is -2.346, so -2.3 is slightly north of `v9`'s southern edge). Let's use `(-1.0, -2.3)` for `#o0`.
           
           For sampling rocks `v3` and `v7`:
           `v3`: ((1.486, -1.209), (1.579, -1.116))
           `v7`: ((1.751, -0.804), (1.874, -0.68))
           Both are to the north-east of the rover's initial position `v15` = (-1.0, -1.75). The previous `#o5` at `(1.0, -1.5)` was unreachable. This indicates that `v14` cannot easily reach this far to the east while maintaining a reachable base configuration. The maximum distance from `v14` to `v3` and `v7` could be an issue. Let's try moving `v14` to `(0.8, -1.7)` for `#o5`. This is closer to `v15` and potentially more reachable, while still being able to reach the rocks with the arm. This is still a bit far, but it's the closest we can get without running into `v22`.
           
           The plan remains the same in terms of action sequence, only the continuous configurations need to be adjusted.

           The previous plan failed due to collisions and unreachable configurations. Let's make one more attempt at finding suitable configurations for `v14` (starting at `v15` = (-1.0, -1.75)). This is proving challenging given the tight constraints and presence of multiple obstacles.
           
           For imaging objectives `v17` and `v18`:
           `v17`: ((-1.848, 1.916), (-1.753, 2.011))
           `v18`: ((0.254, 1.903), (0.343, 1.993))
           Obstacle `v24` is at `((0.401, 1.073), (0.538, 1.211))`. The previous `#o3` at `(0.5, 1.0)` was in collision with `v24`. `v24` is directly where we tried to place the rover. We need to find a viewing spot that avoids `v24`, `v22` (X=0.0 wall), and still gives a good view of `v17` and `v18`. Since `v24` is at X roughly 0.4-0.5, let's try moving `v14` to a slightly different spot, for example, `(0.7, 0.8)` for `#o3`. This attempts to move past `v24` in X and slightly down in Y, hopefully clearing any collision and maintaining line of sight.
           
           For communication with `v9` (lander):
           `v9`: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))
           Obstacle `v23` is at `((-2.55, -2.55), (2.55, -2.45))`. The previous `#o0` at `(-1.0, -2.3)` was in collision with `v23`. This is still too close to the horizontal wall. We need to move `v14` to a higher Y value to clear `v23`. Let's try `(-1.0, -2.0)` for `#o0`. This moves it closer to `v9`'s north edge, but `v9`'s max Y is `-1.654`, so `-2.0` should be clear.
           
           For sampling rocks `v3` and `v7`:
           `v3`: ((1.486, -1.209), (1.579, -1.116))
           `v7`: ((1.751, -0.804), (1.874, -0.68))
           The previous `#o5` at `(0.8, -1.7)` was unreachable. Rover `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. The base of the rover cannot reach so far to the east. It's likely that a configuration like `(1.0, -1.0)` or `(0.8, -1.7)` is just too far from the starting point `v15` or not in a clear path. Let's consider using `v12` if `v14` is unable to reach. `v12` starts at `v13` = `(1.0, -1.75)`. This is a much better starting point for reaching `v3` and `v7` as they are at `(1.486, -1.209)` and `(1.751, -0.804)`. Let's use `v12` for sampling.
           For `v12`, `v13` is `(1.0, -1.75)`. For sampling `v3` and `v7`, we need `#o5`. A configuration like `(1.0, -1.2)` for `#o5` for `v12` should be reachable and allow the arm to be above `v3` and `v7`.
           
           Now, we need to adapt the plan. `v14` will still handle imaging and sending images. `v12` will handle sampling and sending analysis.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0` predicate. This axiom requires several conditions to be met:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: Both rovers are at their base configurations. These are already true in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: Both rovers' stores are free. These are already true in the initial state.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 must be received.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: A rock of type `v2` (stone) must be analyzed and the analysis received. The rocks of type `v2` are `v1`, `v3`, `v4`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: A rock of type `v6` (soil) must be analyzed and the analysis received. The rocks of type `v6` are `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           
           The current strategy involves using `v14` for imaging and `v12` for sampling. Let's re-evaluate the configurations, focusing on reachability and collision avoidance.
           
           **Rover `v14` (starts at `v15` = (-1.0, -1.75)) for imaging and sending images:**
           
           For imaging objectives `v17` and `v18`:
           `v17`: ((-1.848, 1.916), (-1.753, 2.011))
           `v18`: ((0.254, 1.903), (0.343, 1.993))
           Obstacles encountered: `v22` (X=0.0 wall) and `v24` (at X roughly 0.4-0.5, Y roughly 1.0-1.2).
           The previous attempt at `(0.7, 0.8)` for `#o3` was not reachable. This indicates that moving this far to the east and north from `v15` might be problematic for `v14`. Let's reconsider a position for `v14` that is closer to its starting point but still provides a view of `v17` and `v18`. Given the AABBs of `v17` and `v18`, they are high up in the positive Y direction.
           Perhaps `v14` should move less in X and more in Y. Let's try `(-0.5, 0.0)` for `#o3`. This is closer to `v14`'s starting X, but still potentially provides line of sight to the objectives. This is still a guess; we are limited in how far we can move.
           
           For communication with `v9` (lander):
           `v9`: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))
           Obstacle `v21` is at `((-1.248, -2.085), (-1.107, -1.944))`. The previous `#o0` at `(-1.0, -2.0)` was in collision with `v21`. We need to move `v14` to a position that is clear of `v21` but still has line of sight to `v9`. `v21` is just south-east of `v9`. Let's try to move `v14` to `(-0.8, -2.0)`. This position is to the east of `v21` and south of `v9`.
           
           **Rover `v12` (starts at `v13` = (1.0, -1.75)) for sampling and sending analysis:**
           
           For sampling rocks `v3` and `v7`:
           `v3`: ((1.486, -1.209), (1.579, -1.116))
           `v7`: ((1.751, -0.804), (1.874, -0.68))
           The previous `#o5` at `(1.0, -1.2)` was unreachable for `v12`. `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`. The rocks are north-east. Let's try to place `#o5` for `v12` closer to `v13` while still allowing the gripper to reach. Maybe `(1.2, -1.5)`. This is slightly to the east and north from `v13`, hopefully reachable.
           
           For communication with `v9` (lander) from `v12`:
           `v9`: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))
           The `#o0` for `v12` is the same as for `v14` since it's a general communication point. So, we'll reuse `(-0.8, -2.0)`.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0` predicate. This axiom requires several conditions to be met:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: Both rovers are at their base configurations. These are already true in the initial state.

           The current plan is encountering persistent issues with reachability and occlusion. Let's analyze the problem more carefully. The robot bases are at `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)` for `v14` and `v13 = (1.0, -1.75)` for `v12`.
           
           **Rover `v14` (at `v15` = (-1.0, -1.75)) for imaging and sending images:**
           
           For imaging objectives `v17` and `v18`:
           `v17`: ((-1.848, 1.916), (-1.753, 2.011)) (Far North-West)
           `v18`: ((0.254, 1.903), (0.343, 1.993)) (Far North-East)
           The previous configuration `(-0.5, 0.0)` for `#o3` was not reachable. The objectives are quite far north. `v14` is in the southwest quadrant. Reaching a good vantage point for both `v17` and `v18` from `v14`'s starting position seems difficult. Given `v14` is on the negative X side and `v12` is on the positive X side, and both objectives are in the positive Y, it might be better to have `v14` image `v17` and `v12` image `v18` if a single `#o3` configuration for `v14` to see both proves impossible. Let's try to find an `#o3` for `v14` to see `v17` and another `#o3'` for `v12` to see `v18`.
           For `v14` to see `v17`: `v17` is at `X` about -1.8, `Y` about 1.9. `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. Let's try `(-1.0, 0.0)` for `#o3` for `v14` to see `v17`. This should be reachable for `v14`.
           For `v12` to see `v18`: `v18` is at `X` about 0.3, `Y` about 1.9. `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`. Let's try `(0.5, 0.0)` for `#o3_prime` for `v12` to see `v18`. This should be reachable for `v12`.
           
           For communication with `v9` (lander):
           `v9`: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)) (South-West corner)
           Previous configuration `(-0.8, -2.0)` for `#o0` was occluded. `v21` is at `((-1.248, -2.085), (-1.107, -1.944))`. We need to be clear of `v21` and `v9`. Let's try to place the rover further east, or further south, or both.
           Given `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)` and `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`, a common communication point for both would be advantageous. A point like `(-0.5, -2.2)` for `#o0` might work. This is south of `v21` and `v9`.
           
           **Rover `v12` (at `v13` = (1.0, -1.75)) for sampling and sending analysis:**
           
           For sampling rocks `v3` and `v7`:
           `v3`: ((1.486, -1.209), (1.579, -1.116))
           `v7`: ((1.751, -0.804), (1.874, -0.68))
           Previous `#o5` at `(1.2, -1.5)` was unreachable. `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`. The rocks are to the North-East. Let's try `(1.0, -1.0)` for `#o5`. This is directly north of the starting point of `v12` and should be reachable for the base and allow the arm to be above the targets.
           
           Now, let's restructure the plan to use both rovers for imaging.

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0` predicate. This axiom requires several conditions to be met:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: Both rovers are at their base configurations. These are already true in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: Both rovers' stores are free. These are already true in the initial state.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 must be received.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: A rock of type `v2` (stone) must be analyzed and the analysis received. The rocks of type `v2` are `v1`, `v3`, `v4`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: A rock of type `v6` (soil) must be analyzed and the analysis received. The rocks of type `v6` are `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           
           The previous plan used `#o3@prime` which was not allowed as a valid continuous parameter. Only `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are explicitly stated as continuous parameters from the initial state's `conf` predicates. We must reuse these. This means a single `#o3` must be used for all imaging actions if we want to use continuous parameters.
           
           Let's revert to the single `#o3` for `v14` for both image targets, but try to find a configuration that is both reachable and collision/occlusion-free.
           `v14` starts at `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)`.
           `v17`: ((-1.848, 1.916), (-1.753, 2.011))
           `v18`: ((0.254, 1.903), (0.343, 1.993))
           Given the wide range of X coordinates for `v17` and `v18`, trying to find one point `v14` can see both is hard. Let's place `#o3` for `v14` to be central to both objectives. A point like `(-0.5, 1.5)` for `#o3` might give a good view of both objectives, and it's somewhat far North from `v14`'s start, but hopefully reachable and avoids the X=0.0 wall `v22` and obstacle `v24`.
           
           For communication with `v9` (lander) from either rover:
           `v9`: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))
           Obstacle `v21` is at `((-1.248, -2.085), (-1.107, -1.944))`.
           Let's try a point further to the east for `#o0` to avoid `v21` and `v9` while still having line of sight to `v9`. `(-0.5, -2.0)` for `#o0` might work. This is to the east of `v21` and south of `v9`.
           
           For sampling rocks `v3` and `v7` from `v12`:
           `v12` starts at `v13 = (1.0, -1.75)`.
           `v3`: ((1.486, -1.209), (1.579, -1.116))
           `v7`: ((1.751, -0.804), (1.874, -0.68))
           The previous `#o5` at `(1.0, -1.0)` was unreachable. Let's try `(1.2, -1.2)` for `#o5`. This is slightly to the east and north from `v13`, and hopefully more reachable. It should also be clear of other obstacles.
           
           So, the plan structure will be:
           1. `v14` moves to `#o3`, calibrates, takes images of `v17` and `v18`.
           2. `v14` moves to `#o0`, sends images.
           3. `v12` moves to `#o5`, samples `v3`.
           4. `v12` moves to `#o0`, sends analysis of `v3`.
           5. `v12` moves back to `#o5`, samples `v7`.
           6. `v12` moves to `#o0`, sends analysis of `v7`.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0` predicate. This axiom requires several conditions to be met:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: Both rovers are at their base configurations. These are already true in the initial state.

           The current plan is failing due to collisions and unreachable configurations. Let's try to adjust the configurations once more.
           
           **Rover `v14` (at `v15` = (-1.0, -1.75)) for imaging and sending images:**
           
           For imaging objectives `v17` and `v18`:
           `v17`: ((-1.848, 1.916), (-1.753, 2.011))
           `v18`: ((0.254, 1.903), (0.343, 1.993))
           The previous `#o3` at `(-0.5, 1.5)` was not explicitly marked as collision or unreachable, but since previous imaging positions have been problematic, let's keep it as `(-0.5, 1.5)` for `#o3`. It's possible the issue lies in communication or sampling positions.
           
           For communication with `v9` (lander) from either rover:
           `v9`: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))
           Obstacle `v25` is at `((-0.506, -1.926), (-0.368, -1.789))`. The previous `#o0` at `(-0.5, -2.0)` was in collision with `v25`. This obstacle is very close to the intended communication point. We need to move `#o0` to a point that avoids `v25`, `v21` and `v9`. Let's try to place it further south and east. A point like `(0.0, -2.2)` for `#o0` might work. This is significantly to the east of `v21`, `v25`, and `v9`, and south enough from `v9` to ensure line of sight.
           
           **Rover `v12` (at `v13` = (1.0, -1.75)) for sampling and sending analysis:**
           
           For sampling rocks `v3` and `v7`:
           `v3`: ((1.486, -1.209), (1.579, -1.116))
           `v7`: ((1.751, -0.804), (1.874, -0.68))
           The previous `#o5` at `(1.2, -1.2)` was unreachable. `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`. The rocks are to the North-East. Let's try to keep the X coordinate the same as `v13` and only move North. A point like `(1.0, -1.0)` for `#o5` might be reachable and allow the arm to be above the targets. If this is still unreachable, the problem might be with the `above` predicate itself being too restrictive for these rock locations, or the robot's arm has very limited reach.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0` predicate. This axiom requires several conditions to be met:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: Both rovers are at their base configurations. These are already true in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: Both rovers' stores are free. These are already true in the initial state.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 must be received.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: A rock of type `v2` (stone) must be analyzed and the analysis received. The rocks of type `v2` are `v1`, `v3`, `v4`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: A rock of type `v6` (soil) must be analyzed and the analysis received. The rocks of type `v6` are `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           
           The problem is extremely constrained, with almost every attempted configuration leading to collisions or unreachable states. This suggests that the geometry of the scene might make the task unachievable with the current robot movement capabilities and the placement of obstacles/objectives, or that the continuous values for the configurations must be very precise.
           
           Let's try one last attempt by carefully re-evaluating each position, considering all previous collision and reachability feedback for `v14` (starting at `v15` = (-1.0, -1.75)) and `v12` (starting at `v13` = (1.0, -1.75)).
           
           **Rover `v14` for imaging and sending images:**
           
           For imaging objectives `v17` and `v18`:
           `v17`: ((-1.848, 1.916), (-1.753, 2.011)) (Far North-West)
           `v18`: ((0.254, 1.903), (0.343, 1.993)) (Far North-East)
           Obstacles: `v22` (X=0.0 wall), `v24` (at X roughly 0.4-0.5, Y roughly 1.0-1.2).
           The previous `#o3` at `(-0.5, 1.5)` was unreachable. The objectives are at high Y values. Given the rover starts at Y=-1.75, moving to Y=1.5 is a significant move north. Let's try a less ambitious Y value for `#o3`, and focus on clearing `v22` and `v24`. Since `v22` is at X=0.0 and `v24` is at X=0.4-0.5, trying a position like `(-0.2, 0.5)` for `#o3` could avoid `v22` (being slightly on the negative X side) and be a more reachable Y coordinate. This might also provide a reasonable view.
           
           For communication with `v9` (lander) from either rover:
           `v9`: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)) (South-West corner)
           Obstacles: `v21` (at X -1.2 to -1.1, Y -2.08 to -1.94), `v23` (at Y=-2.5), `v25` (at X -0.5 to -0.3, Y -1.92 to -1.78).
           The previous `#o0` at `(0.0, -2.2)` was in collision with `v22` (X=0.0 wall). This means the rover's base is too wide for X=0.0. We need to move away from X=0.0. Given `v9` is in the southwest, and `v14` is in the west and `v12` is in the east, a common communication point for both rovers is ideal. Let's try `(-0.8, -2.2)` for `#o0`. This is south of `v21`, `v25`, and `v9`, and away from `v22`.
           
           **Rover `v12` for sampling and sending analysis:**
           
           For sampling rocks `v3` and `v7`:
           `v3`: ((1.486, -1.209), (1.579, -1.116))
           `v7`: ((1.751, -0.804), (1.874, -0.68))
           The previous `#o5` at `(1.0, -1.0)` was unreachable. `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`. The rocks are to the North-East. If `(1.0, -1.0)` is unreachable, it means `v12` cannot move far enough north. Let's try moving `v12` to `(1.0, -1.5)` for `#o5`. This is a smaller step north from `v13` and should be more reachable.
           
           Given the extreme difficulty in finding valid configurations, it's possible that the problem is indeed unachievable. However, I will provide one more plan with the revised configurations.

           Configuration #o0 = (-0.8 -2.2) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-0.8 -2.2) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o5 = (1.0 -1.5) for rover v12 at target v3 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o5 = (1.0 -1.5) for rover v12 at target v7 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The problem is proving exceptionally difficult due to persistent issues with reachability and collisions for all proposed continuous configurations. This suggests either an extremely narrow operating window for the rover, or that some implicit constraints are not being fully captured, or that the goal is simply unachievable with the given environment and valid actions. I have tried several configurations for imaging, communication, and sampling, each time being met with a collision or reachability error.
           
           Given that I have exhausted many plausible options for adjusting the continuous parameters within the problem's stated constraints and without more information about the robot's kinematics or the precise layout of all obstacles beyond their AABBs, I conclude that the goal is likely not achievable from the initial state. The repeated failure to find a collision-free and reachable configuration across multiple attempts points to this conclusion.
