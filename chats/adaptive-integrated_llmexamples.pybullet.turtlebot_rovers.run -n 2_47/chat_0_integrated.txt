           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0` axiom. This axiom requires several conditions to be met, including:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: These are also already true in the initial state.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This means we need to take images of `v17` and `v18` with mode `v11` and then send them to the lander `v9`.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means we need to analyze a rock of type `v2` (stone) and send its analysis.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means we need to analyze a rock of type `v6` (soil) and send its analysis.
           
           Let's break down how to achieve the imaging and analysis goals.
           
           **Imaging Goals:**
           We need `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`. This requires the `take_image` and `send_image` actions.
           - To `take_image`, a rover needs to be calibrated.
           - To `send_image`, the image needs to be `haveimage`.
           
           Both `v12` and `v14` have `imagevisible` predicates for `v17` and `v18` at configuration `#o3` with ray `#o4`. They also both have `comvisible` to `v9` at configuration `#o0` with ray `#o1`. Rover `v10` is onboard both `v12` and `v14`, and supports mode `v11`.
           
           **Analysis Goals:**
           We need `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`. This requires the `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` actions.
           - To `sample_rock`, a rover needs to be above the rock, have a free store, and the rock needs to be graspable (which is implied for sampling).
           - To `send_analysis`, the rock needs to be analyzed by the rover and `comvisible` to the lander.
           
           We have rocks `v4` (type `v2` - stone), `v1` (type `v2` - stone), `v3` (type `v2` - stone), `v5` (type `v6` - soil), `v7` (type `v6` - soil), `v8` (type `v6` - soil).
           
           Let's use `v14` for imaging and `v12` for sampling.
           
           **Strategy:**
           
           1. **Rover `v14` (imaging):**
               - Calibrate the camera (`v10`) for `v17` and `v18` at configuration `#o3` using rover `v14`.
               - Take images of `v17` and `v18` with mode `v11` using camera `v10` at configuration `#o3`.
               - Send the images of `v17` and `v18` with mode `v11` to the lander `v9` at configuration `#o0`.
           
           2. **Rover `v12` (sampling and analysis):**
               - Sample a rock of type `v2` (stone), e.g., `v4`, at configuration `#o5`.
               - Sample a rock of type `v6` (soil), e.g., `v5`, at configuration `#o5`.
               - Send the analysis of `v4` and `v5` to the lander `v9` at configuration `#o0`. Note that sampling two rocks might require dropping one in between if the store is full. However, `v12` has a store `v16` and it is free, so it can sample one rock. The problem does not state a limit on how many rocks can be analyzed, but only on how many can be stored. Since it is not explicitly stated that `v12` cannot sample another rock after analyzing one, we can assume it can. If the robot has a single store, it can only hold one rock at a time. The problem does not specify the capacity of `v16`. Since `free(v12, v16)` is true, `v12` can sample one rock. If it samples another, `full(v12, v16)` will be true. To sample a third, it would need to `drop_rock`. Let's assume for now that it can only sample one rock at a time.
               However, the goal only requires `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`. It does not require `analyzed(rover, rock)`. So, we can sample `v4` (stone) and send its analysis. Then we can drop `v4`, sample `v5` (soil) and send its analysis.
           
           Let's refine the plan for `v12` for sampling and analysis:
           - `v12` is at `v13`. It is above several rocks at `#o5`.
           - Sample rock `v4` (type `v2` - stone) at `#o5`. `free(v12, v16)` is true.
           - Send analysis of `v4` to `v9` at `#o0`.
           - Drop rock `v4` (now `full(v12, v16)` is true after sampling).
           - Sample rock `v5` (type `v6` - soil) at `#o5`. `free(v12, v16)` is true again after dropping.
           - Send analysis of `v5` to `v9` at `#o0`.
           
           Let's check the available actions: only `move` and `drop_rock` are listed as valid instances. This means we cannot use `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis` directly if they are not explicitly listed in the valid action instances.
           
           This is a critical constraint. If only `move` and `drop_rock` instances are available, and the goal requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`, then the goal is unreachable. The given valid action instances are extremely limited. `new-axiom@0()` requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates to be true, but there are no `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` actions available in the 'valid action instances' list. Therefore, the goal cannot be achieved.
           
           The provided list of "valid action instances" only contains `move` and `drop_rock` actions. The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates to be true. These predicates can only be achieved by the `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, respectively. Since there are no `send_image` or `send_analysis` action instances available, nor are there any `take_image`, `calibrate`, or `sample_rock` actions available, it is impossible to satisfy the goal.
