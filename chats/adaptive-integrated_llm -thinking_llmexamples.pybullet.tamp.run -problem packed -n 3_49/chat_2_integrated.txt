User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.211, 0.126), (0.291, 0.206)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.22, 0.41), (0.297, 0.487)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.251, 0.166, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.997, 0.083).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.137, -0.347), (0.213, -0.27)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.259, 0.448, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.053, 0.999).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.175, -0.308, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.672, 0.74).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **The Plan for Object Relocation**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The core challenge is moving three objects (v8, v12, v14) from their current positions on support v11 onto surface v16, using the robot arm v4. Each object has a grasp (#o1) specified, and the robot base is currently at bconf v3. A new base configuration #o3 and trajectory #o4 are also relevant.
           
           My goal is to achieve the `on(object, v16)` condition for each object, which boils down to `supported(object, #o2, v16)` and `atpose(object, #o2)`. Note that `#o2` is the same symbol for all objects, but I have to provide distinct pose values because of the problem requirements.
           
           The plan involves these steps:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  The robot base needs to move from v3 to base configuration #o3. This is a `move_base` action. The cost for this is the distance between v3 and #o3, which I don't know yet.
           2.  **Object 1: v12:** Pick v12 from its current position v13 (using grasp #o1) and place it at the new pose #o2 on v16. I am assuming the Z-height is the same as the current Z with a small offset (0.831) assuming it is placing objects in the same plane as the current objects and the surface height has been accounted for. I'm placing it at x=-0.09, y=0.0.
           3.  **Object 2: v8:**  Pick v8 from its current position v9 (grasp #o1) and place it at the new pose #o2 on v16. I'm placing it at x=0.0, y=0.0, and the same Z as the first.
           4.  **Object 3: v14:** Pick v14 from v15 (grasp #o1) and place it at the new pose #o2 on v16. Again, I'm at z=0.831, x=0.09, y=0.0.
           
           For each `pick` and `place` action, I'm using base configuration #o3 and trajectory #o4 as required by `kin` predicates. The cost of each pick and place is 1.
           
           The problem states "if the plan requires multiple different objects to be placed simultaneously at the same pose starting with '#', then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* object at that pose".  While `#o2` appears in `supported` conditions in the initial state, it's considered new in the `atpose` condition after a `place`. So even though `#o2` is *symbolically* the same for all three, the specific *pose* instances must be different.  I will handle this by providing different x, y, z, and theta values for each object-surface pair in the output. The surface AABB is ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). I need to make the poses fit within this box. I made the x positions -0.09, 0, 0.09, so the objects won't overlap. Since all objects are roughly the same size, they fit without collision.
           
           The poses I'll define are:
           
           -   `(#o2 v12 v16): (-0.09 0.0 0.831 0.0)`
           -   `(#o2 v8 v16): (0.0 0.0 0.831 0.0)`
           -   `(#o2 v14 v16): (0.09 0.0 0.831 0.0)`
           
           The total cost is the base movement (unknown) plus 6 (2 picks, 2 places, 3 objects). I'm assuming the base can get close to the objects to pick and place. There are no unsafe conditions according to the initial state. The plan looks solid.
