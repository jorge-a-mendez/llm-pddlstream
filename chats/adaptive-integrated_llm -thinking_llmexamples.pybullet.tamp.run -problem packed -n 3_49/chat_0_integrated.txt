User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.259, 0.448, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.053, 0.999).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.22, 0.41), (0.297, 0.487)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.175, -0.308, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.672, 0.74).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.251, 0.166, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.997, 0.083).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.137, -0.347), (0.213, -0.27)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.211, 0.126), (0.291, 0.206)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Alright, here's my plan to tackle this object-placement problem.**
           
           I've got three objects, v8, v12, and v14, all resting on v11 in their initial positions. The goal is to get all three of them onto a small surface, v16.  This v16 surface is AABB ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)), so it's a tight squeeze.  The robot's base is fixed at position v3, so all the work has to be done from that spot. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6. Currently, v4 is ataconf v5, and v6 is ataconf v7, both with empty hands.
           
           The problem is that I'm *only* given one action instance: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This seems pretty useless on its own since the base can't move!  The problem description is a bit contradictory here: it says I can only use what's provided, but it also sounds like I need to generate pick and place actions, and trajectories. Based on similar problem setups, I'm assuming that this one `move_base` instance *is* just there as an action to indicate that the base can't move. I'm *allowed* to use it if needed, but not required. And I interpret the problem so that I must synthesize pick and place actions.  I'm interpreting that I have to *instantiate* the `pick` and `place` actions using the provided objects and by finding appropriate continuous parameters to achieve the goals. And I assume the continuous parameters, and trajectories can be generated by a downstream solver.
           
           Therefore, the only way to get these objects onto v16 is to use the robot's arms to pick them up and place them down. So, the core strategy:
           1.  Move v8 onto v16.
           2.  Move v12 onto v16.
           3.  Move v14 onto v16.
           
           For each object, I'll need to `pick` it and then `place` it. Since v16 is relatively small, I need to choose distinct poses on it to avoid collisions.  The initial state uses `#o2` as a pose, and specifies that the objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are `supported` by `v16`. So I'll use `#o2` for the target position on v16, and generate appropriate, distinct, coordinates for it.
           
           Here's the plan:
           1.  **Move v14:** Pick up v14 using arm v4, move it to the robot's base v3, and place it at pose `#o2` on v16.  `#o2` is the target pose and it has to be on v16.
           2.  **Move v12:** Pick up v12 using arm v4, and place it at `#o2` on v16, making sure this target pose is different from v14's.
           3.  **Move v8:** Pick up v8 using arm v4, and place it at `#o2` on v16, again ensuring it doesn't collide with the other objects or itself.
           
           I'm making a simplifying assumption that it's safe to pick and place from the current base location, and the robot's kinematics allow. I'll also assume that `move_base` is not necessary to use.
           
           Since v16 is small, I need to carefully choose the positions for v8, v12, and v14 to avoid collisions when placing them. I will also have to *provide* continuous poses for the objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14` when placed on `v16`. I can't leave this as just the `#o2` parameter; the `#o2` pose must be replaced by *specific* positions on v16 for each object.
           
           So here's how I'll assign the poses:
           -   v14: (0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           -   v12: (-0.05, 0.05, 0.781, 0.0)
           -   v8: (0.05, -0.05, 0.781, 0.0)
           
           I'll put the *bottom* of the three objects, at the same *z* as the original object pose. I'm also going to *assume* all objects

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v14) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #t_place_v14) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v12) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #t_place_v12) , (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v8) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #t_place_v8)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of an Impossible Task**
           
           Okay, so I messed up. The user is right; my previous plan was completely off-base. I totally disregarded the crucial detail: the *only* allowed action is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  That means the robot can *only* sit still!  No picking, no placing, no cleaning, no cooking... nothing but staying put.  I was explicitly told what actions I'm allowed to use, and I completely ignored that.
           
           My goal is to have objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all stacked on `v16`.  Looking at the initial state, it's clear they *are* already stacked, just not on `v16`. They're each at a pose that is supported by `v11`.
           
           To get them onto `v16`, I'd *need* to pick them up, move them, and place them down –  at a minimum.  But, I can't do that.  There are no `pick` or `place` actions available to me!  I am fundamentally constrained to moving the base, from `v3` to `v3`.
           
           Therefore, given the initial state, the goal is completely unattainable with the given action set. The robot is fundamentally incapable of making any progress towards the objective. It is a completely impossible task. I need to report this back as a failure.
