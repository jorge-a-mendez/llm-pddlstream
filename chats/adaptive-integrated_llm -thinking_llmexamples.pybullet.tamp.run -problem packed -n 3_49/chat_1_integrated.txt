User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.211, 0.126), (0.291, 0.206)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.22, 0.41), (0.297, 0.487)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.251, 0.166, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.997, 0.083).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.137, -0.347), (0.213, -0.27)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.259, 0.448, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.053, 0.999).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.175, -0.308, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.672, 0.74).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Finalized Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so here's the plan I've come up with. The goal is straightforward: get three objects (v8, v12, and v14) currently on surface v11, onto surface v16.  I've analyzed the initial state and the available actions, and here's the breakdown of what I'm going to do:
           
           1.  **Preparation**: The robot's base is already in the right position (v3).  No base movement needed since the `kin` facts are defined for base configuration `v3`. The available `move_base` action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` is a no-op, though it helps the system state satisfy `canmove()`.
           2.  **Object Placement Strategy:**  The key is the `on` predicate, which requires that each object be *supported* on v16. This means finding a stable, collision-free pose (#o2) for each object on the surface.  Since the initial state provides the geometry (AABBs) of the objects and the target surface, I need to come up with three distinct (x, y) coordinates for placement within the bounds of v16, ensuring that the AABBs of the objects don't overlap.
           3.  **Specific Poses:** I'm going to use a linear placement strategy to avoid any potential collisions. The `z` coordinate will be 0.781 for each object based on the initial poses. Since the AABB is global coordinates at its current pose, I can use the AABB and object dimensions to ensure the whole object fits within the target AABB:
               *   **v12:** Placement Pose: (-0.09, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0).  The AABB will be located at roughly [-0.128, -0.052] in X, [-0.0385, 0.0385] in Y.
               *   **v8:** Placement Pose: (-0.002, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0).  The AABB will be located at roughly [-0.042, 0.038] in X, [-0.04, 0.04] in Y.
               *   **v14:** Placement Pose: (0.0865, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0).  The AABB will be located at roughly [0.048, 0.125] in X, [-0.0385, 0.0385] in Y.
           4.  **Action Sequence**: With the poses chosen, here are the detailed action steps:
           
               *   **Pick & Place v12:** Pick v12 from its current pose (v13) using arm v4, grasp #o1, trajectory #o4. Place v12 onto pose #o2 using arm v4 and trajectory #o4.  #o2 will have coordinates (-0.09, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0).
               *   **Pick & Place v8:** Pick v8 from its current pose (v9) using arm v4, grasp #o1, trajectory #o4. Place v8 onto pose #o2 using arm v4 and trajectory #o4.  #o2 will have coordinates (-0.002, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0).
               *   **Pick & Place v14:** Pick v14 from its current pose (v15) using arm v4, grasp #o1, trajectory #o4. Place v14 onto pose #o2 using arm v4 and trajectory #o4. #o2 will have coordinates (0.0865, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0).
           
           This strategy keeps everything clean and ensures that the goal is achieved: all three objects are *on* surface v16, which is what the plan demanded. Each `pick` action makes `handempty(v4)` and `canmove()` true, each `place` also makes `canmove()` true, and the action order makes sure that after 3 `place` actions, the final state satisfies the goal.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **A Dead End: This Plan is Fundamentally Flawed**
           
           Okay, so the user's critique is clear: my previous plan was using actions I'm explicitly *not* allowed to use.  I need to stick to the rulebook, and the only play I'm given is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  That's it.  One move.
           
           Let's dissect this.  The effects of that move are, essentially, "do nothing" in terms of what I need. It just keeps the `atbconf` of `v3` where it is, and removes and immediately re-adds the `canmove()` predicate.  Useless.
           
           Here's the rub: the ultimate goal requires placing things *on* other things. That means I need `pick` and `place` actions to manipulate objects and get them into the right configurations (using `supported`, `atpose`, etc. predicates that only come with those actions).  But those aren't allowed!  I checked, and they're definitely not in the approved actions list.
           
           Given *only* `move_base`, I'm stuck. I can't change any object's position, I can't move the arm, I can't get anything into the "on" configuration that the goal demands. The puzzle's pieces simply don't fit.  It's an unsolvable problem with the given constraint. I need a different set of actions or a re-evaluation of the goal.
