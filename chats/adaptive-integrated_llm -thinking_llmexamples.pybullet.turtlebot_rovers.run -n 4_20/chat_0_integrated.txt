           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Infeasibility Analysis: The Goal is Unattainable**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate target is `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunctive goal involving `atconf`, `free`, `receivedimage`, `receivedanalysis`, and some type predicates. Examining the initial state, I see that I already satisfy the `atconf` and `free` conditions. That's a good start. However, the crux of the matter lies in achieving the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. To do so requires a deeper dive into the actions I have at my disposal.
           
           I quickly realize that to even *begin* the image and analysis procedures, actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` are essential. These actions are conspicuously absent from the list of permitted actions. *This is a problem*.
           
           My analysis proceeds: I map out the preconditions required for each of those unavailable actions. Each one hinges on intermediate states that I *cannot generate* with the given tools. The available actions – `move` and `drop_rock` – cannot possibly lead to the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates being true. Even if I could *use* them, the system does not give me the means to change state beyond `atconf` and `free`.
           
           Furthermore, a careful review of the problem constraints reinforces the limitations.  I must follow the rule: "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is false." It's black and white. Given this, since neither `receivedimage` nor `receivedanalysis` are present in the initial state, they are *unconditionally false*, which makes achieving my goal impossible.
           
           Therefore, given the constraints on available actions and the initial state, I have to conclude: the target state defined by `new-axiom@0()` is *unachievable*. It's a dead end. I have no tools to obtain the images and analysis needed.
