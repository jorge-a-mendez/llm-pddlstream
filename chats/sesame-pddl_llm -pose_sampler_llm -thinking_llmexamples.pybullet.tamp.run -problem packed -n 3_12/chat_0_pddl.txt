(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable locations to place object ID 4, a square with sides of approximately 0.088, onto surface 0, which is a square region centered at the origin with corners at (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135).  A placement is represented as (surf_idx, theta, x, y), where surf_idx is always 0 in this case, theta is the rotation, and (x, y) is the center of the object's AABB.  The object must stay fully within the surface.
           
           I've determined that the key is understanding how the object's bounding box changes with rotation. Since it's a square, the effective half-width (and half-height) of its bounding box when rotated depends on the angle (theta).  Specifically, the half-width is calculated using the formula: s/2 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))), where 's' is the side length.
           
           To ensure the object remains fully within the surface, I need to limit its center.  The object's center must be within a rectangle smaller than the surface, where the amount subtracted from each side depends on the bounding box's dimensions which are dictated by theta.
           
           Since the maximum bounding box occurs at rotations where *theta* is a multiple of *pi/4*, I will concentrate on rotations that offer the most variance by calculating bounding box dimensions.  In order to get 50 solutions, I'm going to set up 25 values each.  For *theta* = 0, the maximum coordinate, I've calculated the x and y coordinate range: [-0.09105308683770157, 0.09105308683770157]. For *theta* = *pi/8*, I get coordinates within  [-0.07759558307865409, 0.07759558307865409]. I then generate a 5x5 grid of (x, y) coordinates for each angle to ensure complete coverage within the allowed space.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I'm dealing with the placement of a new object, ID 5, on the existing surface 0.  I've got the feedback about the successful placement of object 4 in the past, but since it's not relevant *this* time (unless explicitly told otherwise), I'm just focusing on ID 5.
           
           First, I've defined the object's dimensions and the surface boundaries. The object is nearly square, with some minor rectangularity. I've calculated the half-dimensions and the surface half-width/height.  To ensure the object remains within the surface, I need to account for its rotation.  The bounding box dimensions change with rotation, so I'll need to adjust my placement bounds accordingly.
           
           I will be placing the object and calculating placements based on two rotations which I will divide the placements up by: 25 placements at 0 degrees, and 25 at pi/4 radians. Given this object is very nearly square, it is better to have these rotation angles for simplicity in the calculation.
           
           I have already double-checked my calculations, to ensure that the math on the half-dimensions is valid and that the rotations in the calculation are appropriate.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID: 6 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID: 6 on surface 0, which is defined as a rectangle centered at (0,0) with dimensions `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  That means the surface's half-dimensions are `W = H = 0.135`.
           
           Object 6 is essentially a square with `size_x = size_y = 0.0981614597921879...`.  Thus, the half-extents are  `hx = hy = 0.049080729896...`.  Since there aren't any obstacles to avoid, I can focus on a straightforward grid-based placement strategy.
           
           I'll use a few representative rotation angles and generate a grid of positions for each. The key is to calculate the bounding box based on rotation.  For a rotated object at angle `theta`, the half-extents of the axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) are:
           
           `B_x(theta) = hx * abs(cos(theta)) + hy * abs(sin(theta))`
           `B_y(theta) = hx * abs(sin(theta)) + hy * abs(cos(theta))`
           
           The center `(x, y)` of the object must fall within the range:
           `-W + B_x(theta) <= x <= W - B_x(theta)`
           `-H + B_y(theta) <= y <= H - B_y(theta)`
           
           Since `hx` and `hy` are so close (due to the square nature of the object), I'll approximate with `h = (hx+hy)/2 = 0.049080729896...` and so `B(theta) = h * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))` for `B_x` and `B_y`.
           
           Let's do this:
           
           1.  **Theta = 0:**
               `B_x(0) = hx = 0.049080729896...`
               `B_y(0) = hy = 0.049080729896...`
               The maximum x/y coordinates are `0.135 - 0.0490... = 0.085919...`. I'll use a 5x5 grid spanning the range `-0.085919...` to `0.085919...` for both x and y.  This gives me 25 placements.
           
           2.  **Theta = pi/4 (0.785398...) :**
               Using the fact that `cos(pi/4) = sin(pi/4)`, I can calculate that `B_x(pi/4) = B_y(pi/4) =  0.069411...`
               The max x/y coordinates are `0.135 - 0.0694... = 0.065588...`.  I'll use a 5x5 grid spanning `-0.065588...` to `0.065588...` for both x and y, giving me another 25 placements, for a total of 50.
           
           That should be a good set of placements for object ID: 6.
