           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           Atom aconf(v4, v5)

           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom pose(v15, v16)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v14)
           Atom type(v12, v17)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes three graspable objects, `v15`, `v8`, and `v12`, and two arms, `v6` and `v4`, which are both handempty. `v15` is currently at `v16` supported by `v11`. `v8` is at `v9` supported by `v11`. `v12` is at `v13` supported by `v14`. There are also potential poses for these objects on `v10` and `v18`. The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true for some `?green`. From the initial state, we know `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`. Therefore, we need to achieve `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)`.
           `on(v8, v18)` means `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)`. We already have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. So we need to place `v8` at pose `#o2`.
           `on(v12, v18)` means `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)`. We already have `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. So we need to place `v12` at pose `#o2`.
           
           However, the only action available is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, which does not change the state of objects or their positions, therefore, it's impossible to achieve the goal given the available actions.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. We have `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`. So we need to place either `v8` or `v12` on `v18`. This would require a `pick` and `place` action. However, the only available action is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, which only moves the base from `v3` to `v3` using trajectory `#o0`. This action does not change the state of any object's pose or whether it's being held, and thus cannot satisfy the goal. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
