(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 5**
           
           My primary goal is to generate 50 stable placements for the object on the given surface. The surface is a square of size 0.27 x 0.27 meters, centered at the origin. The object, with dimensions very close to a square (approximately 0.0986 x 0.0986 meters), needs to be fully contained within the surface's boundaries for a stable placement.
           
           To achieve this, I calculate the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) dimensions for different rotations (`theta`). Since the object is almost square, I focused on two representative orientations: `theta = 0` (object aligned with the world axes) and `theta = pi/4` (object rotated by 45 degrees, which often represents the maximum effective size).
           
           For each rotation, I determine the valid `x` and `y` ranges where the object's center can be placed while ensuring it remains fully within the surface. Using these valid ranges, I then generate a 5x5 grid of placement coordinates `(x, y)` for each of the two angles. This results in 25 placements for each angle, totalling 50 stable placements. I have verified that 50 stable placements are generated, so the code looks complete.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placements for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with finding 50 stable placements for object ID 6 on surface 0, avoiding collisions with object ID 5, which is already fixed in place.  Object 6 has dimensions `(0.08946779607245439, 0.08946779607245436)` and needs to fit on a surface that's `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           I started by establishing the available space for object 6, taking into account its size and the surface boundaries. Then, I had to consider the existing placement of Object 5 which is snug in the bottom-left corner of the surface with an AABB of `((-0.135, -0.135), (-0.03636640385584958, -0.03636640385584954))`.
           
           To avoid collisions, I needed to identify regions on the surface where Object 6 could be placed without overlapping Object 5. I calculated the valid center ranges for `theta = 0.0` and `theta = pi/4`.  Using the non-overlap conditions `x - W/2 >= obj5_max_x` OR `y - H/2 >= obj5_max_y`, I determined areas where a placement would be safe, either to the right of Object 5 or above it.
           
           To generate a set of candidate placements, I considered a 7x7 grid for the `theta=0` orientations and 6x6 grid for `theta=pi/4`. These grid values cover the overall valid `x` and `y` range while considering valid positions on each surface. By selecting only positions that are non-colliding, I get enough placements. After running the collision checks, I now have 33 valid placements for `theta = 0.0` and 24 valid placements for `theta = pi/4`, which gives 57 placements in total.
           I will take the first 50.

(Thoughts: **My task is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 4 on surface 0, making sure it doesn't collide with objects ID 5 and ID 6, which are already placed.**
           
           Surface 0 is a rectangular area defined by the coordinates `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I have the dimensions and placement data (including AABB coordinates) for both existing objects:
           
           *   **Object 5:** Located at approximately `(-0.086, -0.086)` with a width and height of approximately `0.099`. Its AABB is `((-0.135, -0.135), (-0.036, -0.036))`.
           *   **Object 6:** Located at approximately `(-0.090, 0.0)` with a width and height of approximately `0.089`. Its AABB is `((-0.135, -0.045), (-0.045, 0.045))`.
           
           Object 4 has dimensions of approximately `0.097`.
           
           The critical part is the collision check. I need to avoid overlap between object 4's AABB and the AABBs of objects 5 and 6. To achieve this, I will test for collision in each of the candidate placements. I can check collision with a function that takes two AABBs and determines overlap using the following conditions:
           
           *   The function returns `False` if no overlap is detected and True if there is.
           
           To generate the placements, I plan to create a grid of points over surface 0, then shift it slightly to ensure the generated objects do not overlap.
           For a reliable search, I am using different orientations `theta` = `0.0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, pi/2`, and create a 7x7 grid, i.e., I can sample at 49 points for each of the rotations. This will give me a sufficient number of start points to locate at least 50 valid object positions.
           
           To optimize the search, I am using the concept that object 5 covers the bottom-left of the available space, and object 6 is approximately in the middle-left of the available space, therefore, I will prioritize placements on the right and above these two objects.

(Thoughts: **Scene Understanding and Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the situation: I've got a request to find 50 stable placements for "Object 7" on "Surface 0." The tricky part is avoiding collisions with objects already on the surface: "Object 5," "Object 6," and "Object 4." I need to ensure that Object 7 stays entirely within the boundaries of Surface 0.
           
           **Breaking Down the Problem:**
           
           1.  **Understand the Scene:** I've carefully analyzed the properties of Surface 0 and the existing objects, including their dimensions and bounding box (AABB) information. I've computed the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the surface, as well as the bounding boxes for the existing objects.
           
           2.  **Obstacle Detection:** I've noted the approximate positions of the existing objects. I see there's a small overlap between Object 5 and Object 6, which should be okay since they are already successfully placed. Object 4 is placed towards the bottom middle, which is well below Object 6 on the left.
           
           3.  **Placement Strategy:** My plan is to explore different orientations for Object 7, specifically two angles: 0 degrees and 45 degrees. Then, I'll calculate the valid placement zones within Surface 0.
           
           4.  **Collision Avoidance:** To find valid positions, I'll generate a grid of potential center points for Object 7. For each grid point, I'll calculate Object 7's AABB (based on its orientation) and then check for overlap with each of the existing objects' AABBs.
           
           5.  **AABB Overlap Condition:** To check for a valid placement, I need to ensure that all of the collision conditions are met. I have to make sure that Object 7 does not overlap with existing objects, which means checking for overlap in the x and y axes for all objects.
           
           6.  **Iteration:** I'll run this process, iterating through different `(x_c, y_c)` placements and angles, to obtain 50 unique valid positions for Object 7.
           
           **Calculations & Specifics:**
           
           For `theta = 0.0`: The object is perfectly aligned with the grid lines. I'll sample the `(x_c, y_c)` values using grid sampling and check for non-overlapping conditions. For `theta = pi/4`: This will change the effective dimensions of object 7 and I will need to generate another set of grid sample points.
           
           I've already begun calculating the necessary bounds and intermediate values. I've successfully calculated the grid sample points, so I'm well on my way. I'll just need to finish the collision checks, and I'll be good to go.
