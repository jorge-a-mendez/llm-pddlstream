           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.342, 0.094, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.047, 0.999).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((3.353, -1.125), (4.599, 0.037)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.38, 0.056), (-4.303, 0.133)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Achieving the Goal: `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of how I'm going to achieve this `new-axiom@0()` goal. My initial understanding, based on the provided axioms, is that this goal requires me to satisfy two conditions:  `on(?o, v18)` and `type(?o, v17)`.
           
           The crucial clue comes from my initial state: I already have `type(v12, v17)`.  This tells me that the object `?o` in the goal must be `v12`. Therefore, my primary objective is to make `v12` be "on" the object `v18`.
           
           Now, according to the `on` axiom, "being on" translates to two more specific requirements: (1) `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and (2) `atpose(v12, ?p)`.  I notice that my initial state gives me `supported(v12, #p1, v18)`. This `supported` fact directly helps in satisfying the first condition. Because `v12` is already supported by something, that would be `#p1`. So, it follows that the primary task for me to achieve the goal is to make sure `v12` has pose `#p1`. Therefore, the simplified goal is to make `atpose(v12, #p1)` true.
           
           Based on the current state, `v12` has a pose called `v13`. I will take the action of `move_base`. Then, I'll `pick` the object up and the plan will be to put the object down by a `place` action. These will make the necessary changes to achieve the goal.
           
           My approach is:
           1.  **Move to the picking location:** Before I can pick something, I will need to be at the correct position and orientation. I will use `move_base(v3, #q2, #t5)`. Then, `atbconf(#q2)` is satisfied.
           2.  **Pick up the object:** I will execute `pick(v4, v12, v13, #g1, #q2, #t4)` to pick up the object I'm supposed to place, while I'm in the right configuration. Then, `atgrasp(v4, v12, #g1)` is satisfied.
           3.  **Move to the placing location:** I must now navigate to the placement zone. I will use `move_base(#q2, #q3, #o0)`. Then, `atbconf(#q3)` is satisfied.
           4.  **Place the object:** I will put the object down where it needs to be with `place(v4, v12, #p1, #g1, #q3, #t6)`. Then, the goal of `atpose(v12, #p1)` is achieved.
           
           I need to make an assumption about the safety of my planned actions.  I'm going to have to assume that my trajectories (#t4, #t5, #t6, #o0) are collision-free and that the configurations #q2, #q3, and base locations are safe for the task.
           
           **Continuous Parameter: `#p1`**
           
           Finally, I need to provide a continuous value for `#p1`. This value represents the pose of object `v12` such that `v12` is on `v18`. From the object's AABB and the surface's AABB, as an expert in the field, I know the optimal location is near the center, and the height of placing the object should be around 0.8, due to my initial state in the problem. I will set the coordinates as (4.5, -0.3, 0.801, 0.0).
           
           With this plan and the specific pose, I'm confident that the objective can be satisfied.
