           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **A Strategic Plan to Achieve the New Axiom**
           
           My primary objective is to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom requires that an object of type `v17` is *on* surface `v18`. I immediately identify the object `v8` as being of type `v17` and thus focus on getting `v8` onto `v18`.
           
           Examining the problem state, I note that `v8` can be *supported* on surface `v18` at pose `#o2`. I interpret this as a cue to place `v8` at `#o2`. The initial state gives me a clue that `v8` is currently at pose `v9`.
           
           Therefore, my plan crystallizes into the following steps: first, I need to use the `move_base` action to move the robot base from position `v3` to `#o3`. Then, I will execute the `pick` action to grasp `v8` from its current pose `v9` with arm `v4`. Next, I will place the object `v8` on the target surface `v18` at pose `#o2`. The `place` action ensures that `v8` is no longer supported on `v9` but now on `v18` and in a collision-free and stable pose.
           
           To execute this plan, I have to ensure certain preconditions are satisfied. Importantly, `atbconf(#o3)` needs to be true for the robot to pick `v8`, and also I need a safe placement of `#o2`. This involves considering collision-free conditions and stable placements. I also need to ensure that no unsafe trajectories or unsafe approaches occur.  I then confirm that the necessary kinesthetic relationships exist to allow the pick and place, and confirm a base motion from `v3` to `#o3`.
           
           Furthermore, I understand that I must provide specific numerical values for any poses indicated by `#` symbols in my plan. In this case, that's `#o2`.  I analyze the geometry of the scene to identify a feasible pose for `v8` on `v18`.  `v18` has the AABB coordinates `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))` and I can reason that if `v8` is placed at the center of `v18` `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`, it satisfies all the relevant criteria. This placement is stable and ensures no collisions and satisfies my requirements for a solution.
           
           Finally, after the execution of the move-pick-place actions, the plan will result in a configuration that satisfies `new-axiom@0()` (which requires `on(v8, v18)`). I conclude that this plan is optimal, requiring a minimal set of moves (pick and place, move base) that satisfy the precondition conditions I have analyzed.
