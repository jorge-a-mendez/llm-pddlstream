           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm dealing with. My objective is to create a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()` from the provided initial state.  I start by dissecting the definition of `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom requires several conditions to be met simultaneously:  rovers in certain configurations, specific image transmissions, rock and soil analysis, and so on.
           
           The first step is checking whether the initial state satisfies these conditions.  A few are immediately met: the rovers' initial configurations and their "free" state. But, crucially, the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` conditions are *not* met. These are the stumbling blocks.
           
           **Identifying the Required Actions**
           
           To satisfy the unsatisfied conditions, I need to figure out which actions can achieve them.  I note that  `receivedimage(?o, ?m)` can be accomplished via `send_image`.   Conversely, `receivedanalysis(?r)` is met using the `send_analysis` action. To get `send_image` and `send_analysis` to work, I need supporting actions like `take_image`, `sample_rock` and `calibrate`.
           
           **Analyzing the Initial State and Actions**
           
           Now, I look at the initial state to get the specifics.  I've got two rovers (v12 and v14), a camera (v10) that both rovers can apparently use, several potential "objectives" for imaging, and rocks and soil types available for analysis.  Crucially, I also identify which rover is above which rock/soil using the `above` predicate, since the precondition to use the action `sample_rock` to analyze it requires this.
           
           **The Crucial Constraint: Limited Actions**
           
           Here's the problem: I only have four valid action instances, those of `move` and `drop_rock`. Neither can change the truth value of the problematic sub-goals.
           
           **Re-Evaluating the Goal and Unreachability**
           
           I have to adjust my approach. The conjunctive goal definition of  `new-axiom@0()` demands that every sub-goal is met. Since the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` cannot be achieved by the list of actions provided, the entire goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable.
           
           **Final Conclusion: Goal Unachievable**
           
           My analysis indicates that the given goal `new-axiom@0()` is not achievable, because the required actions to achieve the subgoals of that definition are not allowed by the list of valid action instances provided. Specifically, actions related to image acquisition, transmission, and analysis are missing. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
