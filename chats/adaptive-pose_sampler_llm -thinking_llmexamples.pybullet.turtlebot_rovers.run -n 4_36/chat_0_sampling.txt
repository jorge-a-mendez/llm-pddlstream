User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Robot Base Placement Strategy for Target Point (0.5, 0.5)**
           
           Alright, here's the game plan for finding three suitable base positions for the robot, keeping in mind the target at (0.5, 0.5) and the constraints:
           
           1.  **Environment Analysis:**  I've thoroughly dissected the scene based on the provided AABBs (axis-aligned bounding boxes). The key observations are the room's boundaries (AABB 0-4), the central partition at x=0 (AABB 5), and the smaller obstacles scattered around.  The central partition is the major player, practically dividing the space.
           2.  **Target and Range:** The primary rule is that the robot's base must be within a maximum distance of 2 units from the target point.
           3.  **Collision Avoidance and Line-of-Sight:**  I'm focused on preventing the robot from colliding with any of the fixed obstacles. More importantly, I need to ensure a clear line of sight to the target.  The central partition is the most obvious line-of-sight blocker.
           4.  **Position Selection:** I aim for a variety of robot locations. They are based on a radius less than 2, keeping the positions within the environment boundaries [-2.5, 2.5].
           
           **The Candidate Positions:**
           
           1.  **(2.0, 0.5):** This position places the robot to the east of the target. It's a distance of 1.5 units, so within the range. The line-of-sight check is clear, no small obstacles are in the way.
           2.  **(0.5, -1.0):** This places the robot to the south of the target. It is also 1.5 units away. It, too, is free of obstacles, ensuring line-of-sight.
           3.  **(0.1, 1.5):** This position is chosen to the right of the central partition, but very close to it. This approach provides a viable line-of-sight, and a nice diversity.  The distance is about 1.07.
           
           These three positions should satisfy the requirements.
