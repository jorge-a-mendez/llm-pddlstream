(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           I've been tasked with generating 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 6, dimensions approximately 0.096 x 0.096) on a single square surface (defined by (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135)). My goal is to determine the appropriate `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)` values for each placement.
           
           Since the object is a square, its bounding box size is consistent regardless of rotation.  Stability requires the object's Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) to be fully contained within the surface's AABB.  I've calculated the valid x and y ranges for the object's center to ensure this, taking into account the object's half-dimension (approximately 0.048). The valid ranges for both x and y are [-0.0869, 0.0869].
           
           To achieve a diverse set of placements, I'll vary both the x and y coordinates and the rotation angle (theta). I've devised a grid-based approach. I will pick 5 positions in each dimension (x and y), within the valid range. Then I'll use 2 `theta` values. This will give me a total of 50 combinations (5x5x2 = 50). This should provide adequate coverage of the surface and give a reasonable spread.
           
           The code generates the 50 placements as required.  Since I'm working with a square, rotation doesn't change the object's containment requirements. I will set the `theta` values as `0` and `pi/2`. I am ensuring that the object is within the boundary with the chosen range of x and y values.
           
           With this approach, I can efficiently and accurately generate the 50 placements. No collision detection is required at this stage as there are no previous object placements. I am satisfied with this approach.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Object Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a successful placement for object 6, and now I need to figure out where to put object 4 without it running into object 6.  Object 6 is square-ish, placed at `(surf_idx=0, theta=0.0, x=-0.08690995825275724, y=-0.08690995825275724)` which means it's snug in the bottom left corner of the surface.
           
           I've got the object 4 dimensions (a rectangle) and the surface dimensions. I’ve defined the region for placement on surface 0, taking into account the object size, and ensuring the whole object remains within surface limits at any given rotation `theta`. I also have to use the given half dimensions to define placement constraints, and now to avoid collisions, I'll use axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABB) for quick collision checks.
           
           To avoid collision, it's pretty straightforward. Using the AABBs for each object, I need to prevent overlap between object 6 and object 4's bounding boxes at any rotation `theta`. For the rotation calculation I want to avoid the region where object 6 is already placed, `[(-0.135, -0.135), (-0.038819916505514485, -0.038819916505514485)]`.
           
           I’ve defined a collision-free region, or more accurately, the forbidden region. Using the thresholds, I can identify those placements that result in an AABB overlap.
           
           I’m going to systematically generate a grid of potential placements, making sure to avoid the collision zones I calculated. I've designed a set of coordinates that I know should not collide. I'm taking the non-colliding coordinates and generating the desired number of placements (50). The generation strategy includes considering all valid (x,y) positions and a fixed number of orientations and filtering out coordinates that overlap object 6. This way I will arrive at a selection of validated positions.

(Thoughts: **Initial Situation and Constraints**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable locations for a new object (ID 5) on surface 0. Two existing objects, ID 6 and ID 4, are already placed, and I need to avoid collisions with them.
           
           **Understanding the Scene and the Goal**
           
           Surface 0 is defined by the coordinates (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). The dimensions of the new object (ID 5) are 0.07223860259762932 x 0.07223860259762938, almost a square.  This limits where it can go. I need to figure out where to place the object without hitting any other objects, I'm thinking I'll try it at 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, and 315 degrees of rotation.
           
           **Collision Detection and Constraints**
           
           I need to calculate the bounding boxes for both existing objects.
           
           Object 6's AABB: [-0.135, -0.135) to (-0.0388, -0.0388)
           Object 4's AABB: [-0.135, -0.0205) to (-0.0367, 0.0777)
           
           I will generate x and y coordinates for the object, and test if they collide.
           
           **Strategy Development and Optimization**
           
           I determined some of the general ranges.
           The new object's half-dimensions (`h5x`, `h5y`) are approximately 0.036119.
           I have a general allowed range, based on surface geometry and size of object.
           
           **Finding Candidate Placement Locations**
           
           I can narrow it down to 20x20.
           
           **Valid Placement Regions**
           A place is VALID IF it's on surface 0 AND NOT (collides_o6 OR collides_o4).
           Object coordinates will be generated, and then tested for collision.
           
           **Initial Validation**
           Let's iterate through `x` from -0.083 to 0.083.
           Then, all rotations will be tested, with the existing objects' bounding boxes.
           I think I can find 50 placements.
