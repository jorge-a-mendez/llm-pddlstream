User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point is (0.0, 0.0). The scene is enclosed by walls at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5. There's also a central wall at x = 0. There are several smaller rectangular obstacles throughout the environment. Given the target is at (0,0), and the max range is 2, I need to find positions within a circle of radius 2 centered at (0,0). I will avoid the central wall at x=0. Since the walls are at +/- 2.5, I need to make sure I'm not placing the robot too close to them, especially given the range limit.
           
           Positions:
           (1.5 0.0)
           (-1.5 0.0)
           (0.0 1.5)
