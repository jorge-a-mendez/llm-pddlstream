           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis: An Unreachable Goal in the Rovers Domain**
           
           I've been tasked with finding a plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain. After carefully examining the axiom and breaking down its components, I've come to a critical conclusion: this goal is *unreachable* given the provided initial state and allowed actions.
           
           The axiom requires satisfying several conditions, including receiving images and analyses. To achieve these, I need the rovers to take images, analyze samples, and communicate the results to the lander. However, a crucial constraint arises from the `move` actions. There are only two `move` actions given, both of which are essentially no-ops. They allow a rover to "move" from its current configuration to the same configuration, which is equivalent to not moving.
           
           To take images, the rovers need to be at configuration `#o3`. To communicate and analyze, they need to be at `#o0`. To sample rocks, the rovers need to be at `#o5`. But with the available "move" actions, the rovers are locked in their initial configurations, v13 and v15, and can never reach these necessary configurations.
           
           Since the rovers cannot reach the required configurations, they cannot calibrate their cameras, take images, analyze samples, or send analyses to the lander. Consequently, I can never satisfy the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates required by the goal.
           
           Therefore, despite the apparent simplicity of the goal, the limitations imposed by the `move` actions render it impossible to achieve. The current state and actions do not facilitate the necessary transitions, rendering the goal unreachable.
