           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:

           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).

           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning for the Plan**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with getting these four objects, `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`, all onto `v18`.  Easy enough, right?  The first thing I did was look at the starting situation: everything is on `v11`.  My plan needs to involve moving each object from `v11` (where they're currently supported) to `v18`.  
           
           Since the rulebook is defining `on(?o, ?r)` as `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`, I know I'll have to consider both of these criteria to meet the requirements for my plan.
           
           From the start, the `kin` and `supported` facts point to placing these objects on `v18` using a common pose, `#o2`.  This seems unusual because I'm used to unique poses per object.  However, the instructions specifically say I can't just use one `#o2` for all the objects—I have to generate a distinct continuous value (i.e., coordinate). So I will do so.
           
           My thought process is this: I need a robot action sequence that will pick up each object and place it on `v18` at distinct poses. I'll need to move the robot to a base configuration (`#o3`) and then execute a `pick` and a `place` for each object. The preconditions for these actions dictate my plan: `kin` facts, `atpose`, and importantly, `handempty`. So, I'll need to use `move_base` to get to the base, and use `handempty` as the start condition. I should also note that `basemotion` facts indicate the robot can move to and from the configuration `#o3`.
           
           I then analyzed the constraints, like the bounding boxes of `v18` and the objects. This is important to ensure that I'm not placing them in an unsafe approach. I figured a basic 2x2 grid will do and generated the coordinates for that based on the table's and objects' sizes. The height will be at 0.781 (given by existing poses `v9, v13, v15, v17`) for all objects on `v18`.
           
           So, the whole plan looks something like this: move to `#o3`, pick `v8` from its initial pose and place it at a specific pose on `v18`.  Then do the same for `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`. Since I'm making sure to use `place` on a `v18` pose, this means it will automatically satisfy the `atpose` condition to satisfy the `on` predicate for the problem! And, it also uses distinct coordinates for #o2, which satisfies the instruction.
           
           Finally, a quick review of all the preconditions confirmed the plan's validity, and since I'm placing objects at safe locations on a table, I don't see any collision concerns. The cost associated with the motion is just the initial move to base plus 4 picks and 4 places.
           
           Done.
