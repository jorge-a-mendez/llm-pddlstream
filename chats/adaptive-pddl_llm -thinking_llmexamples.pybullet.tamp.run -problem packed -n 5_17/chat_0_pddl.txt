           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v20)
               Atom on(v12, v20)
               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unachievable Goal: No Available Pick or Place Actions**
           
           Okay, here's the situation as I see it. My primary objective is to get these five objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, `v18`) from their current positions on `v11` to the target location on `v20`. The goal explicitly requires that they all be `on(..., v20)`.  This means I need to physically move these objects.
           
           Looking at the tools at my disposal, I see I've got a single action instance: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This *only* moves the base configuration, and it doesn't even actually change the configuration since it goes from `v3` to `v3`. It's essentially a no-op as far as achieving the goal is concerned.
           
           To achieve the goal, I *need* to be able to use `pick` and `place` actions. I understand the general definitions of these actions, with their preconditions like `handempty`, `atpose`, `supported` and kinematics, etc. I also see that kinemantic data exists in the initial state with those `#o` notations. But there are *no* explicitly provided *instances* of these actions. The instructions are very clear: I'm only allowed to use the *provided* action instances.
           
           Essentially, I'm constrained by the action instances I'm allowed to use. It's like I have a robot arm with no gripper. I *know* how to pick something up in theory, but I can't actually *do* it.
           
           The rules are quite explicit: "You are only allowed to use the provided actions". And the only provided action is useless for this task. The preconditions exist but are insufficient to make actions without instances.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unachievable given the limitations. I have no way to manipulate the objects.
