(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for a Square Object on a Square Surface**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 4) on a square surface (surface 0).  The object's dimensions are roughly 0.09155 units on each side, and the surface spans from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  A stable placement means the object is fully contained within the surface.  Since it's a square, its bounding box remains the same regardless of its rotation.  The challenge lies in finding diverse positions and rotations.
           
           First, I need to determine the valid center coordinates (x, y) for the object.  I've calculated that the center must lie within a smaller square defined by  approximately [-0.089, 0.089]. This is because the object's half-size (0.04577588397438692)  must be considered for full containment.
           
           To achieve 50 placements, I'll create a 7x7 grid of center coordinates within these bounds.  This gives me 49 unique (x, y) locations.  Then, I'll vary the rotation angle (theta) at each location.  I'll use 32 distinct angles, spaced at pi/16 intervals. The strategy is to cycle through these angles for each grid point, thus ensuring a diverse set of orientations. This cycling is designed to generate 49 unique placements. For the 50th placement, I'll select the center (0,0) location and a different angle for that specific location.
           
           The final output will be a list of tuples, each in the format (surface index, theta, x, y), representing a stable placement.  I'm confident this method will yield 50 distinct and stable configurations, covering the desired range of positions and orientations for the square object.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Placement Strategy for Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've got this new object, ID 5, that I need to place on the same surface where object ID 4 was successfully placed.  The key is to avoid any collisions with object 4, which is a square placed in the bottom-left corner. I know the successful placement coordinates of object 4, its dimensions (also a square), and therefore its AABB, which occupies from (-0.135, -0.135) to (-0.04344823205122616, -0.04344823205122616).
           
           Object 5 is also a square, nearly, and has dimensions (0.07046665258100288, 0.07046665258100293), which translate to a half-side of ~0.035233. The surface itself has bounds of (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  
           
           My goal is to find 50 valid placements for object 5, ensuring that its center stays within the surface bounds and doesn't intersect with the AABB of object 4.  To achieve this, I'm going to create a 10x10 grid on the available space, and filter the center coordinates based on collision avoidance.
           
           I'll calculate the 'forbidden' region for the center of object 5, i.e., the region that overlaps with object 4, including padding for object 5's size. That forbidden zone, after some calculations, effectively creates an 'L' shape of valid placement space that doesn't overlap with the original object, and I need to select points that are both valid in terms of surface bounds, and outside of that 'L' (x must be greater than -0.008 or y greater than -0.008.
           
           Then I will create the grid points and ensure that there are no overlaps.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object 7: A Collision-Averse Approach**
           
           My primary objective is to strategically place Object 7, a square with dimensions approximately 0.093 units, onto Surface 0, a bounded region defined by (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). The goal: achieve 50 stable placements, taking into account pre-existing obstacles and surface limitations. I need to generate an understanding of the available space, and I will accomplish this by establishing a clear representation of the feasible regions.
           
           The first step is to establish the constraints for placing the object on the surface without any overlap with existing objects or going outside surface limits. To do this, I will need to take into account the size of Object 7 (half_side = 0.0465 units) and the presence of objects 4 and 5. This boils down to a classic spatial reasoning problem.  I determine the safe placement areas for Object 7 by formulating constraints, based on the coordinates (x7,y7) of Object 7's center:
           *   x7_min_allowed = x_min_surf + obj7_half_side
           *   x7_max_allowed = x_max_surf - obj7_half_side
           *   y7_min_allowed = y_min_surf + obj7_half_side
           *   y7_max_allowed = y_max_surf - obj7_half_side
           
           Next, I thoroughly analyze the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of Object 4, placed at (-0.089, -0.089), using the half side length of 0.0457. The bounds of object 4's bounding box are then given by:
           *   x_min_4 = -0.135
           *   x_max_4 = -0.043
           *   y_min_4 = -0.135
           *   y_max_4 = -0.043
           
           Then, I conduct a similar analysis for Object 5. It's center is at (-0.099, 0.011), with a side length of 0.070, and a half side of 0.0352. The Object 5 bounding box limits are then given by:
           *   x_min_5 = -0.135
           *   x_max_5 = -0.064
           *   y_min_5 = -0.024
           *   y_max_5 = 0.046
           
           The next critical step is to identify the collision-free zones for Object 7 concerning both objects.
           
           For Object 4, the conditions to avoid overlapping become:
           *   x7 >= 0.003
           *   y7 >= 0.003
           
           and for Object 5:
           *   x7 >= -0.018 or y7 <= -0.070
           
           After some experimentation and careful calculations, I am confident in these relationships. Therefore, I can combine all these considerations into a logical workflow.
           
           I will employ a methodical approach to identifying these locations. Specifically, I plan to generate a structured 10x10 grid across the surface. This will provide a comprehensive starting point for analyzing each potential placement. For each position within this grid, I will apply two crucial filters: one to check for potential overlap with Object 4, and the other to address the potential of overlapping with Object 5.
           
           Furthermore, I have determined the allowed ranges:
           
           Valid Locations:
           
           *   x_min = -0.088
           *   x_max = 0.088
           *   y_min = -0.088
           *   y_max = 0.088
           
           After careful examination of collision thresholds, 55 feasible positions have been found. Given that I require only 50 distinct positions with diverse orientations (achieved by rotating angles), this provides a solid solution. The planned 10 x 10 grid has proven to be a strategic choice for the identification of a significant number of valid positions, while avoiding complex geometry processing or more elaborate calculations. A range of rotation angles will be used for each position for variability, to get all 50 unique configurations.

(Thoughts: **My Strategic Approach to Placing Object 8 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's my plan: I need to get 50 stable placements of Object 8 onto Surface 0, avoiding those pesky Objects 4, 5, and 7.  First, I've calculated the dimensions of Object 8 (it's a square, thankfully!), and its half-side length, `obj8_half_side`. I've also established the boundaries of Surface 0.
           
           My goal is to find 50 safe (x, y) coordinates for the center of Object 8.  I've defined the valid range for x and y on the surface.  Next, I've calculated the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABB) for Objects 4, 5, and 7 to check for collision possibilities.
           
           I've carefully considered the collision avoidance conditions for Object 8 with each of the other objects. I've derived the safe regions where no collision can occur, by isolating each one.
           
           I then did some thorough analysis, figuring out which conditions are strict, where the bounds overlap, and which regions are easier to find. I realized that a significant area of Surface 0 is off-limits due to the other objects.
           
           This is where I saw the pattern!
           I derived a relatively large, safe region: where x is >= 0.024538, and y is within the surface boundaries.
           
           Knowing that region is valid, I'm setting up a 5x10 grid of placements, with x coordinates in that 'safe' zone, and y coordinates evenly spaced within the surface limits. I'll stick to a theta of zero (no rotation), because that is simpler and it works.
           
           I've confirmed that a total of 50 placements within this area should work perfectly, and I've constructed my coordinates for Object 8.

           Knowing that region is valid, I'm setting up a 5x10 grid of placements, with x coordinates in that 'safe' zone, and y coordinates evenly spaced within the surface limits. I'll stick to a theta of zero (no rotation), because that is simpler and it works.
           
           I've confirmed that a total of 50 placements within this area should work perfectly, and I've constructed my coordinates for Object 8.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable locations for Object ID 6 (a square) on Surface 0, avoiding collisions with the already-placed objects (IDs 4, 5, 7, and 8).  The first thing I did was define the size of Object 6, which has a side length of `0.097204288169185`.  That means the half-side is `0.0486021440845925`.
           
           I know the surface's boundaries are `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. To keep Object 6 inside, its center coordinates (x, y) are constrained: `-0.0863978559154075 <= x <= 0.0863978559154075` and `-0.0863978559154075 <= y <= 0.0863978559154075`.
           
           Now, the trick is avoiding the existing objects. I have to make sure that for each existing object, either Object 6's center is far enough along the x-axis or far enough along the y-axis, that the two objects' AABBs (Axis Aligned Bounding Boxes) don't overlap.  I worked through the calculations for each object:
           
           *   **Object 4:** `x >= 0.00515391203336634` OR `y >= 0.00515391203336634`
           *   **Object 5:** `x >= -0.01593120333440456` OR `y <= -0.072750284407924245` (Not viable, y condition is outside bounds)
           *   **Object 7:** `x >= 0.02630854574140411` OR `y >= 0.00664684594850556`
           *   **Object 8:** `x <= -0.07089574242778089` OR `y >= 0.007265556144032455`
           
           To simplify this, I aimed for a region where the y-conditions are dominant to streamline collision-free placements. The largest positive y threshold, `0.00726`, became the reference for my strategy. The goal is to move to an (x, y) location where the 'y' coordinate is greater than or equal to this threshold (`0.00726`).
           
           Based on this, I concluded a valid region for placement is: `x` from `-0.01593120333440456` to `0.0863978559154075`, and `y` from `0.007265556144032455` to `0.0863978559154075`.
           
           To get the 50 placements, I'll create a grid of (x,y) coordinates within this region. I'll use 7 values for x and 7 values for y, resulting in 49 positions within this bounding box.  Then, for each location (x, y), I will cycle through different rotation angles, such as `theta = i * (pi / 16)`, where 'i' is the iteration. The last placement (50) will be done with the center location (x and y) using a different angle. This approach should guarantee stable placements of Object 6, respecting the boundary and avoiding conflicts with previous objects.
