(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for a Square Object**
           
           Okay, I've got a clear picture of what's needed. I need to find 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5) with side length approximately 0.08 units on a square surface centered at (0,0) with side length 0.27 units. Stability means the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) must be completely within the surface's AABB.  This object is *square* which simplifies things a bit, but rotation introduces some complexities due to the AABB being angle-dependent.
           
           The key is to consider the object's AABB dimensions when *not* rotated (0.08 by 0.08) and how those dimensions change with rotation (theta).  For a square, the widest AABB occurs when rotated by 45 degrees, where the effective bounding box dimension is roughly 0.113 units.
           
           To generate a good set of placements, I'm going to leverage symmetry and generate different rotations.  I'll start with placing the object:
           
           1.  Aligned with the surface axes (rotations of 0 and 90 degrees) -  here the max displacement is approx 0.095 along each axis.
           2.  Then 45 degrees rotated - the limits decrease to around 0.078 along each axis.
           3.  Then I will space the other placements along the diagonal to keep a diverse set of angles.
           
           I need to generate a list of precise (x,y) locations and corresponding rotation angles (in radians), aiming for 50 placements in total.  Since a square has symmetry, I only need to calculate for rotations between 0 and 90 degrees, and the object dimensions determine the limits of placement.
           
           I've carefully calculated the maximum center coordinates for various rotations, accounting for the increased AABB due to rotation.  I'll generate placements with 0, 90, 45 degree rotations, and then place a few others along other rotations such as 22.5. degrees. This generates enough placements on the board to satisfy the criteria, and covers it completely.
           
           The process involves first establishing the bounds of the valid center points for each rotation and then distributing the positions across the valid space within the surface, maintaining a good angular distribution.

(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I'm being asked to generate a fresh set of 50 placements for object ID 5 on surface 0. Since we're dealing with the same object and the same surface, the key constraints – object size and surface dimensions – haven't changed.  The goal here is clearly to find a set that *works*, meaning stable and without collisions, given previous attempts may have failed due to unseen obstacles.
           
           My initial thought process is to leverage what I already know and diversify the approach.  I've already figured out the object's effective size and the surface bounds.  The object dimensions, `s = 0.0799884279840446`, haven't changed, nor have the surface bounds of `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.  I've also calculated the maximum coordinates for object centers based on different rotations.
           
           I need to vary both the object's rotation (theta) and its position (x, y) to increase my chances of success. I am not simply rotating by 0, 45, or 90 degrees; I am exploring the space in a more granular way.
           
           Previously, I had considered angles 0, pi/4, and pi/2. Now, I want to use:
           *   0
           *   pi/6 (30 degrees)
           *   pi/4 (45 degrees)
           *   pi/3 (60 degrees)
           *   pi/2 (90 degrees).
           
           Based on those angles, I'll calculate the valid extent for the center (x, y) and build a grid: 10 placements per angle.
           
           Calculations:
           *   `theta = 0, pi/2`: max coordinate 0.0950057860079777.
           *   `theta = pi/6, pi/3`: max coordinate 0.0804064600413.
           *   `theta = pi/4`: max coordinate 0.07843806935251105.
           
           Specifically, I'll create a structured approach:
           1.  **Angle 0**: Grid of 10 points within the valid area
           2.  **Angle pi/6**: Grid of 10 points within the valid area
           3.  **Angle pi/4**: Grid of 10 points within the valid area
           4.  **Angle pi/3**: Grid of 10 points within the valid area
           5.  **Angle pi/2**: Grid of 10 points within the valid area
           
           The chosen grid for each will be centered on (0, 0) and will include:
           *   Center (0,0)
           *   Max X, Y extents on edges
           *   Max X, Y extents on corners
           *   Intermediate points between center and edges.
           
           This systematically diverse approach should give a significantly improved likelihood of success. The format will be `(0, theta, x, y)`.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: A Detailed Analysis**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a new object (ID 4) that needs to be placed on Surface 0, right after Object 5. Object 5 is already sitting pretty at (0, 0, 0, 0), and I know it’s safe. The challenge? Make sure Object 4 doesn't bump into it and also stays within the boundaries of the surface.
           
           First things first, I've got the surface size, Object 5's size and position (a square at the origin), and now I have Object 4's dimensions: a square too, with a size 's4'. I know that Surface 0 half-width is 0.135 and Object 5's half-size is `s5_half`, which, right now is 0.0399.
           
           My constraints are two-fold:  stability on Surface 0, meaning Object 4’s full bounding box has to fit inside the surface, and collision avoidance - making sure Object 4's bounding box doesn't intersect Object 5's.
           
           To address the surface constraint, I need to know that for any rotation theta, the bounding box of Object 4, which has size W4,  has to be contained on surface 0, and has to be contained in the square. This is done by making sure `abs(x) <= L - W4/2` and `abs(y) <= L - H4/2`.
           
           For collision avoidance, I will need to be outside the existing object in either the X or Y coordinates, or both. This will involve the calculations to generate positions for object 4. I know that since Object 5 is square, it will be contained in the region defined by `-s5_half <= x <= s5_half` and `-s5_half <= y <= s5_half`. The bounding box, or AABB of object 4 is defined by `[x - W4/2, x + W4/2] x [y - H4/2, y + H4/2]`. I need this AABB of Object 4 to not intersect that of Object 5.
           
           I've crunched some numbers for different rotations. At 0 degrees, the max boundary coordinate x/y  is `L - s4/2`. When theta = 0, this max is about 0.099. At 45 degrees, the values are different, with W4 and H4 changing. I noticed that if I rotate Object 4 to 45 degrees,  the size of the bounding box increases, and I run out of room. This means the object 4 can't intersect with the existing object 5. This means that if Object 5 is centered on the origin, and I must use the formula, if `min_coord = s5_half + W4/2` then `|x| >= min_coord` and `|y| >= min_coord`.
           
           So, for Object 4, I will choose various positions for object 4 along the surface boundaries. To guarantee the boundary condition, and to guarantee collision avoidance, I need several positions for each coordinate value, with different values. I can use the max value `m = 0.0993` to set positions for x and y, and also use intermediate values, so there is not intersection. I also need to use the `min_coord = 0.0756`, as well as `mid_coord`, so that the space is also utilized effectively.
           For the initial state of object 4, the initial plan is to try locations with  theta values of 0 (x coordinates), pi/12, and pi/8.  With these values and several calculations, I will prepare many locations for object 4 where this placement does not lead to any collision.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Object Placement Strategy**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable locations for a new object (ID 6) on surface 0, while ensuring it doesn't collide with existing objects. I need to keep several key factors in mind:
           
           1.  **Surface Containment:** The object must stay within the surface's boundaries, which are defined as `[(-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)]`.
           
           2.  **Collision Avoidance:**
               *   **Object 5 (ID 5):** This object is located at (0, 0, 0, 0) and has an AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of `[-0.0399, 0.0399]` x `[-0.0399, 0.0399]`. I must ensure that the new object does not overlap with this area.
               *   **Object 4 (ID 4):** This object is positioned at (0, 0, 0.0756, 0) and, at a theta of 0, has an AABB of `[0.0399, 0.1112] x [-0.0356, 0.0356]`. I need to avoid collisions here as well.
           
           The new object (ID 6) has a dimension `s6 = 0.0867`.  I define a surface half-width `L = 0.135`. At an angle `theta` (rotation), Object 6's effective width and height are `W6 = H6 = s6 * (|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|)`. I also need to calculate the half-width, `W6_half = W6 / 2`.
           
           To meet the surface containment requirement, I need `|x| <= L - W6_half` and `|y| <= L - W6_half`, where `max_coord_6 = L - W6_half`.
           
           To avoid Object 5, I set `min_sep_5 = 0.0399 + W6_half`. I will need `|x| >= min_sep_5` OR `|y| >= min_sep_5`.
           
           To avoid Object 4, I will use:
           `(x+W6_half <= x4_min)` OR `(x-W6_half >= x4_max)` OR `(y+W6_half <= y4_min)` OR `(y-W6_half >= y4_max)`
           
           After considering all these requirements, I have determined that it is best to set `theta=0`.
           
           In the case that `theta=0`,
           `max_coord_6 = 0.0916`.
           
           My strategy will be to create placements based on the following:
           
           Exclusion zones:
           *   Center: `|x| < 0.0833` AND `|y| < 0.0833` (This is where the object is colliding with object 5.)
           *   Rectangle from Object 4: `(-0.0033, 0.1546)` x `(-0.0789, 0.0789)`.
           
           **Regions to sample**:
           I will define the following (all theta=0) to place our object:
           1.  Top & Bottom strips (y is large): Points with `y` outside the exclusions (y> 0.083, y< -0.083). In this case `x` can be anything in `[-0.091, 0.091]`
           2.  Left strip (x is negative large): points with `x` outside the exclusions (x< -0.083). In this case `y` can be anything in `[-0.091, 0.091]`
           3.  Right strip (x is positive large): `x` is in `[0.083, 0.091]`. In this case I will use `y` to ensure that it does not overlap.
           4.  Then will follow a grid-like approach.
           I will use the coordinates in `y_coords = [C, S5_EX, (C+S5_EX)/2, Y4_EX_TOP, Y4_EX_BOTTOM, 0, -S5_EX, -C]` to place Object 6.

Model:     **Summary of Object Placement Strategy**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable locations for a new object (ID 6) on surface 0, while ensuring it doesn't collide with existing objects. I need to keep several key factors in mind:
           
           1.  **Surface Containment:** The object must stay within the surface's boundaries, which are defined as `[(-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)]`.
           
           2.  **Collision Avoidance:**
               *   **Object 5 (ID 5):** This object is located at (0, 0, 0, 0) and has an AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of `[-0.0399, 0.0399]` x `[-0.0399, 0.0399]`. I must ensure that the new object does not overlap with this area.
               *   **Object 4 (ID 4):** This object is positioned at (0, 0, 0.0756, 0) and, at a theta of 0, has an AABB of `[0.0399, 0.1112] x [-0.0356, 0.0356]`. I need to avoid collisions here as well.
           
           The new object (ID 6) has a dimension `s6 = 0.0867`.  I define a surface half-width `L = 0.135`. At an angle `theta` (rotation), Object 6's effective width and height are `W6 = H6 = s6 * (|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|)`. I also need to calculate the half-width, `W6_half = W6 / 2`.
           
           To meet the surface containment requirement, I need `|x| <= L - W6_half` and `|y| <= L - W6_half`, where `max_coord_6 = L - W6_half`.
           
           To avoid Object 5, I set `min_sep_5 = 0.0399 + W6_half`. I will need `|x| >= min_sep_5` OR `|y| >= min_sep_5`.
           
           To avoid Object 4, I will use:
           `(x+W6_half <= x4_min)` OR `(x-W6_half >= x4_max)` OR `(y+W6_half <= y4_min)` OR `(y-W6_half >= y4_max)`
           
           After considering all these requirements, I have determined that it is best to set `theta=0`.
           
           In the case that `theta=0`,
           `max_coord_6 = 0.0916`.
           
           My strategy will be to create placements based on the following:
           
           Exclusion zones:
           *   Center: `|x| < 0.0833` AND `|y| < 0.0833` (This is where the object is colliding with object 5.)
           *   Rectangle from Object 4: `(-0.0033, 0.1546)` x `(-0.0789, 0.0789)`.
           
           **Regions to sample**:
           I will define the following (all theta=0) to place our object:
           1.  Top & Bottom strips (y is large): Points with `y` outside the exclusions (y> 0.083, y< -0.083). In this case `x` can be anything in `[-0.091, 0.091]`
           2.  Left strip (x is negative large): points with `x` outside the exclusions (x< -0.083). In this case `y` can be anything in `[-0.091, 0.091]`
           3.  Right strip (x is positive large): `x` is in `[0.083, 0.091]`. In this case I will use `y` to ensure that it does not overlap.
           4.  Then will follow a grid-like approach.
           I will use the coordinates in `y_coords = [C, S5_EX, (C+S5_EX)/2, Y4_EX_TOP, Y4_EX_BOTTOM, 0, -S5_EX, -C]` to place Object 6.
