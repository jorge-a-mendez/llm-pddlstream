           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Path to New Axiom**
           
           My task is to create a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, given the initial state. The initial conditions are already met for some predicates in the axiom. My focus is on achieving:
           
           1.  `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`.
           2.  `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (where the type of the `?stone` is `v2`).
           3.  `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (where the type of the `?soil` is `v6`).
           
           To achieve the `receivedimage` goals, I need to use the `send_image` action, which requires `haveimage`.  This, in turn, is provided by the `take_image` action.  `Take_image` relies on calibration, which is achieved by the `calibrate` action.  I have two rovers, v12 and v14, both capable of imaging.  Given that it looks like the rover's initial poses (`v13`, `v15`) are where all the work has to be done, I'll use rover v12 for calibration, taking and sending image of three objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`). The `take_image` invalidates the calibration, so it has to be done three times.
           
           For the analysis goals, I will employ the `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` actions.  I need to pick a rock of type `v2` (stone) and one of type `v6` (soil).  I can see that rock v1 has type v2, so I choose it, and I can see rock v5 has type v6. I will assume that the rovers are already in the correct configuration, as there are no movement actions possible. Rover v12 will sample and analyze rock v1, and rover v14 will do likewise for v5.
           
           Here is the strategy:
           1.  **Image Processing:**
               *   **For each objective:**
                   *   Calibrate `v12`
                   *   Take image.
                   *   Send image.
           2.  **Analysis:**
               *   `v12`: Sample rock v1 and send the analysis.
               *   `v14`: Sample rock v5 and send the analysis.
           
           It is likely that the continuous parameters are effectively bound to their initial values. Given the allowed actions, and the continuous parameters `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` resolving to the current configurations `v13` and `v15`.
           
           The objects like v1, v3, v4 are of type v2. And the objects like v5, v7, v8 are of type v6. The goal is satisfied because we have satisfied the existential quantifier with a stone of type v2 and the soil of type v6.
           
           Thus I will achieve the `new-axiom@0()` goal through calibration and image sending, sample and analyzing rocks using both rovers, while operating under the assumption that the rovers' starting configurations will be their action locations.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v12 v13 #o4 v17 v10), (take_image v12 v13 #o4 v17 v10 v11), (send_image v12 v13 #o1 v9 v17 v11), (calibrate v12 v13 #o4 v18 v10), (take_image v12 v13 #o4 v18 v10 v11), (send_image v12 v13 #o1 v9 v18 v11), (calibrate v12 v13 #o4 v19 v10), (take_image v12 v13 #o4 v19 v10 v11), (send_image v12 v13 #o1 v9 v19 v11), (sample_rock v12 v13 v1 v16), (send_analysis v12 v13 #o1 v9 v1), (sample_rock v14 v15 v5 v16), (send_analysis v14 v15 #o1 v9 v5)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Planning Problem**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a bit of a slap on the wrist – I used actions that weren't actually *valid* for this specific instance. I got confused because I had the complete set of possible actions in the domain, but then there was a restricted subset that I was supposed to be using. My mistake.
           
           Let's break down the situation. The problem is trying to reach the `new-axiom@0()` goal, which demands a bunch of conditions to be met. I've got to make sure that the rocks are in the right configuration and that the analyses have been received. 
           
           Looking at the goal, conditions 5-9 all involve `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. I can't do anything about these with the available restricted actions.  The *only* allowed actions are:
           
           *   `move v12 v13 #o2 v13`
           *   `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`
           *   `drop_rock v12 v16`
           *   `drop_rock v14 v16`
           
           Now, let's analyze those. The `move` actions don't change the `atconf` positions, and the precondition for `drop_rock` is `full(vX, vY)`, but I have `free(vX, vY)`. So, the `drop_rock` actions aren't applicable in the current state.  Moreover, none of the available actions touch on the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates in the goal state.
           
           Therefore, with the given allowed actions, I've concluded that the goal state is simply *unreachable*. I will need to provide feedback to the problem setup and explain that the current configuration and action restrictions are logically inconsistent.
