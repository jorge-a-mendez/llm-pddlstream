           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Here's how I'm thinking about this:**
           
           The core of the problem is generating 50 stable placements of a square object (ID 5, size 0.0898) within a larger square surface (Surface 0, side 0.27, centered at (0,0)).  I need to find  `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)` for each placement. The key constraint is that the object *must* be fully contained within the surface.
           
           First, I identified the surface and object's dimensions and the surface bounds (ranging from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135)).  Since it's a square, calculating the rotation's effect on the object's boundaries is relatively straightforward. I need to figure out what happens when you rotate the square.
           
           For a square, the effective half-dimension of the bounding box will change with the rotation, the dimensions range from 0.0449 (at 0 degrees rotation) to sqrt(2) * 0.0449 = 0.063499 (at 45 degrees rotation). To ensure the object is always contained I will use the *smallest* value: `effective_half_dim = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.
           
           To ensure stability and containment in the surface, the object's center `(x, y)` must lie within the surface's bounds, accounting for the object's rotation (and thus, the *effective* bounding box).  This translates to `lower_bound_x + effective_half_dim <= x <= upper_bound_x - effective_half_dim` and similar bounds for `y`.
           
           The strategy I'm employing is to vary the rotation (`theta`) and then generate `(x, y)` placements within the allowable region for that rotation. My main strategy consists of choosing a set of rotation angles and then calculating the maximum allowed range `[-M, M]` (where `M = surf_half_side - effective_half_dim`) for the center coordinates `x` and `y` for each of these rotations. I chose angles `0, pi/12, pi/8, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, 5*pi/12`. To make sure there is enough coverage and the placements don't overlap too much I use various points for each region.
           
           For each rotation I'm computing the actual *maximum* coordinate value by rounding down the `M` values to 4 decimal points.
           
           To make sure I have 50 placements, I'm generating 9 positions for each of first 5 rotations which yields `5 * 9 = 45`, then I'm generating 5 positions for the last rotation for a total of 50. I carefully selected (center, mid-edges, corners) positions to get good coverage in the placement region, which is all contained within Surface 0.
           
           So, in the end, it's a matter of calculating the appropriate `theta`, `x`, and `y` values that satisfy the containment and stability criteria for a variety of orientations and positions.

(Thoughts: **My approach to placing Object 7.**
           
           Okay, I've got a new challenge: place object 7 (a square) on surface 0 without colliding with the existing square object 5, already fixed at the origin. I know object 5's placement worked previously, so I can use that knowledge. I need to generate 50 stable placements for object 7, and since it's a new object, I've no collision history to guide me.
           
           The surface is a square of side 0.27 centered at the origin. Object 7 is a square with side approximately 0.09. Crucially, I have to ensure object 7 doesn't collide with object 5, which is essentially at (0,0).
           
           Since I am an expert in this field, I can calculate using formulas. The key is in calculating how to find safe placement. I can use the AABB approach, bounding boxes, to find safe and stable placements. I quickly determined the effective half-dimensions of the squares. Object 5 has half-side `s5`, which means the collision boundary will be a square too.  If object 7 is at a position `(x7, y7)`, the same half dimensions apply to object 7. I found the size bounds the object 7 can be, the maximum distance the corners can be from the center to stay within a surface. That will be useful for placing an object.
           
           The approach involves calculating the "collision zone," which is the area around the origin where object 7's center *cannot* be, or the zone in which collision would occur. I need to make sure I calculate the placement, as the object can be rotated.  So I also need to calculate the bounding dimension.
           
           I began by trying a rotation of 0 degrees for object 7. In this configuration, the available safe placement area turned out to be nearly non-existent. My analysis showed that the size of Object 7 means it *will* collide with object 5 if object 7 is at the center of the surface, at `(0,0)`. I got the conclusion that for this size and the fixed object, there are *no* safe positions using rotation 0. I had to rethink the approach.
           
           Because I need 50 points, and the surface area is restricted, my best bet is to only use those safe angles. That means I will place Object 7 at rotation of 0.
           
           So the main challenge is working around the collision zone and efficiently filling the available space. I worked out the precise boundary coordinates for where the center of object 7 must lie to avoid collision, which turned out to be very close to the edges of the surface.  I was able to determine the width of the safe strips. Since this is a square object, it makes the math simpler. I broke up the surface into four zones, two horizontal strips and two vertical strips. The zones are the locations around the object, and within the object's boundaries.
           
           I created a strategy to ensure I had 50 diverse placements using a set of coordinates with the rotation of `0`. To get all those coordinates, I worked out the distance, and the coordinates to fill the safe strips. Finally, I will send the information of 50 stable positions to the request.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Object Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. I need to place 50 stable instances of Object 4 on Surface 0, making sure they don't collide with the fixed objects already there. Surface 0 is a square, centered at the origin, with sides of length 0.27, so I have a total area of 0.0729 to work with. There are two fixed objects: Object 5 at the origin and Object 7 at a specific location slightly off-center.
           
           To ensure stability, I'm focusing on "stable" placements - I'll stick with 0 degrees rotation, which minimizes the object's effective size and makes placement calculations easier. The effective size of Object 4 (considering its square shape) is  0.037.
           
           **Key Constraints and Calculations:**
           
           1.  **Surface Containment:** The center of Object 4 must be within the surface boundaries. The surface's half-side is 0.135, and after accounting for the object's effective size at 0 degree rotation, the center of object 4 must reside within a smaller square inside the surface.
           
           2.  **Collision Avoidance (Object 5):** Object 5, located at the origin, has a size of 0.0898, giving it an AABB of [-0.0449, 0.0449]. Object 4 must not overlap this. This means the center of Object 4 must be at least 0.0822 away from the origin in either the x or y direction, to avoid collisions.
           
           3.  **Collision Avoidance (Object 7):** Object 7 is located at (0.09, -0.09) with dimensions 0.09.  Its AABB can be calculated from that. Object 4's center must be positioned to avoid the rectangle that defines this, and the center also need to avoid this region. To do this, I need to account for the object size of 4, with the effective size being added to the x or y edges for collision.
           
           **Placement Algorithm**
           
           I will generate points to place, while abiding the following conditions. The goal is to generate 50 points, such that they do not overlap each other, and do not overlap objects 5 or 7.
           *   Step 1. First I defined a set of allowed zones within the surface.
           *   Step 2. I would pick points in the corners of the surface, which would not intersect the other objects.
           *   Step 3. Check for any overlap and repeat for 50 placements.
           *   Step 4. Finally I verified the placements, making sure none of the constraints were violated.
           
           **Refinement of Placement Points**
           
           After the placement calculations, I had to ensure that the total placement region was free of any overlaps.
           I've chosen 50 points to place, to satisfy the following points:
           
           1.  There must be 5 y-coordinates at x = 0.09, where y = 0.0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08
           2.  There must be 7 y coordinates at x= -0.09, with coordinates: -0.08, -0.06, -0.04, -0.02, 0.0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08,
           3.  There must be 7 x coordinates for y = 0.09 with coordinates: -0.08, -0.06, -0.04, -0.02, 0.0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08.
           4.  There must be 5 x coordinates for y = -0.09, with coordinates: -0.08, -0.06, -0.04, -0.02, 0.0.
           5.  There must be 5 points at x = 0.0822 with y = 0.0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08.
           6.  There must be 7 points at x= -0.0822, with coordinates -0.08, -0.06, -0.04, -0.02, 0.0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08.

           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (Object ID 6) on a flat surface (Surface 0), while avoiding existing obstacles. Here's my plan:
           
           1.  **Understand the Space:** I've defined the available area on Surface 0, which is a square with a side length of approximately 0.270.  I've also calculated the object's dimensions (0.0708 x 0.0708) and realized it's a square. I'll need to account for three fixed obstacles:
               *   **Object ID 5:** Centered at (0, 0)
               *   **Object ID 7:** Centered at approximately (0.09, -0.09)
               *   **Object ID 4:** Centered at (0.0977, 0)
           
           2.  **Define a Search Space:** I need to work within the surface area, which means my placement coordinates (x, y) for the object's center must stay within `[-0.0996, 0.0996] x [-0.0996, 0.0996]`.
           
           3.  **Account for Obstacle Exclusion Zones:** I have calculated the 'forbidden zones' around each obstacle, ensuring that my placement for Object ID 6 doesn't overlap with any of them. The exclusions are calculated using the sum of half the size of Object 6 (`s6`) and each obstacle's bounding box to account for collision.
               *   **Obstacle 5:** Excludes a square centered on (0, 0).
               *   **Obstacle 7:** Excludes a rectangular region in the bottom-right part of the surface, but also overlaps with the surface edges.
               *   **Obstacle 4:** Excludes a rectangular region in the right part of the surface.
           
           4.  **Find Safe Placement Zones:** Based on the exclusion zones, I've identified four "safe" regions for Object ID 6:
               *   **Left Strip:** Anywhere along the left edge.
               *   **Top Right:** Any vertical range where the x is greater than 0.0803.
               *   **Bottom Right:** Similar to Top-right.
               *   **Top:** Across the whole surface, but only y >= 0.0803.
               *   **Inner top-left and bottom-left:** This is the space in the top-left section and the bottom-left section, not around the central obstacle.
           
           5.  **Placement Point Generation:** I will place 50 objects in these regions.
           
           I'll start with placing them on a small grid, then iterate over each set of valid coordinates.
