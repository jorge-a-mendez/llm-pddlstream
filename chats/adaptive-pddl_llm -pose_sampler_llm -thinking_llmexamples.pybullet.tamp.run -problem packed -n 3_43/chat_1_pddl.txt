           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Path to Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. My goal is clear: I need to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all stacked on top of `v16`.  Right now, they're sitting pretty on `v11`.  The initial conditions are straightforward: my base configuration is `v3`, the arms (`v4` and `v6`) are empty, and the target objects are all graspable.  The initial supported facts are: `on(v12, v11)`, `on(v14, v11)`, and `on(v8, v11)`. The goal is to get to: `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`. The actions involve moving these objects from their initial location to a supporting relationship on `v16` (pose #o2). Since `stackable` facts are given, I can place them on `v16`.
           
           The solution involves a sequence of pick-and-place actions. The key is that `v4` is the working arm. Since `v6` is handempty, I should analyze it, but there are no relevant `kin` facts.
           
           Here's the sequence I've worked out:
           
           1.  **Pick v12:** I'll use arm `v4` to pick `v12` from its current pose `v13`.
           2.  **Place v12:**  I'll place `v12` onto `v16` at position `#o2`.
           3.  **Pick v14:** Now it's time to pick up `v14` from `v15` using arm `v4`.
           4.  **Place v14:**  I'll place `v14` onto `v16` at position `#o2`.
           5.  **Pick v8:**  Finally, I'll pick `v8` from `v9` with arm `v4`.
           6.  **Place v8:**  I'll place `v8` onto `v16` at position `#o2`.
           
           The critical assumption is that I can safely place objects next to each other on `v16` at `#o2` without causing any collisions, as cfreepose is stated as true. The safety constraints about collision will be met. There's no need to change the base configuration, as it remains at `v3` throughout. The plan ensures that arm `v4` is empty and that each object is `atgrasp` before any `pick` or `place` action.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Problem's Constraints**
           
           Okay, so I messed up. I completely misinterpreted the instruction regarding the "list of valid action instances." I thought it was a guide to potential actions, not a *strict* limitation. My previous plan used `pick` and `place`, which are clearly not allowed.  The only action I'm given to work with is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.
           
           My goal is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all *on* `v16`. Currently, they are all *on* `v11`.  The initial state contains the necessary supporting and atpose predicates to deduce this initial `on` state.
           
           Now, let's dissect `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. Its preconditions are all satisfied in the initial state: `basemotion`, `atbconf`, and `canmove`. The effects are tricky.  We have `atbconf` added and deleted, which logically cancels out.  The only *real* effect is negating `canmove`.  Essentially, this action makes the robot *incapable* of base movement *without actually moving the base*.
           
           Thinking through the implications: this action doesn't change anything relevant to achieving the goal of placing objects. It's a "do-nothing" action for object manipulation, and then limits subsequent base movement, which isn't even helpful as there are no other base movements in the action set.
           
           Since the goal relies on modifying the *on* relationships between objects, and the *only* available action does nothing to manipulate objects, I've hit a dead end.  The given goal is *unachievable* with the prescribed action. It's fundamentally impossible to solve this problem with the available tools.
