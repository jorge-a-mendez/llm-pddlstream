(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 6**
           
           Okay, I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for an object (ID 6, dimensions: 0.09866710833012818, 0.0986671083301282) on a square surface (0:  ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))). Since the object's dimensions are almost equal (it's essentially square), stability is guaranteed by containment within the surface. The surface is the only available, no prior objects or obstacles. I need to generate placements in the format `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`.  `surf_idx` is `0` for all placements.
           
           The key is to determine valid ranges for the object's center `(x, y)` given a rotation angle `theta`. I know that the most restrictive case will be `theta=pi/4`, because then the object's effective bounding box is largest.  For any `theta`, the effective AABB dimensions are calculated by rotating the original AABB.  To keep the object inside the surface, the object's center needs to be within the rectangle formed by subtracting half the bounding box's dimensions from the original square surface.
           
           I'll generate a list of 5 different angles: `0`, `pi/8`, `pi/4`, `3*pi/8`, and `pi/2`.  Because of the symmetry of the square and the geometry, it's enough to consider the first quadrant (0 to pi/2).  For each angle, I will calculate the range within which the center point can be placed on the surface without the object's AABB extending beyond the surface boundaries.
           
           I've determined I need at least 10 placements per angle for a total of 50. I'll use a `4x3` grid of `x` and `y` coordinates for the range associated to each angle. This yields 12 placements, 60 total, so I'll truncate the placements to the first 50. The resulting algorithm iterates through the chosen angles, generates a grid for the possible center points, creates valid placements in the desired format, and then selects the first 50 for the final output. The format of the output is always `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 5**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed object ID 6 at `(0, 0.0, -0.08566644583493591, -0.0856664458349359)` on surface 0. Now, I need to figure out where to put object ID 5 without any collisions.
           
           Object 6 is a near-square, with dimensions of about `0.0986671` x `0.0986671`, and it's already snug in the bottom-left corner of the surface 0, centered at `(-0.08566644583493591, -0.0856664458349359)`. The surface itself is a rectangle of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. Object 5 is also a near-square, but slightly smaller at `0.07064084431166956` x `0.0706408443116695`.
           
           My plan is to find 50 valid placements for object 5. The key is to account for the rotation of object 5 and the exclusion zone created by object 6. I'll test 5 rotations (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2).
           
           Here's how I'm thinking:
           
           1.  **Rotation and Effective Dimensions:** For each rotation angle (`theta`), calculate the effective width (`effective_w`) and height (`effective_h`) of object 5. Because these objects are almost square, the effective dimensions will become slightly larger.
           2.  **Surface Limits:** Determine the valid center range for object 5 based on the surface boundaries, considering its rotation and effective dimensions.
           3.  **Collision Avoidance:** Calculate an exclusion zone around object 6. This rectangular exclusion zone, is based on the center of the already placed object 6 and the corresponding rotated AABB.
           4.  **Valid Placements:** Generate a grid of candidate center points on the surface, filtering for valid locations: points must lie within surface limits *and* outside the exclusion zone.
           
           Let's test `theta = 0`. With the almost-square objects, there will only be minor effective dimension increase as a result of the rotation. To avoid collision, object 5's center must be far enough from object 6's AABB for the current rotation.  For `theta = 0`, I will use a simple calculation to generate a series of candidate x and y values, and I filter out those points within the exclusion zone (which covers the bottom-left corner of the surface).
           
           For any other rotation angle `theta`, the calculation will follow similarly, resulting in new valid candidate locations. I'm choosing a few points per rotation to generate candidate `(x, y)` coordinates and test them.
           
           I will iterate through the angles and test many points. This method allows me to generate 50 valid, collision-free positions.
