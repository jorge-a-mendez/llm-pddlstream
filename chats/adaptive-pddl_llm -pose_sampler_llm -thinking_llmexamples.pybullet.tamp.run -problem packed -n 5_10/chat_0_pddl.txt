(Thoughts: **Placing Object ID 7 on Surface 0**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a near-square object (ID 7) on a square surface (Surface 0). Given my understanding of bounding box containment, I know that for a placement to be stable, the rotated bounding box of the object must fit entirely within the surface's bounding box.
           
           The surface is quite large relative to the object. I've calculated that even with rotation, the object's maximum effective half-width/height is approximately 0.06977, much smaller than the surface dimensions. This means there's considerable leeway in both position and orientation.
           
           To generate a diverse set of placements, I'll use a grid-like approach. I'll consider 8 equally spaced rotation angles, with a focus on the most common rotations. Since the object is almost square, I expect the effective size to change minimally with rotation. I also define x and y coordinates that are carefully selected so that the bounds for those coordinates are suitable for all angles.
           
           For the x and y coordinates, I decided to take the largest bounds for which all the objects would fit on the surface without colliding with the edges. By generating 5 positions each for the x and y values for each angle, and ensuring that I would have an ordered set of angle, x, and y values, this set would contain the required 50. I've generated a grid of 25 positions (5x5) and will cycle through a small set of rotation angles to satisfy the request.
           
           This approach gives me a good spread of placements while ensuring stability and containment.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Placing Object 6: A Strategic Approach**
           
           Alright, I've got the feedback, object 7 is successfully placed. Now, I need to figure out where to put object 6, a square object (ID 6) with dimensions 0.07865245308331825 by 0.07865245308331825, on the same surface. My primary goal is to find 50 stable placements for it, making absolutely sure it doesn't bump into object 7.
           
           Object 7 is currently situated at (-0.06, -0.06) with a length and width of roughly 0.09868.  It's positioned at a 0-degree angle. I've calculated the boundaries of its area, which is roughly a square region on the lower left of the surface. Object 6 can rotate, so I need to account for that. The effective range for the center of object 6, regardless of its rotation, should be approximately within a range of about [-0.0794, 0.0794] in both the X and Y axes, to ensure it stays on the surface.
           
           I've determined I need to avoid the space occupied by Object 7 which is roughly a square with the x and y ranges [-0.1093, -0.0107].
           
           I started by visualizing a grid and looking at different rotations.
           
           I've made sure to correctly test for collision by comparing bounding boxes.
           I've determined a safe placement for this is on the top-right quarter of the surface, with a center location of (0.06, 0.06).
           In a systemic iteration, I'm checking for collisions to make sure there are no other placements like this.
           
           I've discovered that to avoid collisions I need Object 6's AABB to be either greater than the right side of Object 7's area, or above the top side of object 7's area. With that in mind, I developed a plan.
           
           To find these places, I did a more precise approach.
           
           *   **Surface Bounds:** The surface is contained within the coordinates (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           *   **Object Placement:** Object 7's AABB is  (-0.10934, -0.01066) x (-0.10934, -0.01066).  Since Object 6's is 0.07865 long on each side, I need to do the math to ensure it doesn't collide, with a test that either X and Y of Object 6 is to the right of the object 7 or above it.
           *   **Collision Detection:** I defined a collision-detection function and an "on-surface" check.
           
           I did a systematic approach to search on surface points and angles, and built this list.

(Thoughts: **My Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking to tackle this object placement problem, breaking it down step by step as a placement expert would:
           
           1.  **Define the Problem:** I need to find 50 stable placements for a new object (ID: 5) on a surface. Two other objects are already placed and act as obstacles.
           
           2.  **Surface and Obstacle Analysis:**
               *   **Surface:** The working area is a rectangle with dimensions (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
               *   **Object 7:** I've calculated the bounding box of Object 7 (AABB), which is key for collision detection.
               *   **Object 6:**  Same process for Object 6 – understanding its AABB is crucial.
           
           3.  **Object 5 Properties:**
               *   **Dimensions:** Object 5 is almost square, so its half-width and half-height are close.
               *   **Rotation:** I'm initially aiming for a rotation of 0 degrees for simplicity, but I need to consider 45 degrees later if more space is needed.
           
           4.  **Constraints (the heart of this task):**
               *   **Surface Bounds:** The object's center has to stay within the surface limits, considering its size and rotation.
               *   **No Collision - Object 7:** The new object can't overlap with the pre-placed Object 7's AABB. I've got the necessary collision conditions: `x_max <= obj7_min_x` etc.
               *   **No Collision - Object 6:** Same logic here for Object 6.
           
           5.  **Strategy:**
               *   **Grid Search:** I'll use a grid to explore possible center points (`x_c`, `y_c`).
               *   **Rotation First:** Starting with 0 degrees rotation is the easiest. If I need to search beyond those, will move to 45 degrees.
               *   **Step Size:** I'm going to set a grid step of 0.01 for the x,y plane and use the existing formulas and a basic collision-check with my AABB constraints to validate whether a placement is valid.
           
           6.  **Collision Checks:** I've worked out the exact formula to determine if, for a given center point and angle, the new object's AABB overlaps with the obstacle AABBs, using the derived formulas.
           
           7.  **Execution and Fine-tuning:** Once I've verified the rules, I can start generating valid placements.
           
           In essence, I'm setting up a systematic search, checking for collisions, and then expanding as necessary using a finer grid to find 50 stable placements. I have an efficient algorithm now and my strategy now is to use that efficient algo to generate 110 placements, then select the first 50 as my final answer.
