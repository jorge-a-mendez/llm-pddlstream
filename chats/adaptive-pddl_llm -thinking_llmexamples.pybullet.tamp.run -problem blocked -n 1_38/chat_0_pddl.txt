           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially means I need to have an object of a specific type (v17) "on" another object (v18).  Specifically, I'm trying to get `v12` onto `v18`.  `v12` *is* the right type, which is good.  It looks stackable, so that's also promising.
           
           The initial state shows `v12` is currently *on* `v14`.  Clearly, to reach the goal, I need to manipulate `v12`.  My intuition tells me that means a 'pick' and 'place' action.
           
           However, here's the rub.  I'm only *allowed* to use the single action instance `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  No `pick` or `place` instances are in the allowed actions.  That's a huge constraint.
           
           The `move_base` action itself won't directly change the 'on' predicate. It's really only for robot movement. Since I can't pick up or put down objects, I can't move `v12` from its current position on `v14` to the desired `v18`.
           
           My expert judgment is clear: Given this crippling limitation on available actions, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is simply **unachievable**. The robot is effectively unable to interact with the world in the way needed to satisfy the goal. No `pick` and `place` means no change in the spatial relationship between v12 and v18.
