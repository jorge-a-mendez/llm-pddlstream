           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Unattainability of the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which I've expanded to `on(?green, v18) ∧ type(?green, v17)`. My initial thought is to identify potential candidates for `?green` that satisfy `type(?green, v17)`.  I find `v8` and `v12` fit the bill.
           
           Now, to satisfy `on(?green, v18)`, I need to find a `?green` that is both *supported* by `v18` and at the correct pose (`atpose`).  I see that both `v8` and `v12` currently have poses different from `#o2`, which is what I need to be *on v18*. Specifically `v8` has `atpose(v8, v9)` and `v12` has `atpose(v12, v13)`.
           
           The crucial issue arises from the limited action instances I'm allowed to use.  I'm only given `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This means I *cannot* use `pick` or `place` actions, which are necessary to change the `atpose` of `v8` or `v12` and, consequently, make them `on v18`.
           
           I've carefully re-read the problem's constraints:  I can't use actions that aren't explicitly listed. Since no `pick` or `place` instances are allowed, changing the `atpose` facts is impossible.  This is a significant roadblock.
           
           I then check whether I can satisfy the goal with the initial state, just to be sure. I evaluate both `on(v8, v18)` and `on(v12, v18)`. In both scenarios, the `on` predicate evaluates to `false` because the current `atpose` facts don't align with the *supported* facts for `v18`.
           
           Even though the available action, `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, is valid to execute, its effects won't impact `atpose` or `on` facts. It simply adjusts the robot's base configuration.  Therefore, executing this action won't bring me any closer to achieving the goal. This action makes the `canmove()` predicate false.
           
           In conclusion, I've determined that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable given the initial state and the limited action instances provided. The constraint on actions effectively prevents me from manipulating the `atpose` facts, making it impossible to satisfy the core requirement of the goal.
