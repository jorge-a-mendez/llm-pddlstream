(Thoughts: **A Plan to Satisfy new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, so the objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. Examining the axiom definition, it seems I need an object of a certain type that's *on* a specific surface. Let's see...  `new-axiom@0()` boils down to having something of type `v17` be placed *on* `v18`. I've got a couple of objects of that type available in the initial state: `v8` and `v12`. Both are candidates.  Since I'm looking for a plan, and not an exhaustive search, let's start with `v12` and figure out how to get it on `v18`.
           
           Looking at the initial state, `v18` appears to be a region or surface.  Ah, `stackable(v12, v18)` is true – good!  That means `v12` *can* be placed on it.  Currently, `v12` is *supported* at pose `v13` (its pose is defined as `atpose(v12, v13)` in the initial state). The robot needs to `place` `v12` on `v18`.  
           
           To do that, I'm thinking I'll need a standard *pick* and *place* sequence.  First, the robot has to pick up `v12` from where it's currently supported. Then, it has to place the object onto `v18` on a suitable pose. Let's see... what's required for *pick*? The robot arm needs to be empty, and it needs to be at the correct base configuration. I see that the arm `v4` is currently empty and `atbconf(v3)`. So, step one, I'll need to move the robot base from `v3` to a configuration suitable for picking up `v12` (let's call that `#o3`). The system has a function for moving the base with traj `#o0`.  This first step sets me up to pick up `v12`. I know `v12` has grasp `#o1`.
           
           After some preliminary investigation, here's my plan:
           
           1.  **Move the base:** The robot must move its base from configuration `v3` to `#o3` (the base must move to a configuration that will allow it to manipulate the object) using action `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`.
           2.  **Pick up the object:** Then, I need to pick up `v12` using arm `v4`.  The plan will be using action `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4`.
           3.  **Place the object:** Finally, to place `v12` onto `v18`, I'll use the  `place` action: `place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`. Here `#o2` is an appropriate supported pose.
           
           This sequence of actions should achieve `new-axiom@0()`! The final check is whether `new-axiom@0()` is true, and it will be true once `v12` is placed in `v18` based on the axiom definition. The plan checks out. All actions that I am using are in the allowed actions provided. So, there is no need to make any alterations to the plan.
