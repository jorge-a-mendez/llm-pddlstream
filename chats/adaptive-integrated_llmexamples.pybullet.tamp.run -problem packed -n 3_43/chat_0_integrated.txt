User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object

           v7: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.121, 0.281), (0.219, 0.379)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.238, -0.036, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.201, 0.98).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.135, -0.446, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.957, -0.291).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.183, -0.495), (-0.086, -0.398)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.192, -0.082), (0.284, 0.01)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.17, 0.33, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.365, 0.931).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom canmove()

           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom atpose(v14, v15)

           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)

           Atom pose(v8, #o2)

           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable objects: v8, v12, and v14. They are currently located at poses v9, v13, and v15 respectively, all supported by v11. The goal is to place all three objects on v16. However, the only action instance available is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action only moves the base of the robot and does not involve picking or placing any objects. Since there are no pick or place actions available, it is impossible to move the objects from their current locations to v16. Therefore, the goal is unreachable with the given actions.
