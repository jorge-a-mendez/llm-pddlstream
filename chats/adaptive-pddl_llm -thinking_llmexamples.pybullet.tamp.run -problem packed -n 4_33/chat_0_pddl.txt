           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of the Task**
           
           My objective is to achieve the goal of having objects v8, v12, v14, and v16 all placed "on" v18.  Breaking this down, this means I need to make sure each object is both "supported" by v18 and in the correct "atpose" (at a specific pose) relative to it.
           
           I'm starting with a situation where all four objects are currently "on" v11.  They're all "atpose" on some intermediary poses (v9, v13, v15, and v17, respectively) and "supported" by v11.  They're all stackable on both v18 and v10.
           
           My toolset is limited to a single allowed action instance: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This effectively does nothing except possibly toggle a "canmove" flag (which is initially set to false). I have no `pick`, `place`, `clean`, or `cook` actions at my disposal.
           
           To "pick" an object, I'd need to satisfy preconditions:
           *   Kinematic constraints (which I can't determine without the relevant continuous parameters)
           *   The object must be "atpose" (true in the initial state)
           *   The hand must be "handempty" (true in the initial state)
           *   The robot must be "atbconf" (true in the initial state)
           *   I must avoid "unsafeapproach" and "unsafeatraj" predicates (which I can't determine because I lack the continuous parameter information).
           
           To "place" an object, I'd need similar preconditions, but targeting v18 as the final supported object and a relevant pose.
           
           The critical issue is the lack of *any* `pick` or `place` action instances.  Because only `move_base` is available, I cannot alter the position of the objects. Since `move_base` is just moving the base from the same configuration, that doesn't help at all.  The goal, in its current state, is fundamentally unachievable. Without a way to lift and reposition the objects, I'm stuck. The `move_base` action is essentially irrelevant.
