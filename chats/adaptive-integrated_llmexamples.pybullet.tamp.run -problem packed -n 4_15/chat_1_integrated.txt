User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           #o1: object
           #o2: object

           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.077, 0.392), (0.174, 0.489)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.157, 0.273), (-0.062, 0.369)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.116, -0.418), (0.194, -0.34)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.125, 0.44, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.882, 0.471).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.202, 0.079), (0.279, 0.156)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.109, 0.321, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.864, 0.503).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.155, -0.379, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.751, 0.66).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.24, 0.118, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.744, 0.668).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is to place all four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) on object v18. Currently, all objects are supported on v11, which has AABB ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)). Object v18 has AABB ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). The robot is at base configuration v3 and arm configuration v5. It is holding nothing.
           
           Since there are no pick and place actions available in the provided action instances, and the goal requires moving objects, this problem cannot be solved. The `move_base` action is the only one available, but it does not change the state of objects in terms of their location.
           
           --Plan--:
           (move_base v3 v3 #o0)

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Fact is not satisfied: Atom on(v8, v18)`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The previous response incorrectly stated that there were no pick and place actions available. There are `kin` facts in the initial state that involve pick and place actions. However, the *only* action instance provided is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This means that `pick` and `place` actions, even though they exist in the domain, cannot be used because no valid instances are given.
           
           The goal is to have `on(v8, v18)`, `on(v12, v18)`, `on(v14, v18)`, and `on(v16, v18)`. All these predicates imply that objects need to be moved and placed. However, with only `move_base` as an available action instance, the robot cannot manipulate any objects. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
