           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable with Provided Actions**
           
           My analysis indicates that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently unachievable, and here's why. To achieve this goal, I need to satisfy several conditions, notably `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. To achieve these, I would need to employ `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, respectively. However, the problem statement explicitly restricts the available actions to only `move` and `drop_rock`. This is a crucial constraint. Since neither `send_image` nor `send_analysis` are permitted, there's no way to generate the necessary `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` facts within the given PDDL framework.  Even if continuous parameters were used, those have no impact as the underlying action instances that make this true are prohibited. Therefore, the defined goal is inherently unachievable within the confines of the provided action instance list.
