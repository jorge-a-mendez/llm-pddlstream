User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene contains a large central obstacle, likely defined by box 0, which is a square from -2.5 to 2.5 in both x and y. However, the subsequent boxes (1-4) define the outer boundaries of the environment, suggesting the robot is constrained within [-2.5, 2.5] in x and y. Box 5 is a vertical wall at x=0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered around, some near the edges and some more central. I will try to find positions for the robot within max_range=2 from the target point, avoiding these obstacles. I'll prioritize positions that are further away from known obstacles and provide a good viewing angle of the target.
           
           Positions:
           (-1.8 1.8)
           (-1.5 0.5)
           (1.5 0.5)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     The previous position (-1.8, 1.8) collided with obstacle 8, which is at ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)). This means the area around (-1.8, 1.8) is blocked. The position (-1.5, 0.5) had no line of sight to the target. This indicates there might be an obstacle between (-1.5, 0.5) and (0.51, 1.82). Given the target is (0.51, 1.82), which is in the upper right quadrant relative to the origin, positions to its right or slightly below it would be good. The vertical wall at x=0 (box 5) is a major obstacle to consider. I will try to place the robot in the right half of the scene, away from the left-side obstacles.
           
           Positions:
           (1.5 0.5)
           (0.5 0.0)
