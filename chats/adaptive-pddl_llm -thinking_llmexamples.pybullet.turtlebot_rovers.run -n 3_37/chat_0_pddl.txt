           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unachievable Goal in the Rovers Domain**
           
           Okay, I've analyzed the goal `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain.  It requires me to establish a series of `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates.  Initially, the system is in a state where I *can't* achieve those predicates.  I need to get images and analyses, which involves using actions like `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. However, the only actions I'm *allowed* to use are basically useless.
           
           I've carefully broken down the goal into its components: getting images for certain objectives (v17, v18, v19) in mode v11, and receiving analyses for all the soil and rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8). The only actions I can use involve moving the rovers between their current configuration and the *same* configuration, or dropping rocks (which requires the rovers to be *full* but they're *free* initially). 
           
           My analysis shows that I'm restricted to a set of valid action instances that only allow no-op actions!  This restriction directly contradicts the requirements of the goal.  I can't take images, I can't calibrate, I can't sample rocks, and I can't send anything.  This limitation means I can't generate the required `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           
           Therefore, given the constraints of only allowed actions, the goal is *unreachable*. It's impossible to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` conditions with the provided set of allowed actions. It's a clear case of a problem where the provided resources (allowed actions) are insufficient to reach the desired state.
