User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Here's how I'm thinking about this problem, and my proposed solution:**
           
           The goal is to find three valid (x, y) robot base positions near a target point, avoiding collisions and occlusions. The arena is defined by a central vertical wall and scattered obstacles. The tricky part is the target point itself: it's located at a corner of an obstacle, which presents a potential occlusion issue.
           
           My strategy involves these steps:
           
           1.  **Analyze the Scene:** I need to understand the fixed obstacles. The arena boundary, the central wall, and the scattered boxes are key. The crucial factor is the target point's position relative to these obstacles.
           2.  **Generate Candidate Positions:** I'll place candidate points on a circle with a radius slightly less than the maximum allowed range (2 units) around the target, and then adjust locations for collision-free points. I'll favor positions on the same side of the central wall as the target point. This usually yields the best sightlines.
           3.  **Check for Collisions:** I'll verify that each candidate position doesn't collide with any of the defined obstacles. Since the robot's size isn't given, I'm treating the robot as a single point, assuming that the provided AABBs account for the robot's size.
           4.  **Consider Line of Sight (LOS):** This is where it gets interesting. I need to make sure the robot has a clear line of sight to the target. I don't have a direct LOS function, so I'm primarily relying on placing the robot where I expect the line of sight to be clear based on the target position and avoiding collision. However, the feedback from an external system will have to validate the LOS.
           
           Given the target's location, my three suggested positions are:
           
           *   **P1:** (-1.9433, 2.4004) - Located slightly to the right and above the target.
           *   **P2:** (-0.1, 1.5) - Positioned far to the right of the target.
           *   **P3:** (-2.4, 1.0) - Positioned far to the left of the target.
           
           These positions are chosen to provide diverse viewpoints, avoid collisions, and (hopefully) provide clear lines of sight, considering the target's peculiar location within an obstacle. The final LOS validation will need to verify my strategy.
