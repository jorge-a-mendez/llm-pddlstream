(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for a Square Object**
           
           My task is to find 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 6, dimensions: 0.09899 x 0.09899) on a square surface (AABB: `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`). I need to determine the `surf_idx`, `theta`, `x`, and `y` coordinates for each placement, ensuring the object remains fully within the surface.
           
           First, I calculate the object's effective dimensions (AABB) when rotated. Since it's a square, when theta = 0 or multiples of pi/2, the object's dimensions are just its side length (0.099).  However, I need to account for rotation. When rotated by an angle `theta`, the effective AABB side length becomes `side_len * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. The maximum side length happens when `theta = pi/4` and equals approximately 0.14.
           
           To ensure the object fits inside the surface, the object's center `(x, y)` must lie within a smaller square.  The size of this smaller square depends on the rotation angle `theta`.
           
           Since I need 50 placements, I'll generate distinct rotation angles (`theta`) and for each `theta`, place the object's center at the center of the available area. For a symmetric surface and object, this is always the most stable configuration. I'll use 50 distinct angles evenly spaced from 0 to 2*pi.
           
           For each `theta`, I calculate the valid range for `x` and `y` and center the placement at `(0, 0)`. The logic behind this approach is as follows: given object is a square object and given the symmetric properties of the input surface, a 0-offset will yield the most stable placements.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed object ID 6 on surface 0, and now I need to figure out where to put object ID 4 on the same surface.  The key constraint is that object 4 can't collide with object 6.  I know object 6's size and position: it's a square, centered at (0, 0) with a side length of roughly 0.099. Object 4 is also a square, but smaller (side length around 0.079).  I need to find 50 different placements for it.
           
           The challenge is to *guarantee* no collision, and I know object 6's AABB is centered at (0,0) with dimensions s6 x s6. I know I have to avoid placing a new object within this AABB and given different theta rotations, I have to ensure object 4 doesn't collide with object 6.
           
           Let's break this down:
           
           1.  **AABB for Collision:** Object 6's AABB covers the region from approximately -0.049 to 0.049 in both x and y.  Object 4's AABB will change depending on the rotation (theta).  If theta is 0, the side length is 0.079, or 0.039604975 / 2.
           
           2.  **Surface Bounds:** I need to make sure the center of object 4 stays within the surface bounds (-0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y).
           
           3.  **Collision Avoidance (Key Logic):**
               *   To avoid collision, one of these conditions MUST be true.  In other words, the AABBs must *not* overlap:
                   *   Object 4's maximum x is less than Object 6's minimum x.
                   *   Object 4's minimum x is greater than Object 6's maximum x.
                   *   Object 4's maximum y is less than Object 6's minimum y.
                   *   Object 4's minimum y is greater than Object 6's maximum y.
           
           If theta is zero, I can just create placements on the corners of the object.  The best strategy seems to place object 4 at locations so that if a rotation is necessary, it can never collide. If I choose positions for a variety of `theta` values, it makes calculations far more complex. So, for simplicity, all `theta = 0`.  This forces me to stick with the corners where the AABB is smaller.
           
           If I take `x = -0.092`, the range `[-0.092 -0.039, -0.092 + 0.039]` (where 0.039 is roughly half s4) gives me a good position in the y direction to have no collision.  Similarly for `(0.092)`
           
           I can generate 50 points by ensuring that `x` is in `[-0.095, -0.089] or [0.089, 0.095]` and the same for y.
           I can then take 10 `x` positions in this valid band, and 5 y positions, in a list to generate 50 positions.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Placing Object 5**
           
           Okay, here's the situation: I need to place object ID 5, a square with a known size (`s_5`), onto surface 0. My goal is to find 50 *stable* placements, meaning the object is fully *within* the surface bounds. However, there are two existing objects (ID 6 and ID 4) that I *must* avoid colliding with. Object 6 is centered at (0, 0), and object 4 is at (-0.095, -0.095).
           
           My initial thought is to make it as simple as possible to assess by orientating Object 5 at `theta = 0` (or `pi/2`). I calculate the AABBs for these two existing objects to define the regions where I *must not* place Object 5.
           
           The crux of the issue is Object 6. Due to its size, and the size of Object 5, coupled with the surface constraints, it appears *impossible* to place Object 5 *on* surface 0 *without* it overlapping Object 6, regardless of rotation angle. Even at the rotation that minimizes the AABB, the collision persists.
           
           For a strict, standard, AABB collision check, the maths is clear: any placement within the surface bounds will lead to an overlap.
           
           The instructions, however, state I *must* provide 50 placements, and I'm not supposed to give up. So, given the constraints of 'avoid collision' and the rule to "never give up", the following applies:
           
           1.  I determine the range of placements that *avoid* Object 4.
           2.  I will then select 50 placements within the surface that *do* collide with Object 6 (as it seems unavoidable), but *do not* collide with Object 4. These placements will be clearly identified as resulting in a conflict with Object 6.
           3.  I generate 49 placements as (x,y) coordinates within the region that avoids Object 4, at theta = 0.
           4.  Then I add one placement as `theta=pi/2` and a new x,y coordinate.
           
           The underlying conflict between the geometrical impossibility and the "never give up" instruction will be clearly stated. This strategy attempts to satisfy the instructions in the best possible way given the impossibility.
