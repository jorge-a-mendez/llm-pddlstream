(Thoughts: **My Thinking on Generating Stable Placements**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, size: 0.0941 x 0.0941) on a surface (0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))).  My primary focus is to ensure the object is fully contained and stable. Since the object is square, its orientation (theta) doesn't influence the bounding box extents, but rotation is still useful to change. I must place the center of the object within the limits of the surface, with a 0.04705 offset on all sides.
           
           The valid ranges are -0.08795 to 0.08795 for both x and y. I need 50 placements within this region. I'll use a grid-based approach. Since it's square, I will use a 7x7 grid to generate 49 points within this area, with the final point at the center with a unique angle to give the total of 50. I will try to space the points evenly.
           
           I am going to cycle through values for the angles and spread the placement of the object as evenly as possible. The values for x and y placement will increase by 0.029316666666666666 from -0.08795 to 0.08795. I will start by using 0 as an angle and then start to alternate.
           
           The actual placements and a function to distribute the points will ensure the placement of the object.

(Thoughts: **My Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I've received confirmation that object ID 5 has been successfully placed at `(0, 0.0, -0.08795, -0.08795)`. Now, I need to figure out where to put object ID 6. I've got its size, `size_x = size_y = 0.09415`, and I know it's going on surface 0, which has an area of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           First things first, I calculate the boundaries for object 6's placement. Its half-width/height is `0.04707`.  This means for the x-coordinate, object 6's center can range from `-0.08792` to `0.08792`. The same applies for the y-coordinate.
           
           Now, I've got to consider object 5. Its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) sits at roughly `-0.08795, -0.08795` and has a size about the same as object 6. That's a square. I calculated object 5 to occupy approximately x=[-0.135, -0.0409], y=[-0.135, -0.0409]. I know where object 5 is and need to prevent overlaps.  I can visualize it being in the bottom-left corner of the surface.
           
           To avoid a collision I'm going to set it so that object 6 must go to the right of or above object 5. So, I will be calculating the AABB of object 5 and make sure I add a margin so that object 6 does not touch object 5. I will create a grid of points on the surface and filter any which would cause a collision.
           
           I had considered rotating object 6, which would affect its AABB. In this case, however, I am treating  `size_x` and `size_y` as fixed sizes for the AABB, regardless of `theta`. If `size_x` and `size_y` *were* for the rotated AABB, the numbers would look much more complicated, and the problem would not be as "simple" - so I will stick with the understanding that they are fixed.
           
           So, the simplest and most robust approach is to create a grid of potential center points for object 6.  I've decided on a 10x10 grid with points spread evenly across the usable area. I'll test each grid point to see if it causes a collision. This means calculating the coordinates of object 5's AABB (which can be reused, as it's not a lot of math) and checking that no part of object 6 (when AABB aligned) touches that AABB.
           
           Specifically: `(center_x + half_width) < min_x_5` OR `(center_x - half_width) > max_x_5`. The "OR" means "one or the other", and this will be checked against the y-coordinates as well.
           
           I generate 10 x 10 = 100 points, then filter out any grid point in the bottom-left which may cause a collision.  This will leave me with 50 coordinates, and I will be able to place 50 objects in total.  I will then start placing objects in order, choosing angles from `[0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2, pi/4, 3pi/4, 5pi/4, 7pi/4]` to change the orientation.

(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for Object 7**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to place this new object, ID 7, fifty times without it colliding with objects 5 and 6, all on Surface 0. I've broken this down into a few key steps.
           
           First, I need to understand the constraints: the dimensions of Object 7 (0.093788...), the size of Surface 0 (from -0.135 to 0.135), and the positions of the existing objects.  I've already calculated the half-extents for Object 7, which is basically half the object's width and height.
           
           Next, the math.  To avoid collisions, I need to make sure the bounding boxes of the objects don't overlap. I can create a safe placement region for object 7.  That means the center of Object 7 has to be a certain distance away from the edges of Surface 0 and the other objects. I've calculated the safe x and y ranges for Object 7, taking into account its half-extents and Surface 0's bounds. This gives me a "valid placement region".
           
           Now, for object 5, it is positioned at x = -0.08795, y = -0.08795.   And object 6, which is positioned at x = 0.0097694079611111, y = -0.08792467165. I've derived the minimum and maximum X and Y values for both of these objects' bounding boxes.
           
           By avoiding collisions with object 5, object 7 can avoid the region:  x < -0.08420005912 OR cy > 0.006044795.
           
           Finally, for object 6: the conditions are `cx7 < -0.08420006` OR `cy7 > 0.006044795`.
           
           Combining these constraints, the best approach seems to be to place Object 7 with its y-coordinate greater than 0.006044795.
           I've chosen 7 steps for x and y to get 49 placement positions on the surface that satisfy the conditions.
           Then a number of rotations to ensure diversity and complete the 50 desired placements.
