           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Action Restrictions**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with crafting a plan to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` goal, which boils down to obtaining images and analyses of certain rocks and soil samples.  I started by breaking down the goal into its components and checking the initial state. I quickly noticed that the state requires some specific predicates, like `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`, to be true.  These are currently FALSE.
           
           I then started outlining actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` that could potentially achieve these goals. Each of these actions has preconditions, which I meticulously examined. For instance, `take_image` requires `imagevisible`, `send_image` needs `comvisible`, and so on.
           
           The setup includes two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, and their respective configurations and components. I realized I needed the rovers to take images of specific "objectives" and analyze specific rocks and soil samples.  I identified the objects in my plan and began strategizing how to achieve `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`.
           
           This is where things got tricky. I knew I needed to use continuous configuration parameters like `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` to complete the plan.  The problem states that if the rover's config in the initial state is in `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicates, I have to provide a value. These continuous configurations are essential for the required actions like `take_image`. However, in the initial state, the rovers are configured at `v13` and `v15`, with the continuous configs only linked through `imagevisible` and `comvisible`.
           
           Then, I was given a list of allowed action *instances*, not just action types. This is a very specific restriction. The only permitted actions are self-motion `move` actions for the rovers and `drop_rock`. This means the rovers are essentially stuck in their current initial configurations and can't use any other action like `take_image`, or `sample_rock`, which would require a move.
           
           Consequently, I realized that given *only* the actions I'm allowed to use, there's no way to manipulate the state to satisfy the preconditions of the desired actions that would get me those analyses and images.  I can't take an image if I can't move to the necessary `#o` config. I can't analyze if I can't access them. And the only possible actions I'm given can't help me do any of that!
           
           Therefore, I've concluded that the `new-axiom@0()` goal is currently *unreachable* with the given allowed action instances. The rovers are effectively immobilized and cannot perform the tasks necessary to meet the goal.
