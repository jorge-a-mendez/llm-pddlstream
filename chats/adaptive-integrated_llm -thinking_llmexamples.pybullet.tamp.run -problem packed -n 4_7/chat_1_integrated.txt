User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.073, -0.372, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.572, 0.82).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.203, -0.471), (-0.128, -0.396)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.291, -0.287), (-0.195, -0.19)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.165, 0.227), (0.255, 0.317)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.028, -0.417), (0.118, -0.327)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.165, -0.433, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, 0.036).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.243, -0.238, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.962, 0.273).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.21, 0.272, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.573, 0.82).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've developed to achieve the goal state of placing objects v8, v12, v14, and v16 onto object v18:**
           
           My strategy involves using the robot's arm, v4, to pick each object from its initial position on surface v11 and subsequently place it onto v18. I'm leveraging the provided `kin` predicates to ensure each pick and place action is feasible. Since the robot's base will remain stationary (v3), all actions will occur with the base configuration v3.
           
           To manage the continuous poses, I'm taking the continuous pose `#o2` as a template. Since multiple objects need to be placed at a single target pose, I'm providing distinct continuous values for this pose to prevent overlaps between the objects. My calculations take the surface's dimensions (v18) and the object's initial positions into consideration, and I’m setting up a 2x2 arrangement of objects. The coordinate system for these objects will align with their respective bounding boxes. The target poses for the four objects, which are the continuous values I am providing, are:
           
           *   For object v8, its pose will be (0.05, -0.05, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   For object v12, its pose will be (0.05, 0.05, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   For object v14, its pose will be (-0.05, 0.05, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   For object v16, its pose will be (-0.05, -0.05, 0.781, 0.0)
           
           With the specified poses, this plan should be executable, as it addresses the core issue of preventing overlaps when multiple objects share a similar target pose. The planned actions ensure handempty and atgrasp predicates are managed correctly and can achieve the required goal.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Impossible Task**
           
           Okay, so the user has pointed out a critical flaw: all my proposed `pick` and `place` actions are invalid. The only action instance I'm allowed to use is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This is a huge problem. Essentially, the robot can only perform a meaningless base movement: going from `v3` to `v3` along trajectory `#o0`.
           
           The goal, as stated, is to get `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` all `on` `v18`.  Given my knowledge of the `on` axiom, I know that this translates to finding new poses for these objects where they are supported by `v18` and actually *at* that pose.
           
           Looking at the initial state, I see that these objects are currently at poses like `v9`, supported by `v11`. To achieve the goal, I would need to somehow change their support and pose to align with `v18`. Logically, this requires some form of manipulation: picking the objects up, moving them, and placing them on `v18`.
           
           But that's the rub!  I have no way to manipulate objects. The sole action available,  `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, doesn't touch the predicates that describe the objects' positions or support relationships.  It operates purely on the robot's base configuration.
           
           Therefore, considering the given initial state and the limited action available, the goal is simply unreachable.  I cannot possibly manipulate the objects' `atpose` and `supported` predicates with just a robot base movement. This is a dead end.
