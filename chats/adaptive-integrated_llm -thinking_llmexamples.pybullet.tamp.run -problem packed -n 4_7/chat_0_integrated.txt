User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object

           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.073, -0.372, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.572, 0.82).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.203, -0.471), (-0.128, -0.396)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.291, -0.287), (-0.195, -0.19)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.165, 0.227), (0.255, 0.317)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.028, -0.417), (0.118, -0.327)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.165, -0.433, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, 0.036).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.243, -0.238, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.962, 0.273).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.21, 0.272, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.573, 0.82).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Missing Preconditions**
           
           My task is to create a plan to move objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` from their current locations on surface `v11` to surface `v18`. This boils down to figuring out how to pick each object from `v11` and place them on `v18`. From the initial conditions and goal specification, this means finding suitable pose and support combinations to create the final state for all specified objects.
           
           I have to use the given actions, `move_base` at base conf. `v3`. It sounds like I'm supposed to come up with actions for the PR2 robot. I do have a grasp option, `#o1`, and my assumption is that I can use arm `v4`.
           
           I would typically employ `pick` and `place` actions to accomplish this. The initial setup includes the relevant `atpose`, `supported` facts, and the `on` relation (which is supported, pose). All the necessary information about surfaces and poses is available.
           
           However, there's a problem. The problem is framed in such a way that I *must* use what is provided. The rules specifically state I can only use actions from the given list, and that *any fact not explicitly stated is considered false*.
           
           The primary issue is the `kin` predicate.  It's a prerequisite for both `pick` and `place`, establishing the relationship between the arm, object, pose, grasp, base config, and trajectory.  Unfortunately, no such *kin* facts are given in the initial state. The given list of allowed *actions* is limited to `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.
           
           Without `kin` facts,  I cannot satisfy the preconditions for `pick` and `place`. The problem is that I cannot use these fundamental actions. The absence of `kin` means that, according to the problem's rules, it's impossible for me to move the objects to `v18`. Therefore, the goal state, as it's defined, is unachievable given the constraints of the problem.
