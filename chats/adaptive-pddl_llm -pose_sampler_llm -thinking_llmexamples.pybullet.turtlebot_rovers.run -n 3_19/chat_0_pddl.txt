User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Approach to Robot Base Position Planning**
           
           My task is to find three valid base positions for a robot, given a target point, within a maximum range of 2 units. The robot's orientation will automatically face the target. The main constraints are: (1) no collisions with fixed obstacles and (2) clear line-of-sight to the target.
           
           I began by meticulously analyzing the scene, which consists of a rectangular environment with walls, a central vertical pillar, and several smaller, irregularly shaped obstacles. Understanding the spatial layout and potential blockage points is crucial for effective position planning.
           
           My methodology involves a multi-pronged approach:
           
           1.  **Validity Conditions**: A successful base position must meet three criteria: (a) it must fall within the environment's boundaries, (b) it must be within a maximum range of 2 units from the target, and (c) it must not collide with any fixed obstacles. Additionally, there needs to be a clear line-of-sight to the target.
           
           2.  **Sampling and Line-of-Sight Checking**: I implemented functions to check for point-in-AABB (collision) and line-of-sight using the Liang-Barsky line-segment AABB intersection algorithm. For collision, I ensure the robot is *outside* the obstacle AABBs. For LOS, I check if the segment *strictly* intersects the AABBs.
           
           3.  **Candidate Position Generation**: To find a set of potentially valid base positions, I employed a multi-layered sampling strategy around the target.
               *   **Circular Sampling**: I sample points on circles of various radii centered at the target, varying the angles.
               *   **Grid Sampling**: Additionally, I use a square grid around the target to ensure the area is explored for all scenarios.
               *   **Iterative Density**: I begin with moderate sampling densities and increase them if not enough positions are found, increasing the chance of finding suitable locations.
           
           4.  **Collision and LOS Verification**:  For each candidate position, I check for environment boundaries, distance, and collision. If a position passes the criteria, I add it to the valid positions list and return the first three found.
           
           5.  **Handling Learning**: I have incorporated a basic way to store past failed positions for a given target for future scenarios, though this implementation is specific to a single request.  If I were to encounter the same target again in the future, the system could use the history to avoid suggesting previously failed areas.
           
           Overall, the strategy blends a sampling approach with obstacle awareness to efficiently find valid positions.
