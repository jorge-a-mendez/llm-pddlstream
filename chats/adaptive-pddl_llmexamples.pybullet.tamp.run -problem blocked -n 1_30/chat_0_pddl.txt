           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes several objects, `v15`, `v12`, and `v8`, which are all graspable and stackable. `v15` is currently at `pose v16` on `v11`. `v12` is at `pose v13` on `v14`. `v8` is at `pose v9` on `v11`. There are two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both are handempty and at their respective configurations. The robot's base is at `bconf v3`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be expanded using the axiom to `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. From the initial state, we know `type(v12, v17)` and `type(v8, v17)`, so `?green` could be either `v12` or `v8`. The goal then becomes to have either `v12` or `v8` on `v18`.
           
           Looking at the initial state, `v12` is supported by `v13` on `v14`, and `v8` is supported by `v9` on `v11`. We also have `stackable(v12, v18)` and `stackable(v8, v18)`. This means we can place `v12` or `v8` on `v18`.
           
           However, the only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not change the state of any object being on another object, nor does it affect their `type` or `cleaned` status. Therefore, the goal `on(?green, v18)` (where `?green` is `v12` or `v8`) cannot be achieved with the given actions. The initial state does not have `v12` or `v8` on `v18`.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable with the given action instances.
