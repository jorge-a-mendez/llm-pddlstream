           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single surface, surface 0, which is a rectangular area. The object is also rectangular with dimensions 0.07 x 0.07. I need to find 50 stable placements for this object on surface 0. A stable placement means the object is fully contained within the surface boundaries. Since the object is square, its orientation (theta) doesn't affect its bounding box, but I will still vary it for diversity.
           
           Surface 0: x from 4.2 to 4.8, y from -0.6 to 0.0.
           Object size: 0.07 x 0.07.
           
           To ensure the object is contained, for a given theta, I need to calculate the effective half-widths of the object.
           Let `w = object_size_x`, `h = object_size_y`.
           Effective half-width x' = `0.5 * (w * abs(cos(theta)) + h * abs(sin(theta)))`
           Effective half-width y' = `0.5 * (w * abs(sin(theta)) + h * abs(cos(theta)))`
           
           For the given object, `w = h = 0.07`.
           So, `x' = 0.5 * 0.07 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`
           `y' = 0.5 * 0.07 * (abs(sin(theta)) + abs(cos(theta)))`
           Since `w = h`, `x' = y'` for any `theta`.
           `max_half_extent = 0.5 * 0.07 * (sqrt(2))` at `theta = pi/4`.
           `min_half_extent = 0.5 * 0.07 * (1)` at `theta = 0` or `theta = pi/2`.
           `0.5 * 0.07 * sqrt(2) approx 0.049497`.
           `0.5 * 0.07 = 0.035`.
           
           So the object's effective half-width will always be between 0.035 and 0.0495.
           
           For surface 0:
           x_min = 4.2, x_max = 4.8. Available x range = 0.6.
           y_min = -0.6, y_max = 0.0. Available y range = 0.6.
           
           Center x must be between `x_min + x'` and `x_max - x'`.
           Center y must be between `y_min + y'` and `y_max - y'`.
           
           Let's use `x_half_extent = 0.035` and `y_half_extent = 0.035` as the object is square and I will use mostly 0 or pi/2 rotations.
           Center x: `4.2 + 0.035` to `4.8 - 0.035` -> `4.235` to `4.765`.
           Center y: `-0.6 + 0.035` to `0.0 - 0.035` -> `-0.565` to `-0.035`.
           
           I'll generate placements with varying x, y, and theta within these bounds.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I understand. The previous failures indicate that my calculations for the object's AABB when rotated by `pi/2` (1.5708 radians) were slightly off, specifically for the `x` and `y` center coordinates. The problem description states the object dimensions are `size_x` and `size_y` and implies an axis-aligned bounding box. When `theta = pi/2`, the `size_x` becomes the vertical extent and `size_y` becomes the horizontal extent. My initial interpretation of effective half-widths for a rotated square object was that it would always be `0.5 * side`. However, the feedback shows that when `theta = pi/2`, the `x` extent is still `size_x` and `y` extent is still `size_y` for the object's own local coordinate system, which means the AABB of the rotated object is still tied to the original `size_x` and `size_y` in the world frame, meaning my initial assumption that `x'` and `y'` effectively swapped or became `0.5 * (w * abs(cos(theta)) + h * abs(sin(theta)))` was incorrect for the definition of 'stable' used by the feedback system. It seems the system defines the AABB based on the object's `size_x` and `size_y` *regardless* of rotation, meaning `size_x` is always the horizontal extent and `size_y` is always the vertical extent. This simplifies things greatly.
           
           Let's re-evaluate:
           Object size: `size_x = 0.07`, `size_y = 0.07`.
           Half-width x = `0.07 / 2 = 0.035`.
           Half-width y = `0.07 / 2 = 0.035`.
           
           Surface 0: x from 4.2 to 4.8, y from -0.6 to 0.0.
           
           Center x must be between `x_min + half_width_x` and `x_max - half_width_x`.
           Center y must be between `y_min + half_width_y` and `y_max - half_width_y`.
           
           Center x: `4.2 + 0.035` to `4.8 - 0.035` -> `4.235` to `4.765`.
           Center y: `-0.6 + 0.035` to `0.0 - 0.035` -> `-0.565` to `-0.035`.
           
           My original calculations for `theta = 0` were correct. The failures for `theta = 1.5708` (pi/2) were because the `x` and `y` centers I chose were too close to the edge. The system seems to interpret `size_x` and `size_y` as *always* being the width and height of the object's AABB *in the world frame*, regardless of the `theta` value. This means `theta` only changes the visual orientation of the object, not its collision box. This is a crucial piece of information.
           
           The successes confirm that `theta = 0` placements with centers within `[4.235, 4.765]` for x and `[-0.565, -0.035]` for y are stable.
           The successes for `theta = 0.7854` also confirm that the AABB calculation for any `theta` is simply based on the initial `size_x` and `size_y` as fixed world-aligned extents. This simplifies the problem significantly: `theta` has no effect on stability, only on visual orientation.
           
           New object (ID: 10): `size_x = 0.09826826018926837`, `size_y = 0.09826826018926893`.
           Let's approximate: `size_x = 0.0983`, `size_y = 0.0983`.
           Half-width x = `0.0983 / 2 = 0.04915`.
           Half-width y = `0.0983 / 2 = 0.04915`.
           
           Surface 0: x from 4.2 to 4.8, y from -0.6 to 0.0.
           
           Center x must be between `x_min + half_width_x` and `x_max - half_width_x`.
           Center y must be between `y_min + half_width_y` and `y_max - half_width_y`.
           
           Center x: `4.2 + 0.04915` to `4.8 - 0.04915` -> `4.24915` to `4.75085`.
           Center y: `-0.6 + 0.04915` to `0.0 - 0.04915` -> `-0.55085` to `-0.04915`.
           
           I need to place object ID 10. I also need to ensure it doesn't collide with object ID 5.
           I have 10 successful placements for object 5. For simplicity, I'll pick one, say `(0, 0.0, 4.5, -0.3)`.
           This means object 5 occupies the AABB: `(4.5 - 0.035, -0.3 - 0.035)` to `(4.5 + 0.035, -0.3 + 0.035)`.
           Which is `(4.465, -0.335)` to `(4.535, -0.265)`.
           
           To avoid collision with this placed object 5, object 10's AABB must not overlap with `(4.465, -0.335)` to `(4.535, -0.265)`.
           Object 10's half-extents are `0.04915`.
           So, if object 10's center x is `Cx_10` and y is `Cy_10`:
           Object 10's AABB is `(Cx_10 - 0.04915, Cy_10 - 0.04915)` to `(Cx_10 + 0.04915, Cy_10 + 0.04915)`.
           
           I will place object 10 in various locations within the valid range, avoiding the AABB of object 5 at `(4.465, -0.335)` to `(4.535, -0.265)`.
           Valid x range for ID 10: `4.24915` to `4.75085`.
           Valid y range for ID 10: `-0.55085` to `-0.04915`.
           
           Collision check for object 10 with object 5 at `(4.5, -0.3)`:
           If `abs(Cx_10 - 4.5) < (0.04915 + 0.035)` AND `abs(Cy_10 - (-0.3)) < (0.04915 + 0.035)`, then there is a collision.
           `0.04915 + 0.035 = 0.08415`.
           So, avoid `Cx_10` in `(4.5 - 0.08415, 4.5 + 0.08415)` -> `(4.41585, 4.58415)`.
           And `Cy_10` in `(-0.3 - 0.08415, -0.3 + 0.08415)` -> `(-0.38415, -0.21585)`.
           
           This means I should pick centers for object 10 outside this box:
           x: `[4.24915, 4.41585)` and `(4.58415, 4.75085]`.
           y: `[-0.55085, -0.38415)` and `(-0.21585, -0.04915]`.
           
           I'll generate placements for ID 10, keeping in mind the no-collision constraint and the simplified AABB rule. I will vary theta for diversity, but it does not affect stability.
