(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation for Object ID 5**
           
           Alright, let's get this done. I need to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5) with dimensions approximately 0.089 x 0.089, which I'll call `obj_size_x` and `obj_size_y`. This object has to fit on surface 0, an AABB with extents ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). I'll call these limits `surf_0_min_x`, `surf_0_min_y`, `surf_0_max_x`, and `surf_0_max_y`.
           
           A placement is defined as `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`.  `surf_idx` is simply the surface index (0 in this case).  `theta` is the rotation in radians, and `(x, y)` is the center of the object's AABB.  For a stable placement, the object must be completely within the surface bounds.
           
           First, I need to understand how the object's bounding box changes with rotation. I know the rotated width and height can be calculated as: `rotated_obj_size_x = abs(obj_size_x * cos(theta)) + abs(obj_size_y * sin(theta))` and `rotated_obj_size_y = abs(obj_size_x * sin(theta)) + abs(obj_size_y * cos(theta))`. Since the object is basically a square, the effective dimensions after rotation will be equal and maximized at 45 degrees. Let's represent the original size `obj_size_x` and `obj_size_y` as `s`. The maximum rotated size can be calculated: `s * sqrt(2)`, which comes out to roughly 0.1258.
           
           The surface 0 has a width of 0.27, and a height of 0.27. Since the object's maximal size is 0.1258, it can definitely fit within the bounds.
           
           Now, for any `theta`, the rotated bounding box's center must satisfy these constraints: `-0.135 + rotated_half_dim <= x <= 0.135 - rotated_half_dim` and `-0.135 + rotated_half_dim <= y <= 0.135 - rotated_half_dim`, where `rotated_half_dim` is half the effective rotated width. This can be calculated as `0.5 * s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. I'll use 6 decimal places for precision.
           
           I'll generate 50 placements by varying `theta`, `x`, and `y`.  Since it's a square-like object and square surface, I know that the most restrictive angle is `pi/4`. The minimal `half_rotated_dim` (which occurs at `theta = 0` or `theta = pi/2`) is about 0.0445, and maximum value is `theta = pi/4` which is about 0.0629. I can select angles around these values: I will go with angles of 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, and pi/2. I'll take `num_steps = 4` to make the calculation less complex, which provides 16x 4 distinct x and y coordinates.
           
           For each angle, I will generate a set of  `(x, y)` coordinates, generating a grid. With that I will compute the actual locations, and combine them. Thus I will get 16 points for each angle. With `4 * 16 = 64` coordinates. Then I will select 50 of these coordinates. Thus I need to make sure that (0,0) is available in 2 of the final placements for the last 2 placements to bring the count of placements to 50 exactly. I could make 10 points per angle by adjusting a different step amount, in that event I should have 50.
           
           Let's do the math for the different angles:
           
           *   **theta = 0:** `half_rotated_dim = 0.044485`. Valid x and y range: [-0.090515, 0.090515]. Step: 0.060343
           *   **theta = pi/8:** `half_rotated_dim = 0.058098`. Valid x and y range: [-0

(Thoughts: **Finding Safe Placements for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed object 5, and now I need to figure out where to put object 6, ensuring it doesn't bump into the first object. Object 6 is basically a square with sides of length `0.0767`, and I have the surface bounds to work with, which are from `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`. I need to generate 50 valid placements for object 6 without overlaps.
           
           Object 5's position is important, as it's at `(-0.0905, -0.0905)`, and its size is `0.0889`. I calculate object 5's bounding box (AABB), `B_5`, and it turns out it's mostly in the lower-left corner of the surface. Knowing that object 5 is in the lower-left helps me plan where to place object 6.
           
           To account for rotation, I'll consider these angles: `0`, `pi/8`, `pi/4`, `3*pi/8`, and `pi/2`. First, I determine the half extent of the rotated object for each angle, which involves calculating half of the side length multiplied by the sum of absolute values of sine and cosine of the angle. I call this `h`. Then I determine the bounds of object 6's placement. For `theta = 0`, I determine that `h = 0.0383` and `x` and `y` range from `-0.0966` to `0.0966`, similar calculations for the other angles.
           
           Now, to prevent collisions, I will need to make sure the AABB of object 6 *does not* overlaps with `B_5`. The collision will occur when the AABB of object 6 overlaps with `B_5`. By using that logic, I need to ensure `(x+h) <= x_min_5` or `(x-h) >= x_max_5`. Basically, I ensure the objects don't touch by keeping object 6 either to the right of the existing object, or above.
           
           Finally, I generate 10 placements for each of the 5 angles, making a set of 50. I calculate the coordinates, filter them, and only keep locations that won't collide with object 5, and I keep enough samples for a good set of object locations. These will make great, collision-free locations for the next object.

(Thoughts: **Planning Placement of a New Object**
           
           My task is to place 50 stable instances of a new square object (ID 4) onto a 2D surface (surface 0) within specified bounds. The surface is a square centered at the origin, with sides of length 0.27. The object itself is also a square with a side length of approximately 0.099. Crucially, I must avoid collisions with two existing objects (IDs 5 and 6) already placed on the surface.
           
           To ensure stability, the object's center must be within a certain "safe zone" on the surface, accounting for its size and potential rotations. I’ll need to rotate it at several angles to attempt to place it. I will consider 5 different angles `0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2`. The existing objects are also squares. Object 5 has a side length of 0.089 and is located at (-0.091, -0.091), and Object 6 has a side length of 0.077 and is located at (-0.097, 0.002).
           
           To determine collision-free placements, I need to compute the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for each object. Since the object’s half-extent changes with the angle it is rotated, I will account for it to determine the safe placement ranges. My strategy is to first calculate the maximum extents of the surface in both axes. Then, I will adjust these extents to avoid collisions, taking into account the object's size and rotation. The object can safely sit within its bounds so long as a collision condition is not satisfied.
           
           For example, when the object is unrotated (angle 0), it can't occupy any part of either object's bounding box. For each of the angles, the placement bounds are the surface size bounds as well as the bounds that must be enforced due to a collision. After finding the collision constraint bounds, then I will identify "safe zones" where the object can be placed without intersecting.
           
           My strategy will be to subdivide these safe zones into sub-regions, placing a number of placements at each angle.
