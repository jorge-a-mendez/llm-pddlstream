           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Here's how I'm thinking about this task:**
           
           I need to find 50 stable placements for a square object (0.07 x 0.07) on a rectangular surface defined by the AABB `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. A stable placement means the object's AABB, *including its rotation*, must be entirely within the surface's AABB.  The placement is characterized by `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`, where `surf_idx` is the surface index (0 in this case), `theta` is the rotation angle, and `(x, y)` are the coordinates of the object's AABB center.
           
           First, I recognized that the object's dimensions are given by the dimensions of the object's axis aligned bounding box. When the object is rotated, I need to account for this change to its world-aligned bounding box.
           For a given rotation `theta`, I need to calculate the dimensions of the object's new AABB. These dimensions depend on the absolute values of the sine and cosine of `theta`.
           Since the object is square (and has equal x and y dimension), the rotated AABB is `hw_rotated = hh_rotated = 0.035 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.
           
           Based on the surface's dimensions (0.6 x 0.6), I've determined that there's plenty of space to place the object for any rotation; it's a small object on a relatively large surface.
           To generate 50 distinct placements, I'll strategically vary `theta`, `x`, and `y`.
           
           I'll iterate through five different `theta` values: `0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, pi/2`.  For each `theta`, I'll calculate the valid range for the object's center `(x, y)`. The valid ranges depend on `hw_rotated` and `hh_rotated`. Since there's ample space, I'll generate a grid of positions. For each rotation, I'll use 2 x-locations spaced in equal increments over the calculated valid range, and 5 y-locations, also spaced in equal increments.
           
           I confirmed that this approach will give me exactly 50 distinct placements because it is the multiplication of the number of theta values I will test (5), times 2 x-values, times 5 y-values.
           
           This provides a method to find a reasonable spread, considering that the dimensions will effectively be (0.07, 0.07) no matter the angle, since the object is square and only has (at most) sqrt(2) * 0.035 of AABB size difference, at an extreme of 45 degrees rotation.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 10**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new request for Object ID 10, a square with sides of approximately 0.09211.  I need to place this object on surface 0, which is defined by the coordinates ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  The critical thing to consider here is that I have to avoid collisions with the existing placement of Object ID 5 from the previous request. Object 5 is also a square with side length 0.07, and the successful placements for it are provided.  Essentially, the new challenge boils down to avoiding collision with a set of existing objects.
           
           First, I define the object's properties:  `size_x = size_y = 0.09211`, leading to a half-dimension of  0.046055.  I need to calculate potential placements that respect these dimensions and respect the surface limits.
           
           I've already calculated the AABBs for Object 5 at `theta = 0.0`. There are 10 of them: two columns of blocks at x=4.2865 and x=4.7135. Given their half extents of 0.035, the left-most is `[4.2515, 4.3215]`, the right-most is `[4.6785, 4.7485]`. The vertical range is, for this simplified representation, a series of vertically aligned blocks that are 0.035 tall, and separated vertically by 0.035 in the y direction.
           
           My strategy is to find a set of placements for Object 10 that won't collide with these AABBs. I'll initially consider `theta=0`, which aligns the edges with the axes. I know that since the object 10 is the same shape as object 5, i.e., square, the rotation does not impact our calculation or collision checks.
           
           I've calculated the x and y surface bounds for object 10. Given the surface and object's size, object 10 can range from x=4.246055 to x=4.753945 and from y=-0.553945 to y=-0.046055.
           
           Then I identified a *safe* x-range, a x-interval that doesn't overlap the range of the existing object.
           I analyze the horizontal space available for object 10.  Object 5 instances occupy parts of the horizontal space between 4.2515 and 4.3215, and between 4.6785 and 4.7485. This gives a range: [4.367555, 4.632445].
           In the y dimension, the available region is [-0.553945, -0.046055], which does not overlap the y-extent of Object 5 instances. Since object 5 has vertically aligned instances, this strategy will prevent any collisions.
           
           I will choose 5 points on the horizontal axis and 10 points on the vertical axis, giving us the requested 50, distinct, valid placements for object 10.
