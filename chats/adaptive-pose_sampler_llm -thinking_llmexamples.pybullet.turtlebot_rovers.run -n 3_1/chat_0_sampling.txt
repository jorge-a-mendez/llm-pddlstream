User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point.

           Okay, so I've got this task: I need to figure out 25 spots where a robot can stand to "view" a target.  I'm given the target's coordinates, some obstacles, and a distance limit. The trick is, I can't have any collisions, and the robot needs a clear line of sight to the target.
           
           Here's my thought process: First, I need to understand the constraints. The robot can't go outside a certain area (a square), and it has to be within a certain distance from the target. That defines a sort of "feasible region" – where the robot *could* be.
           
           Next, I look at the obstacles. I'm given the coordinates of these obstacles, like walls and boxes. My main concern is the big wall-like object smack in the middle (obstacle 5). Since the target is right *in* that wall, that means the target is part of the wall (or is very close to it), so the robot can stand anywhere around this wall as long as the base doesn't collide with any obstacles.
           
           My strategy is pretty simple. I'll make a grid across the feasible region and check each grid point. First, I check if it's within the distance limit and area restrictions.  Then, I check if it's inside an obstacle. And here's the key: if the target is inside an obstacle, that obstacle is considered part of the *target object*, not an occluder. So, I only need to ensure the robot doesn't collide with any other obstacles.
           
           I'm starting with a relatively coarse grid to quickly find spots. If I don't find enough positions that way, I'll switch to a finer grid.  I need to get 25 spots that are collision-free and (as close as possible) without any line-of-sight issues for the given scenario. If I get stuck later, I'll refine it with more complex line of sight calculations, as I'm guaranteed to eventually find good locations. I also think I may need to take into account the "smallness" of the target point. But since there are no clear line-of-sight constraints, for the first pass I am just checking collisions.
