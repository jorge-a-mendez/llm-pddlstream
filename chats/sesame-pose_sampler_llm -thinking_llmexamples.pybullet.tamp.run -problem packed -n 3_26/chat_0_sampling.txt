(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 4**
           
           Alright, let's get this done. The goal is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 4, which has dimensions of approximately 0.087 x 0.087, on surface 0, a 0.27 x 0.27 square centered at the origin. I'm leveraging my knowledge of AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) calculations for this.
           
           First, I need to understand that the object's stability hinges on its AABB remaining entirely within the surface's AABB.  This means calculating how the object's effective dimensions change with rotation (theta). The general formula for a rotated AABB is `rotated_w = obj_w * abs(cos(theta)) + obj_h * abs(sin(theta))` and the same for height. Given that the object is nearly square, its rotated dimensions will be fairly constant, which simplifies the calculations somewhat.
           
           The key is to explore different values of `theta` and their corresponding valid ranges for `x` and `y` (the center coordinates).  I'll generate a diverse set of placements by sampling `theta` values evenly distributed between 0 and 2*pi, calculating the rotated AABB, and then generating a grid of valid (x, y) coordinates within the surface's bounds for each theta.
           
           I've decided to use 10 theta values, spaced evenly, and for each `theta`, I'll generate 5 `(x, y)` pairs. This ensures a total of 50 placements.  I'll calculate the valid ranges for x and y for each `theta`, ensuring the rotated AABB fits within the surface limits. It seems straightforward, and this should give me the 50 placements I need, covering the space nicely.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed object 4, and now I need to figure out where to put object 5 without any collisions. Object 5 is almost square, but a bit bigger than object 4, and they're both going on surface 0. My goal is to find 50 stable placements. I know the position and dimensions of object 4, which helps me determine a safe zone.
           
           First, I've got to calculate the AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) of object 4, based on its current position. I will do the same for all the theta and x,y placements I decide to explore.
           
           Then, for object 5, I'll consider 10 different rotation angles and generate a grid of x,y positions for each. To avoid collisions, I'll use a conservative AABB check: if object 5's AABB at a given position overlaps object 4's AABB, that position is discarded. The idea is to create a valid range of points, and test if the placements are valid, and add if no collisions are detected.
           
           Since object 5 is nearly square, I can calculate its minimum and maximum rotated dimensions. The valid range for x and y centers will be a function of the valid bounds of the surface, and the rotated width/height of the object. I have to avoid placement in the range of the object 4. I need to make sure I get a good variety of placements and no collisions.
           
           I'll refine the process by generating points within valid intervals (surface boundaries, and no collisions), and then filter the placements. I'll make sure there is no collision or overlap of the bounding box.

(Thoughts: **The Goal: Place a New Object Securely**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for a new object (ID 6) on surface 0, while carefully avoiding collisions with two existing, fixed obstacles (ID 4 and ID 5). I've already calculated the boundaries of surface 0 and the bounding boxes of the existing objects, including their x and y ranges.
           
           **Collision Avoidance is Key**
           
           To succeed, I'll need to strategically position the new object. I will analyze the valid x and y ranges to make sure it doesn't touch the fixed obstacles. The key is in determining the allowed space by calculating the boundary zones. To check collision: the rotated AABB must **not** overlap with the AABBs of objects 4 and 5. This will be done with an `epsilon` to guarantee separation.
           
           I'm prepared to handle rotations, calculating the new object's rotated size based on the rotation angle. Then, I must determine the feasible space for the object's center point, making sure it doesn't extend beyond the surface boundaries, and crucially, keeping it safely away from the existing objects.
           
           I will iterate through rotation angles (10 are chosen), calculating the rotated object's bounding box and finding its x and y valid ranges. I will sample a discrete grid in the feasible space. I will be checking for overlap with objects 4 and 5, using my accurate collision check function. The collision check will employ epsilon buffer to ensure a small gap. Once 50 valid placements are found, the search can stop.
