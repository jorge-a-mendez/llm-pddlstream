User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Generating Robot Base Positions**
           
           The objective is to find three valid (x, y) coordinates for a robot base relative to a given target point. These positions must be within 2 meters of the target, and the robot's orientation will automatically be set to face the target. The overall environment restricts positions to the range of x and y, both from -2.5 to 2.5. The main challenge is to identify valid positions, meaning those that don't collide with any fixed obstacles. These fixed obstacles are described as a list of Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs).
           
           My approach focuses on creating a reliable method to find and return three valid positions, assuming this is a "new request" for the target point. This lets me focus on the fixed obstacles and environment limits.
           
           To do this, I break the process into smaller, manageable steps. First, I need to analyze the fixed obstacle configuration to develop an understanding of the accessible space. Then, I generate candidate positions near the target point. Finally, I will check each candidate against the validity criteria, which are: 1. Is the position within the environment limits? 2. Is the position within 2 meters of the target point? 3. Does the position collide with any fixed obstacle?
           
           For the first step, I am able to identify the fixed obstacles and understand their arrangement. Most notable is the presence of the central vertical wall (obstacle 5) at x=0. This presents a considerable barrier. If the target point lies on one side of this wall, the robot will generally prefer to be on the same side, unless the target is close to the wall.
           
           The process of generating candidate positions includes an initial structured search. I aim for diversity by generating points at various distances and angles from the target. The points will be generated using a set of distances and angles (in degrees, for example, 0, 45, 90, 135 degrees), using both distances and the chosen set of angles. Points very close to the target are also added to the list. I also use a secondary approach. A grid-based approach with smaller steps is employed if not enough candidates are found.
           
           I prioritize positions that give a good line of sight to the target and remain clear of any fixed obstacles. The key obstacle is the central vertical wall which divides the search area into two halves.
           
           Positions:
           (0.5, 0.5)
           (0.05, 0.05)
           (1.0, 1.0)

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Okay, let's break down this complex situation. I've been given feedback that previous attempts to position the robot near target point `(-0.5809, 2.1548)` failed.** The main issue, I believe, is that the target point is *actually inside* a known obstacle (`Obstacle 10`), specifically the square defined by `((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))`. This means any position offering a direct line of sight from outside will likely be blocked by that obstacle.
           
           **Here's the problem I'm seeing and the strategy I've formulated:**
           
           *   **Collision Detection:** My initial collision check might have a flaw, or perhaps I'm not fully accounting for a circular robot base, requiring adjustments based on the collision reports. Although a radius wasn't explicitly mentioned, I'm now assuming a robot radius of 0.05 meters.
           *   **Target in Obstacle:** The critical realization is that the target is inside a known obstacle. Therefore, I need to choose positions *very close* to the edges of this obstacle (in this case, `Obstacle 10`) to have any chance of a clear line of sight. Being within the obstacle itself prevents a clear view from all sides.
           *   **Previous Failures:** The provided feedback on failed positions (`(-0.7397, 0.9922)`, `(0.4042, 0.7071)`, and `(0.046, 0.999)`) confirms this occlusion concept, and the collision reports now make more sense. My checks show that the reported collissions are correct. The collision detection logic could need refinement.
           
           **My Plan for finding a suitable position is now adjusted:**
           
           1.  **Strict Avoidance:** I'll steer clear of any region that the feedback indicated as a problematic zone.
           2.  **Obstacle Proximity:** I will propose positions immediately adjacent to the boundaries of `Obstacle 10`. I'll try to find a position that's not occluded by this obstacle.
           3.  **Conservative Checks:** I will also use a conservative collision check, that explicitly consider the `ROBOT_RADIUS` of `0.05m`.
           4.  **Target Proximity:** Finally, I'll propose different positions that are "near" the boundary of Obstacle 10. And I'll attempt them from various positions along the edge of this obstacle to allow the maximum coverage.
           
           **Given the above, I'm proposing the following positions:**
           
           *   `(-0.19, 2.1548)`: Positioned to the *right* of `Obstacle 10`, sharing the same y-coordinate as the target.
           *   `(-0.81, 2.1548)`: Positioned to the *left* of `Obstacle 10`, also sharing the same y-coordinate as the target.
           *   `(-0.4272, 1.69)`: Positioned *below* `Obstacle 10`.
           *   `(-0.5809, 2.31)`: Positioned *above* `Obstacle 10`.
           
           These positions are designed to get close to the target from four directions, while minimizing obstruction. I'll be more confident if they all work to give the best chance of visibility.
