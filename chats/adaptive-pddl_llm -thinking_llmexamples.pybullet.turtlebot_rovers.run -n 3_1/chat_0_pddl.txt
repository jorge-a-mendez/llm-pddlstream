           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable with Restricted Actions**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with devising a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`.  This boils down to achieving a set of facts related to receiving images and analyses of rocks and soil.  I see that I need to establish three `receivedimage` predicates with different objective and mode arguments and at least one `receivedanalysis` predicate for both a stone and soil type. The initial state provides crucial facts about the current configurations of rovers and the types of rocks and soil present. However, I have noticed that the actions permitted are only 'move' and 'drop_rock' actions.
           
           The challenge is to achieve `receivedimage` which is only possible with `send_image`. The precondition of `send_image` leads to `take_image`, `calibrate`, which are not valid actions. Similarly, achieving the `receivedanalysis` requires `send_analysis`, which is also not allowed.
           
           This leads me to a fundamental problem: the actions available ('move' and 'drop_rock') cannot establish the required predicates for `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`. The only option would be if the initial state already satisfied these conditions. But they don't. Given that the only actions I can use are those listed, it's logically impossible to achieve the target state. The goal is, therefore, unreachable within the constraints.
