(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation for Square Object**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 8, dimensions approximately 0.095 x 0.095) on a square surface (surface 0, defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`). Being the expert I am, I recognize this is a classic constrained placement problem.
           
           Since the object and the surface are both squares, orientation (`theta`) technically doesn't impact the bounding box's stability. However, to inject some diversity as requested, I'll still vary `theta` between 0 and π/2.
           
           First, I need to figure out the valid range for the object's center (x, y) coordinates within surface 0.  The object's AABB must fit inside the surface's AABB. Therefore, the object's half-side length (0.0475) determines the valid center range. This gives a range from -0.087 to 0.087 for both x and y.
           
           To get the 50 placements, I'll generate a 5x5 grid of (x, y) coordinates within this valid range. Then, for each grid point, I'll create two placements: one with `theta = 0` and the other with `theta = π/2`. This will ensure I get 50 unique placements (5 * 5 * 2 = 50).
           
           Here's the plan:
           
           1.  Calculate the valid x and y ranges: `[-0.087479019458152, 0.087479019458152]`
           2.  Divide this range into 5 steps, calculate x and y grid points.
           3.  For each (x, y) point, create two placements, one with `theta=0` and one with `theta=π/2`.
           4.  That should do it. Let me generate those coordinates now...

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Placing Object 7**
           
           Okay, I've successfully placed Object 8, and now it's time to place Object 7 on Surface 0. My primary goals are stability and, critically, avoiding any collisions with Object 8. I've already calculated the valid ranges for Object 7's center based on the surface dimensions and object extents. Object 7 is a square with half-extents of approximately 0.0398, so its center must be within the x and y ranges of roughly [-0.0952, 0.0952] to remain on the surface.
           
           Now, I have to account for the presence of Object 8. Object 8 is snugly positioned in the bottom-left corner of the surface with an AABB from [-0.135, -0.03995] for both x and y.
           
           To avoid collision, I need to ensure that Object 7's AABB doesn't overlap with Object 8's. Considering the dimensions, the easiest way is to position Object 7 primarily in the top-right quadrant of the surface. Specifically, if both `xc7` and `yc7` (the center coordinates of Object 7) are greater than or equal to -0.000168, there will be no collision.
           
           Therefore, for this task, I will create a grid of 5x5 points within the [0.0, 0.0952] range for both x and y. I will choose x and y coordinates from `0.0`, `0.0238`, `0.0476`, `0.0714`, and `0.0952` and apply two rotations, 0 and pi/2, for each. This will give me a total of 25 grid points * 2 rotations = 50 placements of Object 7 that I can be confident will be collision-free.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object 5: A Detailed Plan for Avoiding Collisions**
           
           Alright, let's break this down systematically. My goal is to find 50 stable placements for Object 5 (a square of size `0.07172983987233639 x 0.07172983987233639`) on Surface 0 (`((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`), avoiding collisions with the existing objects: Object 8 (bottom-left) and Object 7 (centered).
           
           First, I established the valid *x* and *y* range for Object 5's center, constrained by the surface boundaries. This yields an initial range of `-0.0991350800638318` to `0.0991350800638318` for both *x* and *y*.
           
           Now, the collision avoidance is critical. I've calculated the AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) for Objects 7 and 8 to identify collision-free zones. Object 8's AABB is  `[-0.135, -0.039958038916304]` x `[-0.135, -0.039958038916304]` and Object 7's AABB is `[-0.03979059727669332, 0.03979059727669332]` x `[-0.03979059727669332, 0.03979059727669332]`.
           
           After visualizing the space, I quickly realized the existing objects form an "L"-shape. Object 8 is in the bottom-left, Object 7 in the center, leaving available the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right corner.
           
           I quickly determined the safe zones. By calculating that I could place 9 (x,y) positions in each of the three corner zones with two rotations, I could meet the 50 desired placements.
           
           Here's my calculated solution, with 3 zones:
           *   **Zone 1: Top-Right Corner:** Coordinates for *x* are `0.07565551721286151`, `0.08739529863834665`, and `0.0991350800638318`. Coordinates for *y* are `0.07565551721286151`, `0.08739529863834665`, and `0.0991350800638318`.
           *   **Zone 2: Top-Left Corner:** Coordinates for *x* are `-0.0991350800638318`, `-0.08739529863834666`, and `-0.07565551721286151`. Coordinates for *y* are `0.07565551721286151`, `0.08739529863834665`, and `0.0991350800638318`.
           *   **Zone 3: Bottom-Right Corner:** Coordinates for *x* are `0.07565551721286151`, `0.08739529863834665`, and `0.0991350800638318`. Coordinates for *y* are `-0.0991350800638318`, `-0.08739529863834666`, and `-0.07565551721286151`.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a new square-like object (ID 6) on a surface (Surface 0). This surface is a square bounded by AABB `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I need to ensure these placements are within the surface's boundaries and, critically, don't collide with the existing objects: Object ID 8, Object ID 7, and Object ID 5. This is a packing problem with collision detection and placement stability as key constraints.
           
           **Scene Geometry and Constraints**
           
           I've got the surface defined as a square of side length 0.27, centered at (0, 0).  Object 6 is effectively a square with a bit of imprecision. The object dimensions will be considered as if they are a perfect square.  The surface's boundaries limit where I can place the object. I need to calculate the safe space for the object's center based on object dimensions and existing object positions. Existing objects' extents and placements are:
           
           *   **Object ID 8:** Located in the bottom-left corner with extents `(0.095, 0.095)`.
           *   **Object ID 7:** Centered at (0, 0) with extents `(0.07958, 0.07958)`.
           *   **Object ID 5:** In the top-right corner, offset with extents `(0.07172, 0.07172)`.
           
           I'll be using axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) for collision checking because it simplifies the calculations.
           
           **Collision Avoidance and AABB Calculations**
           
           The core of the problem is collision detection.  I need to ensure no overlap between ID 6's AABB and the AABBs of the other three objects.  To ensure these non-overlapping states, for any coordinate `x_c` or `y_c` of object center, I will calculate ranges of object center coordinates that avoid each object individually: if `x_c + h6 > C8_xmin` and `x_c - h6 < C8_xmax`, I have a collision and must shift coordinates.
           
           Object 6 will have half-extents  `h6` based on the largest of its `x` and `y` extents.
           
           **Placement Strategy: Iterative Approach with Point Sampling**
           
           Since analytical methods for complex packing problems can get challenging, I'm going to take a brute-force approach. I'll define an even grid (for x and y-coordinates) inside the valid surface, with spacing based on h6. For each point in this grid, the AABB of ID 6 will be generated, and then collisions with AABBs for IDs 8, 7, and 5 will be checked. If no collisions are present, the placement is valid.
           I will verify this numerically by sampling the area for 50 non-colliding locations within the defined surface.
           
           I've set the grid size to 6 x 6 for the x and y coordinates respectively which should generate sufficiently many points. The generated list will be truncated to include just 50, in the event there're enough non-colliding locations to make this possible.
           
           **Detailed Calculations and Verification**
           
           I will be carefully defining all AABBs and checking the boundary intersections to guarantee these conditions:
           
           *   The generated placements are fully inside the surface.
           *   The generated placements are fully outside of ID 8, 7, and 5.
           
           I will verify the code and the placements by generating a sample list and manually checking.

           *   **Object ID 8:** Located in the bottom-left corner with extents `(0.095, 0.095)`.
           *   **Object ID 7:** Centered at (0, 0) with extents `(0.07958, 0.07958)`.
           *   **Object ID 5:** In the top-right corner, offset with extents `(0.07172, 0.07172)`.
           
           I'll be using axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) for collision checking because it simplifies the calculations.
           
           **Collision Avoidance and AABB Calculations**
           
           The core of the problem is collision detection.  I need to ensure no overlap between ID 6's AABB and the AABBs of the other three objects.  To ensure these non-overlapping states, for any coordinate `x_c` or `y_c` of object center, I will calculate ranges of object center coordinates that avoid each object individually: if `x_c + h6 > C8_xmin` and `x_c - h6 < C8_xmax`, I have a collision and must shift coordinates.
           
           Object 6 will have half-extents  `h6` based on the largest of its `x` and `y` extents.
           
           **Placement Strategy: Iterative Approach with Point Sampling**
           
           Since analytical methods for complex packing problems can get challenging, I'm going to take a brute-force approach. I'll define an even grid (for x and y-coordinates) inside the valid surface, with spacing based on h6. For each point in this grid, the AABB of ID 6 will be generated, and then collisions with AABBs for IDs 8, 7, and 5 will be checked. If no collisions are present, the placement is valid.
           I will verify this numerically by sampling the area for 50 non-colliding locations within the defined surface.
           
           I've set the grid size to 6 x 6 for the x and y coordinates respectively which should generate sufficiently many points. The generated list will be truncated to include just 50, in the event there're enough non-colliding locations to make this possible.
           
           **Detailed Calculations and Verification**
           
           I will be carefully defining all AABBs and checking the boundary intersections to guarantee these conditions:
           
           *   The generated placements are fully inside the surface.
           *   The generated placements are fully outside of ID 8, 7, and 5.
           
           I will verify the code and the placements by generating a sample list and manually checking.
