           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation for Object 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out how to place this little square object (ID 5, dimensions 0.07 x 0.07) stably on a given surface (Surface 0, an AABB from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0)) a total of 50 times.  "Stably" means the object has to be completely inside the surface's boundaries. Since it's a square, its rotation (theta) is going to be interesting to calculate.
           
           First, the geometry: Surface 0 is a rectangle, 0.6 units wide (x-axis) and 0.6 units tall (y-axis). The object is a square. Easy enough. To figure out stable positions, I need to make sure the object's center point is far enough from the edges of the surface.
           
           If I set theta to 0 or any multiple of pi/2, the square's AABB will just be 0.07 x 0.07 and the constraints are pretty simple.  x can be from 4.235 to 4.765 and y can be from -0.565 to -0.035. Using those parameters I calculated 25 different (x,y) coordinates within this area. Then I created a new grid of coordinates for theta = pi/4 to take into consideration the rotation of the square.
           
           For the rotations I picked, I should have a good spread over the surface. The main thing is that all those placements must be within the correct bounding box I have now established for different rotations. So my approach is: 25 at `theta = 0` and 25 with `theta = pi/4`.
