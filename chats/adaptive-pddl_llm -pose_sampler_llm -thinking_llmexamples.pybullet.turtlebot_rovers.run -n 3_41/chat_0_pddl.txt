           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching the Unreachable: A Configuration Conundrum**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is `new-axiom@0()`, which boils down to achieving a set of conditions, specifically getting images and analyses. The initial state analysis seems straightforward, with the first four conditions already met. However, the crux of the problem lies in the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. To achieve those, I need the "take_image" and "send_image" actions. These actions have a critical precondition: the rover must be at the correct *configuration* to interact with the target objects for imaging and analysis.
           
           I've got two rovers, v12 and v14. Each rover has specific configurations (v13 for v12 and v15 for v14) based on their `atconf` facts.  Crucially, the actions required have preconditions requiring `atconf(rover, target-configuration)`.  I checked the image and communication visibility facts (like `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`), which imply the rovers need to be at configurations `#o3`, `#o0` or `#o5` for them to 'see'. However, my 'move' actions - the only way to move - *don't actually move the rover*. They simply restate the current configuration, essentially saying 'stay put'.
           
           Here's the problem: I've got a visibility and communication requirements that are at different configurations from the rovers' current location and there are no actions to move them to the required locations.  So, I can't meet the preconditions for taking or sending images. Also, I don't see any means for sampling rock or soils to send those to the lander. With this severe configuration mismatch and the lack of move actions to fix it, it's clear these key goal predicates remain unattainable and I can't get past that.  It's a deadlock scenario: my plan is blocked by the inability to change configurations.  Therefore, the overall goal of `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable with the current state and available actions.
