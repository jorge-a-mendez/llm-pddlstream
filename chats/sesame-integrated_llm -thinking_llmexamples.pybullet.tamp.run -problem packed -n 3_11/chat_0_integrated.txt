           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.189, -0.35, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.921, -0.389).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.004, -0.487, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.251, 0.968).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.027, 0.277), (0.12, 0.369)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.139, -0.4), (0.238, -0.301)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.043, -0.535), (0.052, -0.439)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.074, 0.323, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.977, -0.213).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **The Core Strategy: A Detailed Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan: I need to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all situated on `v16`. They're currently spread out on `v11`.  My brain starts by seeing the initial conditions: all three objects sitting pretty on `v11`. The robots are ready, with two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both hands currently empty. The base is configured at `v3`.
           
           My primary aim is to get these objects on `v16`. Since all objects have to be *placed* on that surface and the prompt states, with a bit of a twist, that when the goals uses the same continuous parameter `#o2`, it has to be interpreted in a unique manner per object. I'll need to define different coordinates for `#o2` for `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`. I start with actions *pick* and *place*, since it's clear these are the core actions. Arm `v4` will be doing the heavy lifting here.
           
           So the plan needs to be broken down: 
           1. Get the robot base to the right position. (Likely to a configuration `#o3` so I can reach the objects).
           2. For each object: pick it up from its current spot.
           3. Place it down, precisely on `v16`.
           
           The given actions point to using the continuous variable `#o3` for picking and placing, and it seems this is going to be a key position. So it's best to move the base there first.
           
           Let's dive into the specifics:
           
           **The Movement and Grasping**
           
           First, I'll *move_base* from `v3` to `#o3`. Then the fun begins:
           
           1.  *Pick* `v8` from its pose, which is given by `atpose(v8, v9)`. 
           2.  *Place* `v8` onto a specific spot on `v16`.  This is where I'll use those custom `#o2` values I mentioned earlier.
           3.  *Pick* `v12` from its place, which is given by `atpose(v12, v13)`. 
           4.  *Place* `v12` onto `v16` (different `#o2` value).
           5.  *Pick* `v14` from its place, which is given by `atpose(v14, v15)`. 
           6.  *Place* `v14` onto `v16` (another unique `#o2` value).
           
           **Ensuring Collision-Free Placements**
           
           The challenge is to make sure these *places* are collision-free. I have to think about the object's size and where it's already sitting, as well as the initial conditions like the known coordinates and the table configuration. Let me make sure I do not make any mistakes here: I'll need to set different coordinates. I'm choosing coordinates for the `#o2` placements that avoid overlapping!
           
           **Putting It All Together**
           
           The core steps:
           
           1.  *move_base* v3 #o3 #o0 (to be able to pick from the start).
           2.  *pick* `v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           3.  *place* `v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           4.  *pick* `v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           5.  *place* `v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           6.  *pick* `v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           7.  *place* `v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           
           **Final Check and Thoughts**
           
           Assuming that "safety" conditions like `unsafepose` and `unsafeapproach` are FALSE (the default, as I did not get any info here), this all looks good. The cost will be the *move_base* cost from `v3` to `#o3` plus 3 * (pick_cost + place_cost). Since the goal does not require returning base to original pose, I should not need to.  I'm ready to roll!
