(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation for Object ID 5**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, square dimensions 0.098 x 0.098) on a single surface (AABB: (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135)).  The key is that since the object is square, its bounding box doesn't change with rotation. This significantly simplifies the problem.
           
           First, I calculate the valid range for the object's center (x, y) on the surface, ensuring the bounding box remains within the surface's boundaries.  The valid x and y range are symmetrically bounded around zero.
           
           Next, I generate 49 placements using a 7x7 grid of x and y coordinates within the valid ranges, all with a rotation of 0.  This covers the surface space evenly.
           
           Finally, for diversity, I add a 50th placement at the center of the surface with a rotation of π/4.  Although the rotation doesn't change the object's bounding box, this introduces a bit of angular variation. The problem is now completely solved.

(Thoughts: **Collision-Aware Object Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback that object ID 5 has been successfully placed in the scene, which means it’s now a fixed obstacle. My task is to determine a safe, collision-free location for object ID 4. This requires careful consideration of object ID 5's position, properties, and the surface constraints.
           
           My analysis started by establishing object ID 5's AABB using the provided data (surf_idx, theta, x, y, and size_x, size_y). Knowing that object 5's AABB is approximately square allows for straightforward calculations of its minimum and maximum x and y coordinates. Specifically:
           *   Its center is located at `-0.0860029936722526, -0.0860029936722526`.
           *   Its AABB goes from `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(-0.037005987344505205, -0.037005987344505205)`.
           
           Next, I determined the AABB for object ID 4, which is also almost square. With a theta of 0, the object’s half-extents are easy to calculate. 
           
           Then I defined the surface boundaries. The surface has boundaries `surf_lx = -0.135`, `surf_ux = 0.135`, `surf_ly = -0.135`, and `surf_uy = 0.135`. With the surface properties and object ID 4 dimensions, it was possible to work out the area of valid placement. The area available for object 4 is limited by the bounds of the surface and any overlap by object 5.
           
           Given the goal of no collision, I had to ensure that object 4’s AABB does not overlap with that of object 5. Several key conditions for non-overlapping were considered:
           *   `x4 + h_x4 <= min_x5` OR `x4 - h_x4 >= max_x5`
           *   `y4 + h_y4 <= min_y5` OR `y4 - h_y4 >= max_y5`
           Since both objects are square and have rotation `theta = 0`, I simplified this to placing `(x4, y4)` where `cx < -0.037005... - 0.046876...` or `cy < -0.037005... - 0.046876...`.
           In the real code, these tests will likely be axis aligned bounding boxes. In this simplified version, I can just use a test for proximity to other objects.
           
           To find appropriate placements, I used a grid-based approach. The area that did not have collision was a 10x10 space. In that space, I used a set of simple filters to ensure that the centers of object 4 did not fall into an overlapping area. Based on this, I had identified that I would need 64 candidate (x,y) locations. The code showed that the actual number was 55 points. Because the model of the real geometry is approximate, I will provide the script's output. The 55 points, all with `theta = 0`, should allow for object ID 4 placement in a safe, collision-free zone.

(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Non-Colliding Placements for Object 6**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. I need to place 50 copies of Object 6 (a square, about 0.096 units on each side) onto Surface 0, which is a square region of size 0.27 units centered at (0,0). I need to make sure none of these placements collide with each other or two existing objects: Object 5 and Object 4.  I'm going to keep things simple and just orient Object 6 at `theta = 0` (no rotation) for all placements.
           
           First, I calculated the half-extents of Object 6, which are each roughly 0.048 units. Then I defined the boundaries for placing it on the surface by calculating the minimum and maximum center positions for Object 6 so it stays within the surface bounds.
           
           Next, I need to prevent collisions. I calculated the AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) for Object 5 and Object 4. These are essentially the rectangular spaces they occupy. Then I used these bounding boxes to efficiently check for any overlap between a potential placement of Object 6 and the two obstacles.
           
           To generate a starting set of placements, I created a grid of potential center points for Object 6 within the allowed surface area. I used a 10x10 grid, so that gives me 100 potential points initially. I calculated the step size for the x and y coordinates to create evenly spaced placements. Then I calculated the AABB for each potential Object 6 center and checked for overlap with the AABBs of Objects 4 and 5. If there's no overlap, then the potential placement is valid.
           
           I realized that there might be areas where collisions were inevitable due to where Object 5 and 4 are located. So I went through and analyzed where the collisions would most likely be. I found out that the first four columns and the lower part of the grid have collisions with objects 4 and 5. This means I would have to start placing Object 6 at `x` center greater than `0.0096` to be collision free with all existing objects. So I modified my selection by avoiding the blocked region on the grid, from the top left corner.
           In doing so, I found a good 50 placements of `theta = 0`. The resulting coordinates are `cx`, and `cy` values.
