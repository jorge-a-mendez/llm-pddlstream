           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.118, 0.467, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.799, 0.601).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).

           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.136, -0.533, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.026, 1.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.011, -0.266, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.116, 0.993).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes four graspable objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) currently on a surface (v11) and the goal is to place all of them on another surface (v18). The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, but only v4 is relevant for the provided actions. The robot is currently at base configuration v3 and arm configuration v5 for arm v4. The actions available are `move_base`, `pick`, and `place`. All `pick` and `place` actions involve arm v4, grasp #o1, and base configuration #o3 (which needs to be computed or is just a placeholder to indicate that the base will move, but the actual base config used in the action is derived from #o3, which is linked to v3). The poses of the objects are v9 for v8, v13 for v12, v15 for v14, and v17 for v16. All objects are supported on v11 at their current poses. The target surface is v18 for all objects.
           
           The task is to move all four objects to surface v18. Since the goal requires all objects to be on v18, and `on` is an axiom of `supported` and `atpose`, we need to place each object at a pose that is supported by v18. The initial state provides the predicate `pose(obj, #o2)` with `supported(obj, #o2, v18)` for all objects v8, v12, v14, and v16. This means we need to pick each object from its initial pose and place it at #o2, providing a unique continuous value for #o2 for each object.
           
           The plan involves picking up each object from its initial pose using arm v4, and then placing it at a new pose (#o2) on surface v18. This needs to be done for all four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16). Since the `kin` predicates indicate that the robot needs to be at base config #o3 to perform the pick and place, and the robot is currently at v3, a `move_base` action might be required. However, the initial state includes `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)` and `basemotion(#o3, #o0, #o3)` and `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)` and `basemotion(#o3, #o0, v3)`, which implies that #o3 is essentially the same as v3 or a base configuration close to v3 that can be reached with minimal or zero cost using #o0 (a trivial motion trajectory). Given that all `pick` and `place` actions are available with #o3, and the robot is at v3, and `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)` exists, it means the robot is effectively in a position to perform these actions or can move to #o3 with zero cost. So, we do not need to explicitly call `move_base` to get to #o3 from v3. We can just assume #o3 is equivalent to v3 in terms of location or easily reachable without additional cost.
           
           The plan sequence will be:
           1. Pick v8 from v9.
           2. Place v8 at #o2 on v18.
           3. Pick v12 from v13.
           4. Place v12 at #o2 on v18.
           5. Pick v14 from v15.
           6. Place v14 at #o2 on v18.
           7. Pick v16 from v17.
           8. Place v16 at #o2 on v18.
           
           For each placement, we need to provide a unique value for #o2 on the v18 surface. We will assume that v18 is a table and the objects can be placed next to each other.

           1. Pick v8 from v9.
           2. Place v8 at #o2 on v18.
           3. Pick v12 from v13.
           4. Place v12 at #o2 on v18.
           5. Pick v14 from v15.
           6. Place v14 at #o2 on v18.
           7. Pick v16 from v17.
           8. Place v16 at #o2 on v18.
           
           For each placement, we need to provide a unique value for #o2 on the v18 surface. We need to ensure the AABBs of the objects are contained within the AABB of surface v18: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). The objects are small, let's try to place them in a grid pattern.
           
           v8 has AABB ((0.193, -0.194), (0.276, -0.11))
           v12 has AABB ((-0.162, 0.423), (-0.075, 0.51))
           v14 has AABB ((-0.053, -0.308), (0.031, -0.224))
           v16 has AABB ((-0.173, -0.57), (-0.099, -0.496))
           
           These AABBs are for the *objects themselves*, not for their bounding box when placed at a given pose. The problem states that the AABB for v18 is ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). This is likely the AABB of the surface, not necessarily the AABB of the objects. We will place the objects using their *relative* dimensions. The previous error message indicates that the *object's* AABB when placed at the new pose, needs to be contained within the surface's AABB. Assuming a generic small object size, let's target center coordinates within the surface bounds. The origin of the object's AABB is assumed to be its center. Let's try placing them close to the center of v18.
           The AABB of v18 is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           For object v8, let's assume it has some width and length. Let's place its center at (-0.08, 0.08).
           For object v12, let's place its center at (0.08, 0.08).
           For object v14, let's place its center at (-0.08, -0.08).
           For object v16, let's place its center at (0.08, -0.08).
           The z-coordinate for all objects should be the same, 0.781, as that is the height of the surface where objects are initially placed.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', v39) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The scene describes four graspable objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) currently on a surface (v11) and the goal is to place all of them on another surface (v18). The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, but only v4 is relevant for the provided actions. The robot is currently at base configuration v3 and arm configuration v5 for arm v4. The actions available are `move_base`, `pick`, and `place`. All `pick` and `place` actions involve arm v4, grasp #o1, and base configuration #o3. The poses of the objects are v9 for v8, v13 for v12, v15 for v14, and v17 for v16. All objects are supported on v11 at their current poses. The target surface is v18 for all objects.
           
           The task is to move all four objects to surface v18. Since the goal requires all objects to be on v18, and `on` is an axiom of `supported` and `atpose`, we need to place each object at a pose that is supported by v18. The initial state provides the predicate `pose(obj, #o2)` with `supported(obj, #o2, v18)` for all objects v8, v12, v14, and v16. This means we need to pick each object from its initial pose and place it at #o2, providing a unique continuous value for #o2 for each object.
           
           The previous plan failed because `atbconf(v39)` was not satisfied. This indicates that the base configuration #o3 (which was used in the `kin` and `basemotion` predicates) is not directly equivalent to v3, and a `move_base` action *is* required to reach #o3 before performing the `pick` and `place` actions.
           
           The initial state has `atbconf(v3)` and `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)` and `basemotion(#o3, #o0, v3)`. This means we can move from v3 to #o3 using trajectory #o0. After performing `pick` or `place`, the robot gains `canmove()`, which allows it to `move_base` again.
           
           So the corrected plan will be:
           1. Move the base from v3 to #o3.
           2. Pick v8 from v9.
           3. Place v8 at #o2 on v18.
           4. Pick v12 from v13.
           5. Place v12 at #o2 on v18.
           6. Pick v14 from v15.
           7. Place v14 at #o2 on v18.
           8. Pick v16 from v17.
           9. Place v16 at #o2 on v18.
           
           We will keep the same placement poses from the previous attempt, as the previous error was a precondition failure, not a stability failure. The AABB of v18 is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
