           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v20)
               Atom on(v12, v20)
               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of the Goal State**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to get `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` all *on* `v20`.  From my knowledge, the `on` predicate hinges on the `supported` and `atpose` predicates. Specifically, an object is *on* another if it's both *supported* by it at a particular pose, and *at* that pose.  So, I need to find the correct pose for each of those five objects such that they are supported by `v20` and then, of course, place them at those poses.
           
           Looking at the initial state, all five objects are on `v11`. Now, I have information indicating where they *should* go, namely pose `#o2`. This is where `supported(object, #o2, v20)` and therefore `on(object, v20)` should be true.  So, I need to place each object at pose `#o2` on top of `v20`.
           
           The relevant actions at my disposal, based on the problem, are `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`. Given that the goal only involves the `on` predicate, cleaning and cooking actions are immediately irrelevant. My strategy here is a simple "pick and place."
           
           But, here's the catch: I've only been given one single action instance - `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. The prompt explicitly states that *only* the actions listed can be used. This immediately flags a huge problem, the list of *allowed* actions is a crucial constraint. It effectively means I can *only* move the base, and I can't interact with the objects directly at all. Since I'm missing `pick` and `place` instances, I can't move the objects!
           
           This renders the goal unattainable. I cannot, under the given constraint of only being able to `move_base`, change the objects' positions from `v11` to `v20`. I need `pick` and `place` to manipulate the objects and achieve the `on` predicate. I need to be able to pick each object from `v11`, and then place it onto `v20` using their correct poses at `#o2`. I can't do any of that, the goal is impossible to reach with the provided action instances.
