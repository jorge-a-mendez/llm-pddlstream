           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Alright, the task is clear: I need to devise a plan to move the objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` onto object `v20`. The initial state has them all on `v11`.  The key here is the `on` predicate, which depends on `supported` (the object is supported by another object) and `atpose` (the object is at a specific pose).  I've got the initial states figured out, all the objects are on `v11`, right now, which are:
           * `on(v14, v11)`
           * `on(v8, v11)`
           * `on(v18, v11)`
           * `on(v12, v11)`
           * `on(v16, v11)`
           
           The method to achieve the goal appears to be a sequence of `pick` and `place` actions, using arm `v4`.  The facts point to `#o2` as a viable pose to place all these objects on `v20`.
           
           **Plan Development and Action Breakdown (Initially)**
           
           My initial plan was to use a simple sequence, moving the objects one by one: `pick` the object from its current location, and `place` it onto `v20` at pose `#o2`. I saw that there are supporting facts for `v20` holding these objects on `#o2`, so it seemed straight-forward.
           
           **Crucial Constraint: Allowed Actions**
           
           Here's the problem: The prompt states that I can ONLY use the actions given in the provided list. The list ONLY contains  `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This means that I can NOT use `pick` or `place` at all. This is a very restrictive constraint that changes everything.
           
           **Conclusion: Goal is Unreachable**
           
           Since `pick` and `place` are not allowed, there is no way to physically move the target objects from their current locations on `v11` to the desired location, `v20`.  The given `move_base` action doesn't accomplish anything useful in the given context (since it's a null operation). Consequently, based on the provided constraints, the goal is unreachable.
