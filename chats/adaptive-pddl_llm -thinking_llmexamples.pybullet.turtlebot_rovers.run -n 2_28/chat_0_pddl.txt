           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unachievable with Provided Actions**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with the goal of achieving `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom boils down to four subgoals that need to be true: two `receivedimage` predicates and two `receivedanalysis` predicates.  I've thoroughly dissected the preconditions for each of these.  The key is to understand how I can make `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` true.
           
           My analysis reveals that to get `receivedimage(objective, mode)` I need a chain: `calibrate`, `take_image`, and `send_image`.  To get `receivedanalysis` I need to analyze both a stone and soil. I know from the initial state what objects are the stone, and what objects are soil.
           
           The major problem arises with the actions I'm *allowed* to use: `move` and `drop_rock`. Neither of those can do the necessary `calibrate`, `take_image`, or `send_image` actions. Even if I could *use* those actions, the problem is that calibrating the camera is an atomic state, and those actions are not designed to re-calibrate, they *un-calibrate*. This means I need to calibrate for *every* image.
           
           The `move` action primarily changes `atconf`, and the `drop_rock` action modifies `free` and `full`. This is a big red flag - neither of these even touch `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           
           Therefore, I've concluded that, given the available actions, achieving the `new-axiom@0()` goal is impossible. I lack the necessary tools to perform the core functions required. The problem boils down to a fundamental lack of *appropriate* actions for image and analysis-related tasks. I'd need other actions, not available, to make this work.
