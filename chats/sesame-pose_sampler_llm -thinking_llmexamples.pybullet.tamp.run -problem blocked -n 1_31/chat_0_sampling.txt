(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My primary goal is to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, dimensions 0.07 x 0.07) on surface 0, an AABB defined by ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)). I'm treating `obj_w` and `obj_h` (0.07, 0.07) as the dimensions of the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB). My starting point is that for each placement I'll define a (surf_idx, theta, x, y) tuple.
           
           A key constraint is that the object must remain entirely within the surface bounds.  Since there are no other objects or obstacles, collisions aren't a concern right now. However, I must consider the object's rotation (theta). The effective AABB dimension changes with rotation. I calculate this as `effective_dim = 0.07 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This means the dimensions will range from 0.07 to 0.07 * sqrt(2), or approximately 0.099.
           
           I need the object AABB to fit inside the surface's AABB. Since the object's effective dimensions is at most 0.099 and the surface has dimensions 0.6x0.6, it will fit easily. I need to make sure the object's center remains within surface bounds to prevent an edge-overlapping situation. I'll need to calculate a new valid range for x and y.
           
           My core strategy is to systematically vary the object's orientation (theta) and its center coordinates (x, y).  I'll sample theta with a few angles, while generating a 2x5 grid or 5x2 grid of placements for each theta in order to get a spread of the objects placements across the valid region of the surface.  This results in 5 angles * 10 points per angle or approximately 50 placements. I chose these angles: `0`, `pi/8`, `pi/4`, `3*pi/8`, `pi/2`.
           The key is calculating the appropriate range of possible (x, y) given the effective bounding box of the object when rotated by the sampled theta. I carefully determined what the new bounds on x and y should be for each value of theta, making sure there is no edge overlapping.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement for Object ID 10: A Deep Dive into Collision Avoidance and Stable Positioning**
           
           Right, let's break down this placement problem systematically. I've got a new object, ID 10, that needs to be positioned stably on surface 0. My key constraints are: 1) the object must remain *fully* within the surface bounds, and 2) it *cannot* collide with any of the previously placed instances of object ID 5.
           
           First, I analyze the successful placements of object 5.  These instances are square objects (approximately 0.07 x 0.07) placed with *theta = 0* along two parallel strips at the top and bottom of the surface.  These two strips cover the surface almost entirely.
           
           The surface 0 has the shape `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. This means the surface is bounded in x from 4.2 to 4.8 and in y from -0.6 to 0.0.
           
           Now, object 10 is also a square, with side approximately 0.0892. This presents a challenge:  I need to find *50* safe placements, and this is harder given the constraints. The successful placements of Object 5, essentially, occupy most of the surface.
           
           To position object 10, the most efficient approach is to choose the correct location for the center (x, y) given the orientation (theta). Here's how I think about it.
           
           *   **Theta:** First, I'll need to figure out which angles are feasible. This will also change the placement strategy.
           
           *   **Calculate allowable space**: Given the constraints, what's my available "no-fly zone"? Considering object 5 has occupied a portion of the surface, I can't put Object 10 there. I need to take into account the size and orientation (theta) of object 10. For each theta value, the space will be different. For the purposes of computation, I should be able to identify 5 possible angles.
           
           *   **Y-Range Avoidance**: Calculate the collision regions in the y-axis, given the y-axis center ranges of object 5.
           
           *   **X-Range Calculation**: Knowing my allowable y-range, figure out the x-axis range for each given theta.
           
           *   **X, Y Center Generation**: Given the allowed x, y ranges, create an x,y grid, and then generate the placement points. For 50 total points, I'll allocate placements across various possible angles.
           
           Given these considerations, I'll generate the placement points for object 10 that satisfy the requirements!
