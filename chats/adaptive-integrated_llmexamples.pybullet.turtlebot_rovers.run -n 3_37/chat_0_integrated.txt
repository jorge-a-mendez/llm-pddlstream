           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks us to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom representing a complex goal. Let's break down `new-axiom@0()` into its components:
           
           ```
           Axiom new-axiom@0()
             Conjunction
               Atom atconf(v12, v13)
               Atom atconf(v14, v15)
               Atom free(v12, v16)
               Atom free(v14, v16)
               Atom receivedimage(v17, v11)
               Atom receivedimage(v18, v11)
               Atom receivedimage(v19, v11)
               Atom type(?stone, v2)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?stone)
               Atom type(?soil, v6)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?soil)
           ```
           
           From the initial state:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` is true.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)` is true.
           - `free(v12, v16)` is true.
           - `free(v14, v16)` is true.
           
           This means we only need to achieve:
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for all rocks of type `v2`
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for all rocks of type `v6`
           
           Let's identify the rocks and their types:
           Rocks of type `v2` (stone): `v3`, `v1`, `v4`
           Rocks of type `v6` (soil): `v5`, `v7`, `v8`
           
           So the goal simplifies to:
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           - `receivedanalysis(v3)`
           - `receivedanalysis(v1)`
           - `receivedanalysis(v4)`
           - `receivedanalysis(v5)`
           - `receivedanalysis(v7)`
           - `receivedanalysis(v8)`
           
           We have two rovers: `v12` and `v14`. Both rovers are at their respective initial configurations (`v13` and `v15`). Both have camera `v10` onboard which supports mode `v11`. Both have `v16` as a storage. Both are free of full stores.
           
           Let's focus on `receivedimage` first. To achieve `receivedimage(?o, ?m)`, we need `take_image` and then `send_image`.
           The preconditions for `take_image(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o, ?c, ?m)` are:
           - `imagevisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o)`: We have `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, and the same for `v14`.
           - `onboard(?c, ?v)`: `onboard(v10, v12)` and `onboard(v10, v14)` are true.
           - `supports(?c, ?m)`: `supports(v10, v11)` is true.
           - `atconf(?v, ?q)`: This means `?q` must be the current configuration of the rover. Both `v13` and `v15` are current configurations. The configurations `#o3` must be reachable and collision-free.
           - `calibrated(?c, ?v)`: This must be achieved by `calibrate`.
           - `~blocked(?y)`: This means `~test-cfree-ray-conf-negative(?y, ?v, ?q)`. The rays for image visibility are `#o4`.
           
           The preconditions for `send_image(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l, ?o, ?m)` are:
           - `comvisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l)`: We have `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`.
           - `objective(?o)`: `v17`, `v18`, `v19` are objectives.
           - `mode(?m)`: `v11` is a mode.
           - `haveimage(?v, ?o, ?m)`: This is the effect of `take_image`.
           - `atconf(?v, ?q)`: This means `?q` must be the current configuration of the rover. The configurations `#o0` must be reachable and collision-free.
           - `~blocked(?y)`: This means `~test-cfree-ray-conf-negative(?y, ?v, ?q)`. The rays for communication visibility are `#o1`.
           
           Let's use `v12` to take and send images.
           1. `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)` (assuming `#o3` is a good config for `v12` to see `v17`).
           2. `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`
           3. `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)` (assuming `#o0` is a good config for `v12` to communicate with `v9`).
           This will achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)`.
           Since `calibrate` makes the camera uncalibrated again, we need to calibrate again for each image, or strategically group the `take_image` actions. However, the action `calibrate` has `imagevisible` in its precondition, so it effectively means calibrating for a specific image, and then `take_image` will invalidate that calibration. So we need to calibrate for each image.
           
           Alternatively, we can calibrate once if the imagevisible predicate allows for multiple objects from the same configuration. In this domain, `imagevisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o)` means the rover `?v` at configuration `?q` can see objective `?o` through ray `?y`. The calibration action takes `?o` as an argument. So it means the camera is calibrated for that specific objective `?o`. So we need to calibrate for each objective.
           
           Let's consider using `v12` for `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           To get `receivedimage(v17, v11)`:
           1. `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)`
           2. `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`
           3. `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`
           
           To get `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           4. `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v18, v10)`
           5. `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`
           6. `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`
           
           To get `receivedimage(v19, v11)`:
           7. `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v19, v10)`
           8. `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v19, v10, v11)`
           9. `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v19, v11)`
           
           Now for `receivedanalysis(?r)` for all rocks.
           The preconditions for `sample_rock(?v, ?q, ?r, ?s)`:
           - `above(?v, ?q, ?r)`: We have `above(v12, #o5, v8)`, `above(v12, #o5, v3)`, `above(v12, #o5, v5)`, `above(v12, #o5, v4)`, `above(v12, #o5, v7)`, `above(v12, #o5, v1)`. And similarly for `v14`.
           - `store(?s)`: `v16` is a store.
           - `atconf(?v, ?q)`: `?q` must be the current configuration of the rover. `#o5` must be reachable and collision-free.
           - `free(?v, ?s)`: `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true.
           
           The preconditions for `send_analysis(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l, ?r)` are:
           - `comvisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l)`: Same as `send_image`.
           - `rock(?r)`: All our targets are rocks.
           - `analyzed(?v, ?r)`: This is the effect of `sample_rock`.
           - `atconf(?v, ?q)`: Same as `send_image`.
           - `~blocked(?y)`: Same as `send_image`.
           
           Let's use `v14` for sampling and sending analysis.
           Rocks to analyze: `v3`, `v1`, `v4` (type v2) and `v5`, `v7`, `v8` (type v6).
           `v14` can access all of them from `#o5`.
           `v14` has `v16` as a store and it is free.
           
           To get `receivedanalysis(v3)`:
           10. `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v3, v16)`
           11. `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v3)`
           
           To get `receivedanalysis(v1)`:
           12. `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v1, v16)`
           13. `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v1)`
           
           To get `receivedanalysis(v4)`:
           14. `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v4, v16)`
           15. `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v4)`
           
           To get `receivedanalysis(v5)`:
           16. `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v5, v16)`
           17. `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v5)`
           
           To get `receivedanalysis(v7)`:
           18. `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v7, v16)`
           19. `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v7)`
           
           To get `receivedanalysis(v8)`:
           20. `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v8, v16)`
           21. `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v8)`
           
           There's a problem: `sample_rock` makes the store `full(?v, ?s)` and `~free(?v, ?s)`. So after the first `sample_rock`, the store `v16` on `v14` will be full, and subsequent `sample_rock` actions will fail their `free(?v, ?s)` precondition. We need to `drop_rock` to make the store free again.
           
           Let's refine the plan, making sure to drop rocks between samples. Since `v14` is the rover, and `v16` is the store, we need to use `drop_rock(v14, v16)`.
           
           Revised analysis plan for `v14`:
           `free(v14, v16)` is true initially.
           For `v3`:
           10. `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v3, v16)` (store becomes full)
           11. `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v3)`
           12. `drop_rock(v14, v16)` (store becomes free again)
           
           For `v1`:

           14. `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v1)`
           15. `drop_rock(v14, v16)` (store becomes free again)
           
           For `v4`:
           16. `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v4, v16)` (store becomes full)
           17. `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v4)`
           18. `drop_rock(v14, v16)` (store becomes free again)
           
           For `v5`:

           20. `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v5)`
           21. `drop_rock(v14, v16)` (store becomes free again)
           
           For `v7`:

           23. `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v7)`
           24. `drop_rock(v14, v16)` (store becomes free again)
           
           For `v8`:

           26. `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v8)`
           27. `drop_rock(v14, v16)` (store becomes free again)
           
           The given action instances only include `move` and `drop_rock` for existing configurations. All `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions must use the configurations with `#` prefix. This means we have to provide continuous values for them.
           
           Since the problem states that `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` etc. are already in the initial state, we just need to specify the continuous values for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`. Since both rovers have `conf(rover, #name)` in the initial state for the same `#name` values, we need to specify separate continuous values for each rover if they are used by that rover. The problem also states "If your plan uses some object #<name> ... such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration".
           
           For `#o0` (comvisible):
           `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`.
           Since `v9` is the lander, and the rovers are `v12` and `v14`, and both are at their respective base configurations `v13` and `v15`, we can choose a config close to `v13` for `v12` to communicate with `v9`, and close to `v15` for `v14` to communicate with `v9`.
           `v13` is (1.0, -1.75). `v15` is (-1.0, -1.75). `v9` (lander) is at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
           Let's choose `(0.0, -1.75)` for `#o0` for `v12` to communicate with `v9`. Distance to `v9` is roughly `sqrt((-2 - 0)^2 + (-2 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(4 + 0.0625) = sqrt(4.0625) ~ 2.01`. This is within 4.
           Let's choose `(-1.0, -1.75)` for `#o0` for `v14` to communicate with `v9`. Distance to `v9` is roughly `sqrt((-2 - (-1))^2 + (-2 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(1 + 0.0625) = sqrt(1.0625) ~ 1.03`. This is within 4.
           
           For `#o3` (imagevisible):
           `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`.
           `v17` is at `((0.374, 1.814), (0.472, 1.913))`.
           `v19` is at `((-1.886, 1.883), (-1.787, 1.981))`.
           `v18` is at `((-0.459, 1.875), (-0.366, 1.968))`.
           Rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           For `v12` to see `v17` (around (0.42, 1.86)): A config around `(0.7, 1.8)` could work. Distance to `v17` is about `sqrt((0.42-0.7)^2 + (1.86-1.8)^2) = sqrt(0.0784 + 0.0036) = sqrt(0.082) ~ 0.28`. This is within 2.
           For `v12` to see `v19` (around (-1.83, 1.93)): A config around `(0.7, 1.8)` is too far. Distance is `sqrt((-1.83 - 0.7)^2 + (1.93 - 1.8)^2) = sqrt(6.4 + 0.0169) > 2`. So `v12` cannot see `v19` from this config.
           For `v12` to see `v18` (around (-0.41, 1.92)): A config around `(0.7, 1.8)` is too far. Distance is `sqrt((-0.41 - 0.7)^2 + (1.92 - 1.8)^2) = sqrt(1.23 + 0.0144) ~ 1.11`. This is within 2.
           
           Let's use `v14` for `v19` and `v18`, since it starts at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75), which is closer to them.
           For `v14` to see `v19`: A config near `(-1.5, 1.8)` could work. Distance to `v19` is about `sqrt((-1.83 - (-1.5))^2 + (1.93 - 1.8)^2) = sqrt(0.1089 + 0.0169) = sqrt(0.1258) ~ 0.35`. Within 2.
           For `v14` to see `v18`: A config near `(-0.4, 1.8)` could work. Distance to `v18` is about `sqrt((-0.41 - (-0.4))^2 + (1.92 - 1.8)^2) = sqrt(0.0001 + 0.0144) = sqrt(0.0145) ~ 0.12`. Within 2.
           
           We need different configurations if a rover is used for different image visible objects. This is critical.
           So, let's designate specific configurations for specific (rover, target) pairs, even if they share the same `#o3` configuration name in the initial state. The problem explicitly states this.
           
           Let's rename the `#` configs for clarity in the plan, even though the problem description implies a single value for `#o0`, `#o1` etc. but then also says "you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair". This means we must specify the configuration name, rover name, and target object name.
           
           For `imagevisible`:
           `#o3_v12_v17`: for `v12` to image `v17`. `v17` is around (0.42, 1.86). `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). A configuration like `(0.7, 1.0)` for `v12` to image `v17`. Distance `sqrt((0.42-0.7)^2+(1.86-1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.0784+0.7396) = sqrt(0.818) ~ 0.9`. Within 2.
           `#o3_v14_v19`: for `v14` to image `v19`. `v19` is around (-1.83, 1.93). `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). A configuration like `(-1.5, 1.0)` for `v14` to image `v19`. Distance `sqrt((-1.83-(-1.5))^2+(1.93-1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.1089+0.8649) = sqrt(0.9738) ~ 0.98`. Within 2.
           `#o3_v14_v18`: for `v14` to image `v18`. `v18` is around (-0.41, 1.92). `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). A configuration like `(-0.7, 1.0)` for `v14` to image `v18`. Distance `sqrt((-0.41-(-0.7))^2+(1.92-1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.0841+0.8464) = sqrt(0.9305) ~ 0.96`. Within 2.
           
           For `comvisible`:
           `#o0_v12_v9`: for `v12` to communicate with `v9`. `v9` is around (-1.9, -2.0). `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). A configuration like `(0.0, -1.75)` for `v12` to communicate with `v9`. Distance `sqrt((-1.9-0.0)^2+(-2.0-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(3.61+0.0625) = sqrt(3.6725) ~ 1.9`. Within 4.
           `#o0_v14_v9`: for `v14` to communicate with `v9`. `v9` is around (-1.9, -2.0). `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). A configuration like `(-1.0, -1.75)` (which is `v15`) for `v14` to communicate with `v9`. Distance `sqrt((-1.9-(-1.0))^2+(-2.0-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.81+0.0625) = sqrt(0.8725) ~ 0.93`. Within 4.
           
           For `above`:
           `#o5_v14_v3`: for `v14` to sample `v3`. `v3` is at ((-1.885, -1.296), (-1.78, -1.19)). `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). A configuration like `(-1.8, -1.25)` is right above it.
           `#o5_v14_v1`: for `v14` to sample `v1`. `v1` is at ((-1.259, 0.756), (-1.164, 0.851)). A configuration like `(-1.2, 0.8)` is right above it.
           `#o5_v14_v4`: for `v14` to sample `v4`. `v4` is at ((1.588, -0.425), (1.685, -0.328)). This is far from `v14` initial position, rover `v12` (at `v13` (1.0, -1.75)) is closer. Let's use `v12` for `v4` and `v7`.
           `#o5_v12_v4`: for `v12` to sample `v4`. A configuration like `(1.6, -0.3)` is right above it.
           `#o5_v12_v7`: for `v12` to sample `v7`. `v7` is at ((1.954, -0.904), (2.079, -0.779)). A configuration like `(2.0, -0.8)` is right above it.
           `#o5_v14_v5`: for `v14` to sample `v5`. `v5` is at ((0.879, 1.027), (1.02, 1.168)). This is closer to `v12`. Let's use `v12` for `v5`.
           `#o5_v12_v5`: for `v12` to sample `v5`. A configuration like `(0.9, 1.0)` is right above it.
           `#o5_v14_v8`: for `v14` to sample `v8`. `v8` is at ((0.626, -1.264), (0.749, -1.142)). This is closer to `v12`. Let's use `v12` for `v8`.
           `#o5_v12_v8`: for `v12` to sample `v8`. A configuration like `(0.7, -1.2)` is right above it.
           
           This split of sampling tasks seems more efficient and also makes the continuous value assignments more feasible.
           
           Rover `v12` will do:
           - Image `v17`
           - Sample `v4`, `v7`, `v5`, `v8`
           
           Rover `v14` will do:
           - Image `v19`, `v18`
           - Sample `v3`, `v1`
           
           All `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates use `#o0`, `#o1`, `#o3`, `#o4`, which are shared. `conf(v12, #o0)`, `conf(v14, #o0)`, `conf(v12, #o3)`, `conf(v14, #o3)`, `conf(v12, #o5)`, `conf(v14, #o5)` are given.
           This means we provide specific values for the shared configuration names for each rover-target pair.
           The problem statement: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration such that, given the geometry of the scene, the configuration is collision-free for the rover, reachable from the rover's current configuration, and has occlusion-free line-of-sight to the target object in the fourth argument in the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate." and "If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name."
           
           This means for a configuration like `#o0` which appears as `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`, we should provide two different configurations, one for `v12` communicating with `v9` and another for `v14` communicating with `v9`.
           
           So let's define the continuous values.
           For imaging:
           `#o3_v12_v17` for `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`
           `#o3_v14_v19` for `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)`
           `#o3_v14_v18` for `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           
           For communication:
           `#o0_v12_v9` for `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           `#o0_v14_v9` for `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           
           For sampling (above):
           `#o5_v12_v4` for `above(v12, #o5, v4)`
           `#o5_v12_v7` for `above(v12, #o5, v7)`
           `#o5_v12_v5` for `above(v12, #o5, v5)`
           `#o5_v12_v8` for `above(v12, #o5, v8)`
           `#o5_v14_v3` for `above(v14, #o5, v3)`
           `#o5_v14_v1` for `above(v14, #o5, v1)`
           
           The rays `#o1` and `#o4` are also continuous parameters, but the problem states "The third argument to the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate is the ray from the configuration to the target object." This implies these are derived from the configuration and target and we don't need to specify them explicitly, just that they exist.
           
           Let's make sure the plan is collision-free and executable.
           The configuration values selected must be "collision-free for the rover, reachable from the rover's current configuration, and has occlusion-free line-of-sight to the target object".
           The initial state for motion is `motion(v12, v13, #o2, v13)` and `motion(v14, v15, #o2, v15)`. These imply that the rovers can move from their current configuration to the exact same configuration via some path `#o2`. This is typically used to indicate that if the robot has to move to perform an action, a path can be found. Since the `atconf` predicates for sampling and imaging will change the `atconf` state, we'll need to move back to the communication configuration. However, the available `move` actions only allow moving from the current config to the same config. This means that we assume the robot can move to the required observation/sampling configuration and then return to its current communication/observation configuration implicitly, if there isn't an explicit `move` action. Or, that the observation and communication actions can happen from the same config. The current `move` actions are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`. This means we can only move the rovers from their current config and back to the same config, which effectively means no true movement to a different spot is allowed.
           If `atconf(?v, ?q)` is a precondition, and `?q` is a #config, then the rover `?v` must be able to get to `?q`.
           Since there are no `move` actions to configurations other than `v13` and `v15` for the respective rovers, this implies that all `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis` actions must happen from the rovers' current configurations, `v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14`.
           This significantly simplifies the problem. It means the continuous configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` for `v12` must be `v13`, and for `v14` must be `v15`. Let's re-evaluate based on this.
           
           If the configurations must be `v13` and `v15`:
           Rover `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           - `imagevisible(v12, v13, #o4_v12_v17, v17)` for `v17` ((0.374, 1.814), (0.472, 1.913)). Distance `sqrt((0.42-1.0)^2+(1.86-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.3364+13.0321) = sqrt(13.3685) ~ 3.65`. This is greater than 2, so `v12` cannot image `v17` from `v13`.
           This means `receivedimage(v17, v11)` is not achievable if `v12` must stay at `v13`.
           Let's check `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           - `imagevisible(v14, v15, #o4_v14_v19, v19)` for `v19` ((-1.886, 1.883), (-1.787, 1.981)). Distance `sqrt((-1.83-(-1.0))^2+(1.93-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.6889+13.5424) = sqrt(14.2313) ~ 3.77`. This is greater than 2.
           - `imagevisible(v14, v15, #o4_v14_v18, v18)` for `v18` ((-0.459, 1.875), (-0.366, 1.968)). Distance `sqrt((-0.41-(-1.0))^2+(1.92-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.3481+13.4689) = sqrt(13.817) ~ 3.71`. This is greater than 2.
           
           This interpretation of the `move` actions makes the `receivedimage` goals unachievable.
           
           However, the problem statement "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration" strongly implies that the rover *can* be moved to that configuration. The initial `motion` predicates with `#o2` also suggest there's a way for motion. The lack of `move` actions to *different* configurations is problematic.
           
           Let's assume the continuous values provided for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` *are* reachable and collision-free configurations, and the `motion` predicates are abstract. The problem description states: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." This means that only the provided `move` actions are available. If no `move` action can take the robot to `#o3`, `#o0`, or `#o5`, then those configurations cannot be reached.
           The available `move` actions are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`. These imply that the configuration of the rover remains `v13` or `v15` after the move action. This would mean that any action that requires a different configuration (like `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`) as its `atconf` precondition cannot be satisfied unless those `#o` configurations are effectively identical to `v13` or `v15` respectively. But we already established that they would be too far.
           
           This is a critical point. If the `move` actions are strictly interpreted as only allowing movement from a configuration back to itself, then the plan is impossible as all image and analysis collection requires being at the `#o` configurations.
           However, the problem description for `#` values says "reachable from the rover's current configuration". This phrasing implies that the rover *can* move to these new configurations. The conflict is between the specific list of allowed actions and the general problem description for continuous parameters.
           
           I will proceed under the assumption that the `conf(rover, #name)` in the initial state and the requirement to provide continuous values for them means that the robot can magically go to these configurations when needed for `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` preconditions, without an explicit `move` action, as long as they are "reachable from the rover's current configuration". The `atconf` predicate would then be set to the continuous parameter's value during the action. This is the only way to construct a plan, given the contradiction. The `atconf` precondition `atconf(?v, ?q)` must be satisfied, and if `?q` is `#o3`, then `atconf(v, #o3)` must be true. But the initial `atconf` facts only list `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`.
           
           This implies that the `atconf` state should dynamically change to the required `#q` values for the duration of the action. This is unusual. Standard PDDL requires `atconf` to be explicit.
           Let's re-read the `move` action.
           `move(?v: object, ?q1: object, ?t: object, ?q2: object)`
           Precondition: `atconf(?v, ?q1)`
           Effects: `atconf(?v, ?q2)` and `NegatedAtom atconf(?v, ?q1)`
           
           If the allowed moves are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`, these actions effectively change `atconf(v12, v13)` to `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` to `atconf(v14, v15)`. They are no-ops with respect to `atconf`, and they have no impact on reaching other configurations.
           
           Given this strict interpretation of allowed actions, the goals requiring `atconf(rover, #oX)` where `#oX` is not `v13` or `v15` are not achievable.
           
           However, the problem setup is a planning problem and implies a solution exists. The phrasing for the continuous parameters is key: "If your plan uses some object #<name> ... such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration". This indicates that `conf(rover, #<name>)` being in the initial state means that such a configuration is *available* to the rover, and can be used for actions. The `atconf` precondition must still hold for the action, however.
           
           This is a difficult ambiguity. I will assume that the problem expects me to use the provided continuous parameters, and that an implicit `move` to that configuration is allowed for the actions `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`. This means the `atconf(?v, ?q)` precondition for these actions implies that `?q` can be `#o0`, `#o3`, or `#o5`, and the rover is "at" that configuration for the duration of the action, effectively overriding `atconf(v12, v13)` or `atconf(v14, v15)`.
           If this is not the case, the problem is unsolvable with the given `move` actions.
           
           Let's assume the rover stays at `v13` or `v15` for *all* actions, and `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` refer to the specific poses *within* `v13` or `v15` that allow these functionalities, but the actual rover global configuration remains `v13` or `v15`.
           If `conf(v12, #o0)` exists, and `atconf(v12, v13)` is true, for an action to require `atconf(v12, #o0)`, then `#o0` must be `v13`. We have already calculated that `v13` is too far for many `imagevisible` predicates.
           
           The only way to proceed is to assume that the `conf(rover, #name)` predicates in the initial state allow the rover to 'virtually' be at these configurations for the specific actions, even if its `atconf` fact explicitly remains `v13` or `v15`. This is a stretch given PDDL syntax, but it's the only way to find a plan with the given available actions. I will define the configurations as if the robot moves there.
           
           This implies that the `atconf` predicates for `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis` are implicitly satisfied by providing a value for the `#` parameter, and the "atconf" state of the rover doesn't need to change explicitly via `move` actions for these.
           This contradicts the strict PDDL interpretation, but is the only way to solve this given the limited `move` actions.
           
           Plan outline, assuming rovers can "be at" `#` configurations when specified:
           
           **Rover `v12` (at `v13`) tasks:**
           - Image `v17`
           - Sample `v4`, `v7`, `v5`, `v8`
           - Send analysis and image data for its tasks.
           
           **Rover `v14` (at `v15`) tasks:**
           - Image `v19`, `v18`
           - Sample `v3`, `v1`
           - Send analysis and image data for its tasks.
           
           Let's sequence the actions.
           
           **Rover v12 actions:**
           1. Calibrate for v17: `calibrate(v12, #o3_v12_v17, #o4, v17, v10)`
           2. Take image of v17: `take_image(v12, #o3_v12_v17, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`
           3. Send image of v17: `send_image(v12, #o0_v12_v9, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`
              (Now `receivedimage(v17, v11)` is true)
           
           4. Sample v4: `sample_rock(v12, #o5_v12_v4, v4, v16)` (store full)
           5. Send analysis of v4: `send_analysis(v12, #o0_v12_v9, #o1, v9, v4)`
           6. Drop rock v4: `drop_rock(v12, v16)` (store free)
           
           7. Sample v7: `sample_rock(v12, #o5_v12_v7, v7, v16)` (store full)
           8. Send analysis of v7: `send_analysis(v12, #o0_v12_v9, #o1, v9, v7)`
           9. Drop rock v7: `drop_rock(v12, v16)` (store free)
           
           10. Sample v5: `sample_rock(v12, #o5_v12_v5, v5, v16)` (store full)
           11. Send analysis of v5: `send_analysis(v12, #o0_v12_v9, #o1, v9, v5)`
           12. Drop rock v5: `drop_rock(v12, v16)` (store free)
           
           13. Sample v8: `sample_rock(v12, #o5_v12_v8, v8, v16)` (store full)
           14. Send analysis of v8: `send_analysis(v12, #o0_v12_v9, #o1, v9, v8)`
           15. Drop rock v8: `drop_rock(v12, v16)` (store free)
           
           **Rover v14 actions:**
           1. Calibrate for v19: `calibrate(v14, #o3_v14_v19, #o4, v19, v10)`
           2. Take image of v19: `take_image(v14, #o3_v14_v19, #o4, v19, v10, v11)`
           3. Send image of v19: `send_image(v14, #o0_v14_v9, #o1, v9, v19, v11)`
              (Now `receivedimage(v19, v11)` is true)
           
           4. Calibrate for v18: `calibrate(v14, #o3_v14_v18, #o4, v18, v10)`
           5. Take image of v18: `take_image(v14, #o3_v14_v18, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`
           6. Send image of v18: `send_image(v14, #o0_v14_v9, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`
              (Now `receivedimage(v18, v11)` is true)
           
           7. Sample v3: `sample_rock(v14, #o5_v14_v3, v3, v16)` (store full)
           8. Send analysis of v3: `send_analysis(v14, #o0_v14_v9, #o1, v9, v3)`
           9. Drop rock v3: `drop_rock(v14, v16)` (store free)
           
           10. Sample v1: `sample_rock(v14, #o5_v14_v1, v1, v16)` (store full)
           11. Send analysis of v1: `send_analysis(v14, #o0_v14_v9, #o1, v9, v1)`
           12. Drop rock v1: `drop_rock(v14, v16)` (store free)
           
           This comprehensive plan covers all `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` goals, and respects the store capacity constraint by dropping rocks.
           The order of `v12` and `v14` actions does not matter as they operate on different rovers and objects.

           Configurations for the plan:
           `#o3_v12_v17` for `v12` to image `v17`. `v17` is around (0.42, 1.86). `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). Let `(0.7, 1.0)`
             Distance to `v17`: `sqrt((0.42-0.7)^2 + (1.86-1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.0784 + 0.7396) = sqrt(0.818) ~ 0.90`. (OK, < 2)
           `#o3_v14_v19` for `v14` to image `v19`. `v19` is around (-1.83, 1.93). `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). Let `(-1.5, 1.0)`
             Distance to `v19`: `sqrt((-1.83-(-1.5))^2 + (1.93-1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.1089 + 0.8649) = sqrt(0.9738) ~ 0.98`. (OK, < 2)
           `#o3_v14_v18` for `v14` to image `v18`. `v18` is around (-0.41, 1.92). `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). Let `(-0.7, 1.0)`
             Distance to `v18`: `sqrt((-0.41-(-0.7))^2 + (1.92-1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.0841 + 0.8464) = sqrt(0.9305) ~ 0.96`. (OK, < 2)
           
           `#o0_v12_v9` for `v12` to communicate with `v9`. `v9` is around (-1.9, -2.0). `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). Let `(0.0, -1.75)`
             Distance to `v9`: `sqrt((-1.9-0.0)^2 + (-2.0-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(3.61 + 0.0625) = sqrt(3.6725) ~ 1.92`. (OK, < 4)
           `#o0_v14_v9` for `v14` to communicate with `v9`. `v9` is around (-1.9, -2.0). `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). Let `(-1.0, -1.75)` (same as `v15`)
             Distance to `v9`: `sqrt((-1.9-(-1.0))^2 + (-2.0-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 0.0625) = sqrt(0.8725) ~ 0.93`. (OK, < 4)
           
           `#o5_v12_v4` for `v12` to sample `v4`. `v4` is around (1.63, -0.37). Let `(1.63, -0.37)`
             Distance to `v13`: `sqrt((1.63-1.0)^2+(-0.37-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.3969+1.8906) = sqrt(2.2875) ~ 1.51`. (OK, reachable, no specific limit for sample distance given, implicitly close)
           `#o5_v12_v7` for `v12` to sample `v7`. `v7` is around (2.01, -0.84). Let `(2.01, -0.84)`
             Distance to `v13`: `sqrt((2.01-1.0)^2+(-0.84-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(1.0201+0.8281) = sqrt(1.8482) ~ 1.36`.
           `#o5_v12_v5` for `v12` to sample `v5`. `v5` is around (0.95, 1.09). Let `(0.95, 1.09)`
             Distance to `v13`: `sqrt((0.95-1.0)^2+(1.09-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.0025+7.9524) = sqrt(7.9549) ~ 2.82`. This distance could be too large for `above`. Let's assume the continuous values for `#o5` are "above" the rock. Typically `above` implies close proximity. If this is an issue, then the goal is not reachable. However, no explicit distance limit is given for `above`.
           `#o5_v12_v8` for `v12` to sample `v8`. `v8` is around (0.68, -1.2). Let `(0.68, -1.2)`
             Distance to `v13`: `sqrt((0.68-1.0)^2+(-1.2-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.1024+0.3025) = sqrt(0.4049) ~ 0.63`.
           
           `#o5_v14_v3` for `v14` to sample `v3`. `v3` is around (-1.83, -1.24). Let `(-1.83, -1.24)`
             Distance to `v15`: `sqrt((-1.83-(-1.0))^2+(-1.24-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.6889+0.2601) = sqrt(0.949) ~ 0.97`.
           `#o5_v14_v1` for `v14` to sample `v1`. `v1` is around (-1.21, 0.8). Let `(-1.21, 0.8)`
             Distance to `v15`: `sqrt((-1.21-(-1.0))^2+(0.8-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.0441+6.5025) = sqrt(6.5466) ~ 2.55`. Again, this might be too large for `above`.
           
           The constraint "The maximum distance from the rover to the target is 2 for `imagevisible` and 4 for `comvisible`" is explicitly mentioned for these predicates, but not for `above`. Assuming `above` simply means spatially co-located vertically for sampling, the distances from the current `atconf` to the sampling pose are just travel distances, and we're operating under the assumption that these moves are implicitly handled without explicit `move` actions.
           
           Given the constraints and the provided actions, the interpretation of being able to dynamically use the continuous configs for actions without explicit `move` steps is the only way a plan can be formed.

I assumed that the existence of predicates like `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` in the initial state, coupled with the requirement to provide continuous values for `#o3`, implied that actions requiring these configurations could be performed, effectively overriding the absence of explicit `move` actions to these configurations.
           
           However, the feedback states unequivocally that *only* the provided list of actions is allowed. This list is:
           - `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`
           - `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`
           - `(drop_rock v12 v16)`
           - `(drop_rock v14 v16)`
           
           Let's re-examine the goal and the initial state with this strict constraint.
           
           The goal is `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which requires:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` (True initially)
           - `atconf(v14, v15)` (True initially)
           - `free(v12, v16)` (True initially)
           - `free(v14, v16)` (True initially)
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           - `receivedanalysis(v3)`
           - `receivedanalysis(v1)`
           - `receivedanalysis(v4)`
           - `receivedanalysis(v5)`
           - `receivedanalysis(v7)`
           - `receivedanalysis(v8)`
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(?o, ?m)`, we need `send_image`.
           `send_image(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l, ?o, ?m)` preconditions:
           - `comvisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l)`
           - `objective(?o)`
           - `mode(?m)`
           - `haveimage(?v, ?o, ?m)`
           - `atconf(?v, ?q)`
           - `~blocked(?y)`
           
           To achieve `haveimage(?v, ?o, ?m)`, we need `take_image`.
           `take_image(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o, ?c, ?m)` preconditions:
           - `imagevisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o)`
           - `onboard(?c, ?v)`
           - `supports(?c, ?m)`
           - `atconf(?v, ?q)`
           - `calibrated(?c, ?v)`
           - `~blocked(?y)`
           
           To achieve `calibrated(?c, ?v)`, we need `calibrate`.
           `calibrate(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o, ?c)` preconditions:
           - `imagevisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o)`
           - `onboard(?c, ?v)`
           - `atconf(?v, ?q)`
           - `~blocked(?y)`
           
           All these actions (`calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`) require `atconf(?v, ?q)` where `?q` is some configuration. Given the allowed `move` actions, the only configurations a rover can ever be "at" are `v13` (for `v12`) and `v15` (for `v14`). This means for any action, `?q` must be `v13` if `?v` is `v12`, or `v15` if `?v` is `v14`.
           
           Let's check if the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates can be satisfied with `v13` and `v15` as the configurations.
           Initial state has:
           - `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `conf(v12, #o3)`
           - `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)` and `conf(v14, #o3)`
           - `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` and `conf(v14, #o3)`
           - `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `conf(v12, #o0)`
           - `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `conf(v14, #o0)`
           
           As calculated previously, if `#o3` must be `v13` or `v15`, the distances for `imagevisible` predicates exceed the maximum range of 2.
           - `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `v17` (0.42, 1.86): Distance ~3.65 > 2.
           - `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `v19` (-1.83, 1.93): Distance ~3.77 > 2.
           - `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `v18` (-0.41, 1.92): Distance ~3.71 > 2.
           
           This means that no `take_image` action can be performed, as the `imagevisible` precondition can never be met with the rover at `v13` or `v15` for the specified objectives. Consequently, `haveimage` can never be achieved, and thus `send_image` can never be performed. This makes the `receivedimage` goals unachievable.
           
           Similarly, for `receivedanalysis(?r)`, we need `send_analysis`.
           `send_analysis(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l, ?r)` preconditions:
           - `comvisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l)`
           - `rock(?r)`
           - `analyzed(?v, ?r)`
           - `atconf(?v, ?q)`
           - `~blocked(?y)`
           
           To achieve `analyzed(?v, ?r)`, we need `sample_rock`.
           `sample_rock(?v, ?q, ?r, ?s)` preconditions:
           - `above(?v, ?q, ?r)`
           - `store(?s)`
           - `atconf(?v, ?q)`
           - `free(?v, ?s)`
           
           Again, `?q` must be `v13` or `v15`.
           Let's check `above` predicates.
           Initial state has:
           - `above(v12, #o5, v8)` and `conf(v12, #o5)`
           - `above(v12, #o5, v3)` and `conf(v12, #o5)`
           - `above(v12, #o5, v5)` and `conf(v12, #o5)`
           - `above(v12, #o5, v4)` and `conf(v12, #o5)`
           - `above(v12, #o5, v7)` and `conf(v12, #o5)`
           - `above(v12, #o5, v1)` and `conf(v12, #o5)`
           - `above(v14, #o5, v8)` and `conf(v14, #o5)` (same as for v12)
           - `above(v14, #o5, v3)` and `conf(v14, #o5)` (same as for v12)
           - `above(v14, #o5, v5)` and `conf(v14, #o5)` (same as for v12)
           - `above(v14, #o5, v4)` and `conf(v14, #o5)` (same as for v12)
           - `above(v14, #o5, v7)` and `conf(v14, #o5)` (same as for v12)
           - `above(v14, #o5, v1)` and `conf(v14, #o5)` (same as for v12)
           
           Let's assume `above` also has an implicit range constraint (e.g., must be directly over it). We previously calculated distances from `v13` or `v15` to the `above` positions for `v5` and `v1` which were around 2.5-2.8. Without an explicit distance, this is hard to judge. However, even if they are within some implicit range, these actions `sample_rock` are not in the list of allowed actions. The same applies to `send_analysis`.
           
           Therefore, with the strictly limited set of allowed actions, none of the `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` actions can be performed. This means that the goals `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` cannot be achieved. The only available actions are `move` (which does not change configuration) and `drop_rock` (which requires a `full` store, which is not true initially and cannot become true as `sample_rock` is not allowed).
           
           Given the strict list of allowed actions, the goal is not achievable from the initial state.
