           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, two stores `v16`, a camera `v10` that supports `v11` (mode), and several objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`) and rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`). A lander `v9` is present for communication. The rovers are initially at configurations `v13` and `v15` respectively. Both rovers have their stores `v16` free.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` is a conjunction of multiple conditions:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`
           3. `free(v12, v16)`
           4. `free(v14, v16)`
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           7. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           8. `type(?stone, v2)` (This implies analyzing a rock of type v2) and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`
           9. `type(?soil, v6)` (This implies analyzing a rock of type v6) and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           Let's break down how to achieve each part of the goal:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`:
               To achieve `receivedimage`, we need to first `take_image` and then `send_image`.
               - `take_image` requires `imagevisible`, `onboard`, `supports`, `atconf`, `calibrated`, and `~blocked`.
               - `send_image` requires `comvisible`, `objective`, `mode`, `haveimage`, `atconf`, and `~blocked`.
               - `calibrate` can be used to achieve `calibrated`.
               Rover `v12` or `v14` can be used. Both have `v10` onboard which supports `v11`. There are `imagevisible` predicates for `v17`, `v18`, `v19` with configurations `#o3` and ray `#o4`. There are `comvisible` predicates for `v9` with configurations `#o0` and ray `#o1`.
               Since `v12` is at `v13` and `v14` is at `v15`, we need to move to `#o3` for `take_image` and then to `#o0` for `send_image`, or `v13` / `v15` can be used to move to these configurations.
           
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`:
               To achieve `receivedanalysis`, we need to first `sample_rock` and then `send_analysis`.
               - `sample_rock` requires `above`, `store`, `atconf`, and `free`. It also sets `analyzed`.
               - `send_analysis` requires `comvisible`, `rock`, `analyzed`, `atconf`, and `~blocked`.
               We need to sample a rock of type `v2` (stone) and `v6` (soil).
               Rocks with type `v2` are `v1`, `v3`, `v4`. Rocks with type `v6` are `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
               The `above` predicates use configuration `#o5`. So, we need to move to `#o5` for sampling, then to `#o0` for sending the analysis.
           
           Let's consider an efficient plan:
           1. Rover `v12` needs to take images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19` and send them.
           2. Rover `v14` needs to sample rocks of type `v2` and `v6` and send their analysis.
           
           Let's pick specific rocks:
           - Type `v2`: `v3` (AABB ((-1.885, -1.296), (-1.78, -1.19))), `v1` (AABB ((-1.259, 0.756), (-1.164, 0.851))), `v4` (AABB ((1.588, -0.425), (1.685, -0.328))).
           - Type `v6`: `v5` (AABB ((0.879, 1.027), (1.02, 1.168))), `v7` (AABB ((1.954, -0.904), (2.079, -0.779))), `v8` (AABB ((0.626, -1.264), (0.749, -1.142))).
           
           Rover `v14` is at `v15` (x=-1.0, y=-1.75).
           Rover `v12` is at `v13` (x=1.0, y=-1.75).
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis` for `v2` and `v6`:
           - `v14` is closer to `v3` (type v2) and `v8` (type v6) for sampling at `#o5`. `v14` needs to go to `#o5` to sample.
           - `v14` can sample `v3` (type v2) and `v8` (type v6). It has `free(v14, v16)`. After sampling one, it will be `full(v14, v16)`. It will need to `drop_rock` to `free` the store to sample another.
           
           Plan for `v14` (analysis):
           1. `move v14 v15 #o2 #o5`
           2. `sample_rock v14 #o5 v3 v16` (analyzes a rock of type `v2`)
           3. `move v14 #o5 #o2 #o0` (move to configuration for communication)
           4. `send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v3`
           5. `drop_rock v14 v16`
           6. `move v14 #o0 #o2 #o5`
           7. `sample_rock v14 #o5 v8 v16` (analyzes a rock of type `v6`)
           8. `move v14 #o5 #o2 #o0`
           9. `send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v8`
           10. `drop_rock v14 v16` (to fulfill `free(v14, v16)` in the goal, though not strictly required by the axiom for final goal state)
           11. `move v14 #o0 #o2 v15` (back to initial config for goal `atconf(v14, v15)`)
           
           Plan for `v12` (images):
           - `v12` is at `v13` (x=1.0, y=-1.75).
           - It needs to be at `#o3` for `take_image` and `#o0` for `send_image`.
           - We need to `calibrate` the camera `v10` first.
           
           1. `move v12 v13 #o2 #o3`
           2. `calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10`
           3. `take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11`
           4. `calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10` (camera is uncalibrated after taking an image)
           5. `take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11`
           6. `calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v19 v10`
           7. `take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v19 v10 v11`
           8. `move v12 #o3 #o2 #o0`
           9. `send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11`
           10. `send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11`
           11. `send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v19 v11`
           12. `move v12 #o0 #o2 v13` (back to initial config for goal `atconf(v12, v13)`)
           
           We can interleave these or do them in sequence. Let's do the sampling and analysis first, then the imaging.
           For the goal axiom, we need to ensure `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)` are true *at the end*. So the drop_rock actions are important, and moving back to the initial configurations.
           
           The continuous parameters `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` need to be assigned values.
           - `#o5` for `above` rocks. Let's pick a configuration central to the rocks `v3`, `v8`.
             `v3`: ((-1.885, -1.296), (-1.78, -1.19))
             `v8`: ((0.626, -1.264), (0.749, -1.142))
             Given rover `v14` starts at (-1.0, -1.75), a config around (-0.5, -1.2) could work for both.
           - `#o3` for `imagevisible` to `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
             `v17`: ((0.374, 1.814), (0.472, 1.913))
             `v18`: ((-0.459, 1.875), (-0.366, 1.968))
             `v19`: ((-1.886, 1.883), (-1.787, 1.981))
             Rover `v12` starts at (1.0, -1.75). A configuration around (0.0, 1.0) seems reasonable to see all three. Max distance is 2.
           - `#o0` for `comvisible` to `v9` (lander: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))).
             Rover `v12` is at (1.0, -1.75) and `v14` is at (-1.0, -1.75). The lander is far from both.
             `v9` (lander) is around (-1.9, -2.0).
             `v14` at (-1.0, -1.75) is closer to `v9`. A configuration around (-1.5, -1.8) for `v14` would be good for communication.
             For `v12` at (1.0, -1.75), a configuration around (0.0, -1.8) might be reasonable if it can see the lander. Max distance is 4.
           
           Let's refine the configuration choices:
           - For `v14` to sample `v3` and `v8`:
               `v3` is at (minx: -1.885, miny: -1.296, maxx: -1.78, maxy: -1.19)
               `v8` is at (minx: 0.626, miny: -1.264, maxx: 0.749, maxy: -1.142)
               `v14` is at (-1.0, -1.75).
               A configuration `#o5` for `v14` at (0.0, -1.2) seems like a good compromise to be "above" both rocks.
           - For `v12` to image `v17`, `v18`, `v19`:
               `v17` is at (minx: 0.374, miny: 1.814, maxx: 0.472, maxy: 1.913)
               `v18` is at (minx: -0.459, miny: 1.875, maxx: -0.366, maxy: 1.968)
               `v19` is at (minx: -1.886, miny: 1.883, maxx: -1.787, maxy: 1.981)
               `v12` is at (1.0, -1.75).
               A configuration `#o3` for `v12` at (-0.5, 0.0) seems good. The target objects are around y=1.9. So, maybe (0.0, 1.0) for good view, max dist 2. Let's try (-0.5, 0.0) which is closer to the initial position of v12.
           - For `v14` to communicate with `v9`:
               `v9` is at (minx: -2.405, miny: -2.346, maxx: -1.395, maxy: -1.654)
               `v14` at (-1.0, -1.75).
               A configuration `#o0` for `v14` at (-1.5, -2.0) is near the lander and within 4 distance.
           - For `v12` to communicate with `v9`:
               `v9` is at (minx: -2.405, miny: -2.346, maxx: -1.395, maxy: -1.654)
               `v12` at (1.0, -1.75).
               A configuration `#o0` for `v12` at (0.0, -2.0) is not bad for communicating with `v9`.
           
           Given that the goal involves a single axiom and there are multiple rovers and objects, we should choose one rover for analysis and one for imaging to optimize. However, the available action instances provided only list continuous parameters, so we cannot select which rover for which specific continuous configuration instance (#o0, #o3, #o5). The problem statement says: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration..."
           
           The initial state contains:
           `conf(v12, #o5)` and `above(v12, #o5, v8)` etc.
           `conf(v14, #o5)` and `above(v14, #o5, v8)` etc.
           So both `v12` and `v14` can use `#o5` for `above`.
           
           `conf(v12, #o0)` and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           `conf(v14, #o0)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           So both `v12` and `v14` can use `#o0` for `comvisible`.
           
           `conf(v12, #o3)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`
           `conf(v14, #o3)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`
           So both `v12` and `v14` can use `#o3` for `imagevisible`.
           
           I will assign `v14` to handle rock analysis (types v2 and v6) and `v12` to handle image collection and transmission for objectives `v17, v18, v19`. This way, they can operate somewhat in parallel.
           
           For `v14` (rock analysis):
           - Start at `v15`.
           - Move to `#o5` to be above rocks.
           - Sample `v3` (type v2). `v3` is at (-1.8, -1.2). `v14` starts at (-1.0, -1.75). A configuration like (-1.5, -1.2) for `#o5` for `v14` would be suitable.
           - Move to `#o0` for communication.
           - Send analysis of `v3`.
           - Drop `v3`.
           - Move back to `#o5`.
           - Sample `v8` (type v6). `v8` is at (0.6, -1.2).
           - Move to `#o0`.
           - Send analysis of `v8`.
           - Drop `v8`.
           - Move back to `v15`.
           
           For `v12` (imaging):
           - Start at `v13`.
           - Move to `#o3` for imaging `v17`, `v18`, `v19`. `v17` is at (0.4, 1.8), `v18` at (-0.4, 1.8), `v19` at (-1.8, 1.8). `v12` starts at (1.0, -1.75). A configuration like (0.0, 0.5) for `#o3` for `v12` would allow visibility to all three.
           - Calibrate and take images for `v17, v18, v19`.
           - Move to `#o0` for communication.
           - Send images.
           - Move back to `v13`.
           
           Let's specify the configurations:
           - For `v14`'s `#o5` (above `v3` and `v8`): given `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). `v3` is at (-1.8, -1.2) and `v8` is at (0.6, -1.2). I will pick `#o5` for `v14` at `(-0.5, -1.2)`. This is roughly equidistant and close to both.
           - For `v14`'s `#o0` (comvisible `v9`): `v9` is at (-1.9, -2.0). I will pick `#o0` for `v14` at `(-1.5, -2.0)`.
           - For `v12`'s `#o3` (imagevisible `v17, v18, v19`): given `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). `v17` is at (0.4, 1.8), `v18` at (-0.4, 1.8), `v19` at (-1.8, 1.8). I will pick `#o3` for `v12` at `(0.0, 1.0)`. This is a central point for observing all three objectives.
           - For `v12`'s `#o0` (comvisible `v9`): `v9` is at (-1.9, -2.0). `v12` at (1.0, -1.75). I will pick `#o0` for `v12` at `(0.0, -2.0)`.
           
           A possible plan:
           
           Rover V14: (Rock analysis)
           1. Move to a position above the rocks (`#o5`).
           2. Sample rock `v3` (type v2).
           3. Move to a communication position (`#o0`).
           4. Send analysis of `v3`.
           5. Drop `v3` to free up storage.
           6. Move back to a position above the rocks (`#o5`).
           7. Sample rock `v8` (type v6).
           8. Move to a communication position (`#o0`).
           9. Send analysis of `v8`.
           10. Drop `v8` to free up storage.
           11. Return to its initial configuration `v15`.
           
           Rover V12: (Image acquisition and transmission)
           1. Move to a position from which objectives are visible (`#o3`).
           2. Calibrate camera for `v17`.
           3. Take image of `v17`.
           4. Calibrate camera for `v18`.
           5. Take image of `v18`.
           6. Calibrate camera for `v19`.
           7. Take image of `v19`.
           8. Move to a communication position (`#o0`).
           9. Send image of `v17`.
           10. Send image of `v18`.
           11. Send image of `v19`.
           12. Return to its initial configuration `v13`.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The previous plan failed due to collisions and occlusions with the chosen continuous configurations. Let's re-evaluate the configurations, keeping in mind the obstacles. A new obstacle `v20` with AABB `((-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), (0.05, 2.5, 0.1))` has been introduced, which is a thin wall along the y-axis at x=0. This significantly impacts configurations around x=0.
           
           Let's adjust the configurations to avoid `v20` (the wall at x=0):
           
           Rover `v14` (rock analysis):
           - Initial position: `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           - Rocks to sample: `v3` (type v2, at (-1.8, -1.2)) and `v8` (type v6, at (0.6, -1.2)).
           - Lander `v9` for communication: (-1.9, -2.0).
           
           Revised configurations for `v14`:
           - `#o5` for `above` `v3` and `v8`:
               `v3` is on the left of `v20`. `v8` is on the right of `v20`.
               If `v14` stays on the left of `v20`, it can easily reach `v3`. For `v8`, it would need to cross `v20`.
               Let's use `v14` to sample `v3` and `v1` (both type v2) which are on the left side of the wall, or, for v6, maybe `v5` (0.879, 1.027) which is also on the right.
               Given `v14` is at (-1.0, -1.75), let's keep it on the left of the wall for analysis if possible.
               `v3` (type v2) is at (-1.8, -1.2).
               `v1` (type v2) is at (-1.259, 0.756).
               `v8` (type v6) is at (0.626, -1.264).
               `v5` (type v6) is at (0.879, 1.027).
           
               The problem asks for one rock of type v2 and one of type v6.
               Let `v14` sample `v3` (type v2) and `v8` (type v6). This means `v14` would need to cross the `v20` wall.
               Alternatively, for `v14` to sample `v3` (type v2) and `v5` (type v6): `v3` is on the left, `v5` is on the right.
               Let's assign `v14` to sample `v3` (type v2) and `v8` (type v6) as originally planned, but now consider the `v20` wall.
               To be `above` `v3` (near -1.8, -1.2) from `v14` at (-1.0, -1.75), `#o5_v14_v3` could be `(-1.5, -1.2)`. This is left of `v20`.
               To be `above` `v8` (near 0.6, -1.2), `v14` needs to cross `v20`. `#o5_v14_v8` could be `(0.5, -1.2)`.
               Since `#o5` is a single configuration for `v14`, this means `v14` has to move between two `#o5` locations. This might mean `move v14 #o5_v3 #o2 #o5_v8`.
               However, the `above` predicates use `#o5` as a generic configuration. It usually means the rover needs to be in *some* configuration that is above the rock.
               If `#o5` for `v14` is specified, it should be a single continuous value for all uses. This implies `#o5` should be a configuration from which `v14` can get above *all* rocks needed. This is not possible if rocks are on opposite sides of `v20`.
               Let's check the available actions again. `above(?v: object, ?q: object, ?r: object)`. `#o5` is a specific continuous parameter.
               If `v14` can only move to one `#o5` for `above` for all rocks, and rocks are on different sides of `v20`, then it's problematic.
               The problem states: "If your plan uses some object #<name> ... then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair".
               So, `#o5` for `v3` and `#o5` for `v8` are two distinct continuous values. This simplifies things.
           
           Let's rename the continuous parameters for clarity based on (rover, target object):
           - `conf_above_v14_v3` for `v14` above `v3`
           - `conf_above_v14_v8` for `v14` above `v8`
           - `conf_com_v14_v9` for `v14` communicating with `v9`
           - `conf_image_v12_v17` for `v12` imaging `v17`
           - `conf_image_v12_v18` for `v12` imaging `v18`
           - `conf_image_v12_v19` for `v12` imaging `v19`
           - `conf_com_v12_v9` for `v12` communicating with `v9`
           
           Mapping these back to the given `#o` objects:
           The initial state lists `conf(v14, #o5)` and `above(v14, #o5, v3)`, `above(v14, #o5, v8)`, `above(v14, #o5, v1)`, `above(v14, #o5, v4)`, `above(v14, #o5, v5)`, `above(v14, #o5, v7)`.
           This implies `#o5` is intended to be a single configuration for `v14` that allows it to be above *all* these rocks. This is impossible given `v20`.
           
           This means the current problem setup is internally contradictory with `v20` as an obstacle and `#o5` as a single configuration for all `above` predicates. However, the rule states "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value...". It does not say this for `above` predicates. This means I should use the given `#o5` as is for `above` predicates. If this configuration is not valid for the chosen rocks, then these `sample_rock` actions might not be possible. But the planner must make sense of the given initial state.
           
           Let's re-read the specific instruction about continuous values: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration...". This only explicitly requires me to provide values for #o0 (comvisible) and #o3 (imagevisible), if used. For `#o5` (above), I only need to make sure the rover is at that configuration, and that configuration needs to satisfy the `above` predicate. I *don't* define values for `#o5` if it's not explicitly in `imagevisible` or `comvisible` in the initial state. Since it's only in `above`, I don't provide it. The planner should assume that if `#o5` is used, it is a valid configuration for `above`.
           
           So, the previous issue of `#o5` being a single point for `above` all rocks across `v20` is handled by the problem description: I assume `#o5` is a valid configuration for `above`. I only provide values for `#o0` and `#o3`.
           
           Let's focus on `v20` (`x=0` wall) and re-calculate `#o0` and `#o3`.
           
           Rover `v14` (rock analysis):
           - `#o5`: For `sample_rock`, `v14` needs to be `atconf(v14, #o5)`. The previous plan used `#o5` for `v3` and `v8`. The problem says `above(v14, #o5, v3)` and `above(v14, #o5, v8)` are in the initial state, so `#o5` is a valid configuration for sampling these. I don't need to specify it.
           - `#o0` for `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`: `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). `v9` is at (-1.9, -2.0).
               The previous `#o0` was `(-1.5, -2.0)`, which collided with `v9` itself. This is a common error. `v9` is the lander, and the configuration should be collision-free with all obstacles, including `v9`.
               `v9` AABB: `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
               A good communication point for `v14` to `v9` would be near `v9` but not colliding. Perhaps to the right of `v9` on its `x` coordinate. Let's try `(-1.0, -2.0)` for `#o0` for `v14`. This should be clear of `v20` as well.
           
           Rover `v12` (image acquisition and transmission):
           - Initial position: `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           - Objectives `v17` (0.4, 1.8), `v18` (-0.4, 1.8), `v19` (-1.8, 1.8).
           - Lander `v9` for communication: (-1.9, -2.0).
           
           Revised configurations for `v12`:
           - `#o3` for `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `v18`, `v19`:
               All objectives `v17, v18, v19` are above y=1.8. `v12` is at (1.0, -1.75).
               The `v20` wall is at `x=0`. `v17` is at (0.4, 1.8) (right of wall). `v18` (-0.4, 1.8) (left of wall). `v19` (-1.8, 1.8) (left of wall).
               A single configuration `#o3` for `v12` to see all three is difficult given `v20`.
               This implies the same interpretation error: I should provide *different* continuous values for *each* (rover, target object) pair.
               So, `#o3` for `v17` is different from `#o3` for `v18` etc.
           
           Let's rename the continuous parameters to be specific for (rover, target object):
           - `conf_com_v14_v9`: `comvisible(v14, conf_com_v14_v9, #o1, v9)`
           - `conf_image_v12_v17`: `imagevisible(v12, conf_image_v12_v17, #o4, v17)`
           - `conf_image_v12_v18`: `imagevisible(v12, conf_image_v12_v18, #o4, v18)`
           - `conf_image_v12_v19`: `imagevisible(v12, conf_image_v12_v19, #o4, v19)`
           - `conf_com_v12_v9`: `comvisible(v12, conf_com_v12_v9, #o1, v9)`
           
           The initial state, however, only lists `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` as `conf(v, #o)` and in `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicates. This means I must use the `_same_` #o0, #o3. This is where the constraint is tight.
           "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration such that, given the geometry of the scene, the configuration is collision-free for the rover, reachable from the rover's current configuration, and has occlusion-free line-of-sight to the target object in the fourth argument in the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate. ... If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name."
           
           This means for `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)`, I must provide separate values for `#o3` for each target. The continuous parameter `#o3` represents distinct configurations for each target. This solves the `v20` wall problem for imaging multiple objects.
           
           Let's use `v14` for `v3` (type v2) and `v8` (type v6) sampling and analysis, and `v12` for all image collection and transmission.
           
           Revised Plan Strategy:
           Rover V14 (Rock analysis):
           - Start at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           - `#o5`: This parameter for `above` is assumed valid.
           - `conf_com_v14_v9` (using `#o0` from problem description): `v14` to `v9`. `v9` is at (-1.9, -2.0). `v20` is at x=0. `v14` is on the left of `v20`. Let's put `v14`'s comm config at `(-1.0, -2.0)`. This should be collision-free with `v9` and `v20`.
           
           Rover V12 (Image acquisition and transmission):
           - Start at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           - `v17` (0.4, 1.8), `v18` (-0.4, 1.8), `v19` (-1.8, 1.8). `v20` at x=0.
           - `conf_image_v12_v17` (using `#o3` from problem description): For `v17` (0.4, 1.8), from `v12` at (1.0, -1.75). A configuration like `(0.5, 0.5)` is on the right side of `v20`. Max dist 2 for image.
           - `conf_image_v12_v18` (using `#o3` from problem description): For `v18` (-0.4, 1.8). `v12` needs to cross `v20`. A configuration like `(-0.5, 0.5)` is on the left side of `v20`.
           - `conf_image_v12_v19` (using `#o3` from problem description): For `v19` (-1.8, 1.8). A configuration like `(-1.0, 0.5)` is also on the left of `v20`.
           - `conf_com_v12_v9` (using `#o0` from problem description): `v12` to `v9` (-1.9, -2.0). `v12` at (1.0, -1.75). This means `v12` has to cross `v20`. A configuration like `(-0.5, -2.0)` should be clear of `v20` and `v9`. Max dist 4 for com.
           
           The plan needs to reflect the movement of `v12` across `v20` if it needs to image `v18` and `v19` (left of wall) and `v17` (right of wall).
           
           Let's refine the plan sequence for `v12` to handle the wall `v20`:
           1. Move `v12` to `(0.5, 0.5)` (new `#o3` for `v17`).
           2. Calibrate and take image of `v17`.
           3. Move `v12` to `(-0.5, 0.5)` (new `#o3` for `v18`).
           4. Calibrate and take image of `v18`.
           5. Move `v12` to `(-1.0, 0.5)` (new `#o3` for `v19`).
           6. Calibrate and take image of `v19`.
           7. Move `v12` to `(-0.5, -2.0)` (new `#o0` for `v9`).
           8. Send images.
           9. Move back to `v13` (1.0, -1.75). This will require crossing `v20` again.
           
           Let's define configurations with original `#o` names for the plan:
           `#o5` is for `above` (no value to be specified by me).
           `#o0` will be split for `v14` to `v9` and `v12` to `v9`.
           `#o3` will be split for `v12` to `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           
           This is the tricky part. The input available actions only use `#o0` and `#o3` without suffixes for different targets:
           `((calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10))`
           `((take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11))`
           `((send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v3))`
           `((send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11))`
           
           This suggests that #o0 and #o3 are *single* continuous configurations that work for all their respective uses. This contradicts the "provide a different continuous value for each (rover, target object) pair" part. I should follow the action instances given to me. The provided actions use `#o0` and `#o3` *without* distinction per target. This implies that if a single #o0 or #o3 value is provided, it should work for *all* the target objects for that specific rover-configuration combination.
           
           If `#o3` must be one point for `v12` to see `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, then it's impossible given `v20`. `v17` is right of `v20`, `v18` and `v19` are left of `v20`. Any point `(x,y)` for `v12` would either be blocked by `v20` for `v17`, or blocked by `v20` for `v18`/`v19`.
           
           This implies the goal `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)` is NOT achievable as stated with the current actions and obstacles. The problem explicitly states that any action not in the given list is not allowed. The list doesn't provide `take_image` or `calibrate` with different configuration names for different targets that share the same `#o3` variable in `conf`.
           
           The available actions list:
           `((calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10))`
           `((calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10))`
           `((calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v19 v10))`
           ... and similarly for `take_image`.
           This literally means that `#o3` is the *same* configuration for imaging `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`. And the same for `#o0` for communication. This is the crucial contradiction.
           
           Given `v20: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1))`, which is a wall along `x=0`.
           - To see `v17` (x=0.4), `v12` must be `x > 0.05` or `x < -0.05` and have a clear line of sight.
           - To see `v18` (x=-0.4) and `v19` (x=-1.8), `v12` must be `x < -0.05` or `x > 0.05` and have a clear line of sight.
           If `#o3` is a single configuration, it cannot be on both sides of `v20` simultaneously. If `v12` is to the right of `v20`, it cannot see `v18` or `v19` due to `v20`. If `v12` is to the left of `v20`, it cannot see `v17`.
           Therefore, the goal `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)` cannot be achieved simultaneously with a single `#o3` configuration for `v12`.
           
           Let me re-read "If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name."
           This implies that `#o3` when used with `v17` for `v12` is a *different* instance than `#o3` when used with `v18` for `v12`. Even though they are both called `#o3` in the initial state predicates. This makes sense. The planner expects me to treat `#o3` as a *placeholder* for distinct continuous values depending on context.
           
           So, I need to provide values for:
           - `#o0` for `v14` to `v9`
           - `#o0` for `v12` to `v9`
           - `#o3` for `v12` to `v17`
           - `#o3` for `v12` to `v18`
           - `#o3` for `v12` to `v19`
           
           Let's assign specific placeholder names in the plan for clarity when moving the robot and then map them to the PDDL `#o` names for the final config list.
           Let `_q_image_v12_v17` be the config for `v12` imaging `v17`.
           Let `_q_image_v12_v18` be the config for `v12` imaging `v18`.
           Let `_q_image_v12_v19` be the config for `v12` imaging `v19`.
           Let `_q_com_v12_v9` be the config for `v12` communicating with `v9`.
           Let `_q_com_v14_v9` be the config for `v14` communicating with `v9`.
           
           For `sample_rock` actions, the second argument is `#o5`. I will assume `#o5` is a valid continuous value that the system will handle when `above` is called, and my plan will include `move` actions to `#o5`.
           
           Revised Configs (collision-free with `v20`):
           
           Rover `v14` (rock analysis):
           - Current at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           - To sample `v3` (-1.8, -1.2) and `v8` (0.6, -1.2):
               Since `#o5` is used for both, and given `v20` at `x=0`, it's impossible for a single `#o5` to be above both.
               This means the `above` predicate, where `#o5` is used, must refer to *different* instances of `#o5`. The problem statement is not as clear for `above` as it is for `imagevisible` and `comvisible`.
               "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value...". `#o5` is NOT in `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicates, it's in `above`. So I don't provide its value. The actions are given, for instance `(sample_rock v14 #o5 v3 v16)`. I must assume that the planner will find a valid #o5 for that action.
           
               So, for `v14` analysis:
               - Sample `v3` (type v2, at -1.8, -1.2).
               - Sample `v8` (type v6, at 0.6, -1.2).
               - `_q_com_v14_v9` (using `#o0`): `v14` to `v9` (-1.9, -2.0). `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). `v20` at `x=0`. `(-1.0, -2.0)` is a good value for `_q_com_v14_v9` as it is to the left of the wall and near lander `v9` (max dist 4).
           
           Rover `v12` (image acquisition and transmission):
           - Current at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           - `_q_image_v12_v17` (using `#o3`): `v17` (0.4, 1.8). From `v12` at (1.0, -1.75). Needs to be on right of `v20`. Try `(0.5, 0.5)`. This is clear of `v20` and `v17` is visible.
           - `_q_image_v12_v18` (using `#o3`): `v18` (-0.4, 1.8). `v12` needs to move to left of `v20`. Try `(-0.5, 0.5)`.
           - `_q_image_v12_v19` (using `#o3`): `v19` (-1.8, 1.8). `v12` needs to move to left of `v20`. Try `(-1.0, 0.5)`.
           - `_q_com_v12_v9` (using `#o0`): `v12` to `v9` (-1.9, -2.0). `v12` at (1.0, -1.75). Needs to move to left of `v20`. Try `(-0.5, -2.0)`.

           Rover V12:
           1. Move from `v13` to `_q_image_v12_v17`.
           2. `calibrate v12 _q_image_v12_v17 #o4 v17 v10`.

           4. Move from `_q_image_v12_v17` to `_q_image_v12_v18`.
           5. `calibrate v12 _q_image_v12_v18 #o4 v18 v10`.
           6. `take_image v12 _q_image_v12_v18 #o4 v18 v10 v11`.
           7. Move from `_q_image_v12_v18` to `_q_image_v12_v19`.
           8. `calibrate v12 _q_image_v12_v19 #o4 v19 v10`.
           9. `take_image v12 _q_image_v12_v19 #o4 v19 v10 v11`.
           10. Move from `_q_image_v12_v19` to `_q_com_v12_v9`.
           11. `send_image v12 _q_com_v12_v9 #o1 v9 v17 v11`.
           12. `send_image v12 _q_com_v12_v9 #o1 v9 v18 v11`.
           13. `send_image v12 _q_com_v12_v9 #o1 v9 v19 v11`.
           14. Move from `_q_com_v12_v9` to `v13`.
           
           The configurations in the plan must use the original `#o` names. So, in the plan, I use `#o0` or `#o3` and then specify their value for the specific (rover, target) in the configurations section.

User:      Configuration #o0 = (-1.0 -2.0) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (0.5 0.5) for rover v12 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (-0.5 0.5) for rover v12 at target v18 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (-1.0 0.5) for rover v12 at target v19 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-0.5 -2.0) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The robot base reachability issue indicates that the chosen configurations are too far from the initial positions or require impossible movements. Let's reconsider the reachability from initial positions `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) for `v14` and `v13` (1.0, -1.75) for `v12`.
           
           Maximum distance for a single move is not specified, but typically, configurations that are 'near' the robot's current location are reachable. The previous chosen configurations seem reasonable in terms of absolute coordinates but perhaps the path is blocked, or the definition of 'reachable' is stricter than just proximity. I will try to keep the new configurations as close as possible to the starting positions, or on a clear path.
           
           Let's also look at the objects again.
           `v14` (rover) at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           `v12` (rover) at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           `v20` (wall) at `x=0`.
           
           Rover `v14` (rock analysis):
           - Initial position: `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           - Rocks to sample: `v3` (type v2, at (-1.8, -1.2)) and `v8` (type v6, at (0.6, -1.2)).
           - Lander `v9` for communication: AABB `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
           
           Revised configurations for `v14` (keeping them very close to `v15` or in direct line of sight):
           - `#o0` for `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`: `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). `v9` is at (-1.9, -2.0).
               A reachable point near `v15` that can see `v9` and is not colliding with `v9` or `v20`.
               `v9` is to the left of `v14`. Let's try `(-1.5, -1.75)`. This is only 0.5 units away from `v15`, to the left.
               It should be collision-free with `v9` since `v9`'s max_x is -1.395, and `v14` will be at x=-1.5.
           
           Rover `v12` (image acquisition and transmission):
           - Initial position: `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           - Objectives: `v17` (0.4, 1.8), `v18` (-0.4, 1.8), `v19` (-1.8, 1.8).
           - Lander `v9` for communication: AABB `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
           
           Revised configurations for `v12`:
           - `#o3` for `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`: `v17` is at (0.4, 1.8). `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
               To be reachable and see `v17` (max dist 2), a config like `(0.8, 0.0)` for `#o3` (for `v17`) should work. It is right of `v20` and reachable from `v13`.
           - `#o3` for `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`: `v18` is at (-0.4, 1.8). `v12` needs to cross `v20`.
               A config like `(-0.8, 0.0)` for `#o3` (for `v18`). It is left of `v20` and should be reachable from `v13` by going around the wall. However, this is quite a long move (from 1.0 to -0.8 x-coord). The problem stated `motion` predicates for movements. It seems that `motion(v12, q1, #o2, q2)` exists for various `q1, q2` including `#o0, #o3, #o5, v13, v15`.
               This implies the path is traversable even across the wall by going around or some other means.
               Let's try to stick to configurations that are closer to the objects for imaging, while respecting the wall.
               For `v18` (-0.4, 1.8): `(-0.8, 0.5)` for `#o3`.
           - `#o3` for `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)`: `v19` is at (-1.8, 1.8).
               For `v19`: `(-1.5, 0.5)` for `#o3`.
           - `#o0` for `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`: `v9` is at (-1.9, -2.0). `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
               `v12` needs to go to the left of the wall for comm with `v9`. `(-1.0, -1.75)` for `#o0`. This config is very close to `v14`'s initial config, which is fine.
           
           The relative positions for the motion actions (`#o2`) are just symbols for continuous paths. I'm assuming that the `move` actions will find valid paths between the given start and end configurations, provided those configurations are reachable and collision-free.
           
           Let's try these configurations:

Configuration #o3 = (-1.5 0.5) for rover v12 at target v19 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-1.0 -1.75) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The repeated issues with reachability for `v12` and collision with `v9` for `v14` indicate that the robot's movement capabilities or the environment's constraints are tighter than initially assumed. Specifically, `v9`'s AABB being `([-2.4047, -2.34555], [-1.3953, -1.6544])` means my chosen point `(-1.5, -1.75)` for `v14` is indeed inside the lander `v9`. I need to place `v14`'s comm point outside `v9`'s bounding box.
           
           Let's carefully choose new configurations:
           
           Rover `v14` (rock analysis):
           - Initial position: `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           - Lander `v9` for communication: AABB `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
           - For `#o0` for `v14` to communicate with `v9`: I need a point that is outside `v9`'s AABB, to the left of `v20` (wall), and reachable from `v15`.
               `v9`'s `max_x` is -1.395. So, `x` should be greater than -1.395 to be on its right, or less than -2.405 to be on its left. `v14` is at `x = -1.0`.
               A configuration like `(-0.9, -2.0)` would be to the right of `v9`'s `max_x`, near `v14`'s initial `x`, and below `v9`. This would be a better candidate for `(-0.9, -2.0)`. This should be clear of `v9` and `v20`.
           
           Rover `v12` (image acquisition and transmission):
           - Initial position: `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           - Objectives: `v17` (0.4, 1.8), `v18` (-0.4, 1.8), `v19` (-1.8, 1.8).
           - Lander `v9` for communication: AABB `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
           
           Revised configurations for `v12` (focus on reachability from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) and `v20` (wall at x=0)):
           - `#o3` for `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`: `v17` is at (0.4, 1.8). `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
               A point very close to `v13` that can see `v17`. `(0.9, 0.0)` for `#o3` for `v17`. This is still on the right side of `v20`. This configuration is a short move from (1.0, -1.75) to (0.9, 0.0), a total move of `sqrt((0.9-1.0)^2 + (0.0 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.01 + 1.75^2) approx 1.75`. This should be reachable and within max image distance 2 to `v17`.
           - `#o3` for `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`: `v18` is at (-0.4, 1.8). `v12` needs to cross `v20`.
               This implies the path `motion(v12, q1, #o2, q2)` is capable of crossing the wall in terms of finding a path *around* it, not through it. Given `v12` starts at (1.0, -1.75) and needs to reach `x < 0` for `v18` and `v19`, it's a significant movement. Let's try to put `#o3` (for `v18`) on the left of `v20`. A position like `(-0.9, 0.0)` is a symmetric option to `(0.9, 0.0)`.
           - `#o3` for `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)`: `v19` is at (-1.8, 1.8).
               For `v19`, a position like `(-1.5, 0.0)`.
           - `#o0` for `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`: `v9` is at (-1.9, -2.0). `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
               Again, `v12` needs to cross `v20`. A position like `(-1.0, -2.0)` is relatively close to `v9` and not colliding. This location is outside of `v9`'s bounding box and on the left side of `v20`. This configuration is a fair distance away from `v13`'s starting point, but `motion` should allow it.
           
           The configurations should be such that the *base* of the robot can reach them. The previous points were likely invalid because they were still in collision or not truly reachable given the robot's size/kinematics.
           
           Let's use the plan structure from before, as it logically follows the goals.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The consistent "not reachable for robot base" errors for all proposed configurations are problematic. This suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of the rover's kinematics or the definition of "reachable." Given the robot's starting points and the target locations, it seems the possible movement range is very restricted, or the path planning is more complex than just picking points.
           
           Let's assume the problem means "reachable from the current configuration via `motion` predicates." If a simple move to nearby coordinates is not considered reachable, then the robot must have severe restrictions on movement, or some implied obstacles. The only explicit obstacles are `v9` and `v20`.
           
           Let's try to interpret "reachable" as *extremely* close to the starting position or along a path very similar to its initial coordinates if possible.
           
           Rover `v14` (rock analysis):
           - Initial position: `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           - Lander `v9`: AABB `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
           - For `#o0` for `v14` to communicate with `v9`:
               To be reachable from `(-1.0, -1.75)`, and to the right of `v9`'s max_x of -1.395.
               Try `(-1.2, -1.75)`. This is very close to `v15`, only moving left along the x-axis. It is outside of `v9`'s bounding box and to the left of `v20`. This should maximize reachability.
           
           Rover `v12` (image acquisition and transmission):
           - Initial position: `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           - Objectives: `v17` (0.4, 1.8), `v18` (-0.4, 1.8), `v19` (-1.8, 1.8).
           - Lander `v9`: AABB `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
           
           Revised configurations for `v12`:
           - `#o3` for `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`: `v17` is at (0.4, 1.8). `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
               To be reachable and see `v17`. `v17` is relatively far in y. If `(0.9, 0.0)` was not reachable, then maybe closer to initial y? `(0.9, -1.0)` is closer to initial y. It's on the right of `v20`. Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) is `sqrt((0.9-1.0)^2 + (-1.0 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.01 + 0.75^2) approx 0.75`. This is very close.
           - `#o3` for `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`: `v18` is at (-0.4, 1.8). `v12` needs to cross `v20`.
               This implies the "reachable" issue is about the end point, not the path.
               A configuration very close to `v12`'s current side of `v20` would be `(0.1, -1.75)`. But this cannot see `v18` (left of wall).
               A point just to the left of `v20` near `v12`'s initial y. `(-0.1, -1.75)` for `#o3`. Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `(-0.1, -1.75)` is `1.1` units. This is very reachable in x-coordinate and same y-coordinate.
           - `#o3` for `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)`: `v19` is at (-1.8, 1.8).
               Similar logic, further left from `v20`. `(-0.5, -1.75)`. Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `(-0.5, -1.75)` is `1.5` units.
           - `#o0` for `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`: `v9` is at (-1.9, -2.0). `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
               Again, very close to `v12`'s initial y, but on the left of `v20`, and not colliding with `v9`.
               `v9`'s max_x is -1.395. So `x` should be greater than -1.395 to be on its right side.
               Try `(-1.3, -1.75)`. This is a short move from `v13` in x-direction (`2.3` units), same y-coordinate, not colliding with `v9` or `v20`.
           
           This approach aims to make the configurations minimally displaced from the starting positions along the x-axis, assuming movement along the y-axis is harder. The `motion` predicates support moves between many configurations, so the path is likely handled by the system. The issue is purely the reachability of the *target configuration point* for the robot base.

Model:     The continuous configuration attempts are consistently failing for a variety of reasons: not reachable, collision, or out of range. This is becoming increasingly difficult and suggests that the environment is very constrained, or the robot's capabilities are extremely limited.
           
           Let's break down the problems and re-evaluate each configuration with precise geometric reasoning:
           
           **Robot Bounding Box:** I don't have the robot's bounding box, so I'm assuming it's a point for collision checking against `v9` and `v20`. If not, this is a major source of error. I will use a conservative buffer around the obstacles.
           
           **Obstacles:**
           - `v9` (lander): AABB `((-2.4047, -2.34555), (-1.3953, -1.65445))`.
           - `v20` (wall): AABB `((-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), (0.05, 2.5, 0.1))`. This is a thin vertical strip at `x=0`.
           
           **Rover `v14` (rock analysis):**
           - Initial position `v15`: (-1.0, -1.75).
           - Target `v9` for communication:
               Previous attempt `(-1.2, -1.75)` collided with `v9`. This is because `v9`'s max_x is -1.3953. `(-1.2, -1.75)` is indeed inside `v9`.
               I need `x > -1.3953` OR `x < -2.4047`. Since `v14` starts at `x = -1.0`, moving right of `v9` is better.
               Let's try `x = -1.3` (just right of `v9`'s bounding box). `y = -1.75` is within `v9`'s y range `(-2.34555, -1.65445)`. So `(-1.3, -1.75)` will still collide in y.
               I need to pick `y` outside of `(-2.34555, -1.65445)`.
               So, if `x = -1.3`, then `y` should be, for instance, `y = -1.5` (above `v9`) or `y = -2.4` (below `v9`).
               Let's try to place `v14` for `v9` communication at `(-1.3, -1.5)`. This is just outside `v9`'s top-right corner, and very close to `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). This should be reachable. Distance from `v15` to `(-1.3, -1.5)` is `sqrt((-1.3 - (-1.0))^2 + (-1.5 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-0.3)^2 + (0.25)^2) = sqrt(0.09 + 0.0625) = sqrt(0.1525) approx 0.39`. This is a very short move and should be reachable.
           
           **Rover `v12` (image acquisition and transmission):**
           - Initial position `v13`: (1.0, -1.75).
           - For `#o3` for `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`: `v17` is at (0.4, 1.8). Max range 2.
               Previous `(0.9, -1.0)` was not reachable. This is unusual for such a short distance.
               Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `(0.9, -1.0)` is `sqrt((0.9-1.0)^2 + (-1.0 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.01 + 0.5625) = sqrt(0.5725) approx 0.75`. Very short distance.
               The only reason it would not be reachable is if there's an implicit obstacle or very tight movement constraints.
               Let's try to stay at `y = -1.75`. `(0.6, -1.75)`. This is right of `v20`. Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `(0.6, -1.75)` is `0.4`. Extremely short.
               Distance from `(0.6, -1.75)` to `v17` (0.4, 1.8) is `sqrt((0.6-0.4)^2 + (-1.75 - 1.8)^2) = sqrt(0.04 + (-3.55)^2) = sqrt(0.04 + 12.6025) = sqrt(12.6425) approx 3.55`. This is outside the max image range of 2.
           
           This suggests that for imaging objects at `y=1.8`, the rover needs to move significantly in the y-direction. If moving from `y=-1.75` to `y=0.0` or `y=0.5` is not reachable, then `v12` cannot take images of the `v17, v18, v19` objects.
           
           If the rover cannot reach (0.9, 0.0) from (1.0, -1.75), and similar moves are failing for other targets, there might be a very low range or a path constraint for the robot `v12` specifically.
           
           What if the default starting configurations `v13` and `v15` are the *only* reachable points, or points very close to them? This would drastically limit image and communication tasks.
           
           Let's assume the "reachable" means a very small radius.
           - For `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75):
               To image `v17` (0.4, 1.8), `v12` needs to get closer.
               This implies the imaging task is potentially not feasible if the robot cannot move significantly in Y.
               Let's check `imagevisible` preconditions: `imagevisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o)`. This does not imply that `?o` needs to be in `?v`'s `FOV`. It only says that `?q` (rover configuration) to `?o` (objective) is image visible.
           
           If I cannot choose configurations far from the initial ones, then `v12` cannot image targets at `y=1.8` from `y=-1.75`. The range is too far. The maximum distance for imagevisible is 2.
           Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `v17` (0.4, 1.8) is `sqrt((1.0-0.4)^2 + (-1.75-1.8)^2) = sqrt(0.36 + (-3.55)^2) = sqrt(0.36 + 12.6025) = sqrt(12.9625) approx 3.6`. This is greater than 2.
           This implies that `v12` *must* move closer in the y-axis to take images. If these movements are "not reachable," then the image-taking part of the goal is fundamentally unachievable.
           
           Let me carefully re-examine the `motion` predicates. They are of the form `motion(v, q1, #o2, q2)`. `#o2` represents a trajectory. It simply says a motion *exists* between those configs.
           
           Is it possible that the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates in the initial state are the *only* valid configurations for those tasks?
           `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` means that there IS a configuration #o3 for v12 from which v17 is visible. But I must find such a #o3.
           If I put `v12` to (0.4, 0.0), then distance to `v17` (0.4, 1.8) is `1.8`. This is within 2. But `(0.4, 0.0)` for `v12` would collide with `v20` (`x=0` wall, width 0.1). So `x` needs to be outside `(-0.05, 0.05)`.
           Let's try `(0.1, 0.0)` for `v12` to image `v17`. Distance to `v17` (0.4, 1.8) is `sqrt((0.1-0.4)^2 + (0.0-1.8)^2) = sqrt(0.09 + 3.24) = sqrt(3.33) approx 1.82`. This is within 2.
           This should be collision-free. But is `(0.1, 0.0)` reachable from `(1.0, -1.75)`? Given previous failures, maybe not.
           
           This leads me to believe the problem is unachievable given the implicit constraints on "reachable." However, I cannot state the problem is unachievable without exhausting all options. The current repeated "not reachable" errors are generic. I will assume the robot can move if the path is clear and the distance is not excessively large. The fact that the `motion` predicate arguments involve `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`, `v13`, `v15` implies these points are somehow connected.
           
           Let's assume the previous calculated configurations *are* reachable, and the error is due to a very tight collision or occlusion check.
           
           Final attempt strategy:
           - For `v14` to communicate with `v9` (`#o0`):
               `v9` AABB: `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
               `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
               Let's place `#o0` at `(-1.3, -1.55)`. This is just outside the top-right corner of `v9` and very close to `v15`. `x=-1.3` is greater than `v9.maxx = -1.395`. `y=-1.55` is greater than `v9.maxy = -1.654`. So it should be collision free. And distance from `v15` is small.
           - For `v12` to image `v17` (`#o3`): `v17` at (0.4, 1.8). `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
               Max image range is 2. Need to move in Y. Place `#o3` for `v17` at `(0.1, 0.0)`. This point is clear of `v20`. Distance to `v17` is 1.82 (within 2). Reachable from `v13`? The distance is `sqrt((1.0-0.1)^2 + (-1.75-0.0)^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 3.0625) = sqrt(3.8725) approx 1.96`. This is a reasonable movement.
           - For `v12` to image `v18` (`#o3`): `v18` at (-0.4, 1.8).
               Place `#o3` for `v18` at `(-0.1, 0.0)`. This point is clear of `v20` (just left of it). Distance to `v18` is `sqrt((-0.1 - (-0.4))^2 + (0.0 - 1.8)^2) = sqrt(0.09 + 3.24) = sqrt(3.33) approx 1.82`. This is within 2. Reachable from previous `(0.1, 0.0)`? Yes, small move across `v20` (assuming `motion` handles it). Reachable from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) is `sqrt((1.0 - (-0.1))^2 + (-1.75 - 0.0)^2) = sqrt(1.21 + 3.0625) = sqrt(4.2725) approx 2.06`. This is slightly beyond a hypothetical "max move distance 2" but less than 4 for comms.
           - For `v12` to image `v19` (`#o3`): `v19` at (-1.8, 1.8).
               Place `#o3` for `v19` at `(-1.0, 0.0)`. Distance to `v19` is `sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.8))^2 + (0.0 - 1.8)^2) = sqrt(0.64 + 3.24) = sqrt(3.88) approx 1.97`. This is within 2. Reachable from `(-0.1, 0.0)`? Yes.
           - For `v12` to communicate with `v9` (`#o0`): `v9` at (-1.9, -2.0). Max comm range 4.
               Place `#o0` for `v9` at `(-1.3, -1.55)`. This is the same point as for `v14` to `v9` (if possible). Distance to `v9` (center approx -1.9, -2.0) is small. Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `(-1.3, -1.55)` is `sqrt((1.0 - (-1.3))^2 + (-1.75 - (-1.55))^2) = sqrt(2.3^2 + (-0.2)^2) = sqrt(5.29 + 0.04) = sqrt(5.33) approx 2.3`. This seems reasonable.
           
           This set of configurations tries to minimize movements and avoid previous collision/range issues. If these fail due to "not reachable", then the robot's mobility is extremely restricted such that the task might be genuinely unachievable with the given parameters.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The situation is becoming very clear: the robot's base seems unable to cross the `x=0` line (the `v20` obstacle) to reach the other side of the environment, or its reachability is extremely limited for any significant y-movement. The obstacle `v20` is a wall from `x=-0.05` to `x=0.05`. My attempts to place configurations at `(0.1, Y)` and `(-0.1, Y)` are always in collision. This means the robot itself must have some width greater than `0.05` in x, or the collision detection is using a buffer.
           
           Given `v20`'s AABB: `((-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), (0.05, 2.5, 0.1))`.
           - A point like `(0.1, Y)` means `x=0.1`. This is outside the wall's x-range (0.05 is max). So, it should not be in collision unless the robot itself has a width that overlaps, or there's a buffer.
           - Similarly, `(-0.1, Y)` with `x=-0.1` should be outside the wall's x-range (-0.05 is min).
           
           The "not reachable" errors are still prevalent even for small displacements. This is the critical problem. If the robot cannot reach points just a few units away from its starting position, it cannot perform any useful tasks.
           
           Let's assume the robot is very wide, for instance, a width of `0.2` (meaning `x` positions from `-0.1` to `0.1` would collide with the wall centered at `x=0`). If so, I need to place configurations further away from `x=0`.
           
           New strategy considering a wider robot that cannot be at `x` between `(-0.1, 0.1)` for example.
           Also, the "not reachable for robot base" is the most frequent error. This suggests the robot *really* cannot move much.
           
           Let's rethink everything:
           - Rover `v14` starts at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           - Rover `v12` starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           
           If they cannot move far, they need to accomplish tasks from very close to their starting positions.
           
           **Rover `v14` (rock analysis):**
           - `#o0` for `v14` to `v9`: `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). `v9` is at `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
               To avoid collision and stay reachable: The only option is to be very close to `v15`. `v15` is at `x=-1.0`. `v9` max `x` is -1.395. So `v14` at `x=-1.0` is already to the right of `v9`.
               `v9` y range is `(-2.345, -1.654)`. `v14` is at `y=-1.75`. This is *inside* `v9`'s y range. So `(-1.0, -1.75)` is colliding with `v9`.
               I need to move `v14` out of `v9`'s y range.
               Let's try `(-1.0, -1.6)`. This is just above `v9`'s max_y, and exactly `0.15` from `v15`. Very small move. Max dist for `comvisible` is 4. Distance to center of `v9` (approx -1.9, -2.0) from `(-1.0, -1.6)` is `sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.9))^2 + (-1.6 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt(0.9^2 + 0.4^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 0.16) = sqrt(0.97) approx 0.98`. This is well within 4.
           
           **Rover `v12` (image acquisition and transmission):**
           - `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           - `v20` (wall) at `x=0` (from `-0.05` to `0.05`).
           - `#o3` for `v12` to `v17` (0.4, 1.8):
               `v12` is at `x=1.0`. `v17` is at `x=0.4`. Both are right of `v20`.
               Max image range is 2. Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `v17` (0.4, 1.8) is approx 3.6 (too far).
               This confirms `v12` must move significantly in `y` to image `v17, v18, v19`. If any such `y` move is not "reachable," the problem is unsolvable for imaging.
               Let's try to stick to `y=-1.75` for `v12` as much as possible, or a minimal change.
               Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `v17` (0.4, 1.8). If I place `v12` at `(0.8, -0.5)`, distance to `v17` is `sqrt((0.8-0.4)^2 + (-0.5-1.8)^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 5.29) = sqrt(5.45) approx 2.3`. Still too far.
               This imaging goal for `v12` seems impossible if it can't move to higher y coordinates.
           
           Let's assume there is some configuration available with `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates, *but the planner is too strict on reachability for my manually chosen continuous parameters*. The wording "If your plan uses some object #<name>... then you must provide a continuous value..." suggests I *must* find such values.
           
           The previous error for `(0.1, 0.0)` for `v12` at `v17` colliding with `v20` means that the robot body itself is wide. If `v20` is `x=[-0.05, 0.05]`, and a robot at `x=0.1` collides, it means its leftmost extent is `0.1 - (robot_width / 2) <= 0.05`. So `robot_width / 2 >= 0.05`. Robot width is at least `0.1`.
           This means, to be collision-free from `v20`, the center of the robot must be at `x >= 0.05 + robot_width/2` or `x <= -0.05 - robot_width/2`. Let's assume a robot width of `0.2`. So `x` should be `x >= 0.15` or `x <= -0.15`.
           
           **Rover `v12` (image acquisition and transmission) - New Configurations:**
           - `#o3` for `v12` to `v17` (0.4, 1.8):
               `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
               Need `x >= 0.15`. Let's use `(0.2, 0.0)`. Distance to `v17` is `sqrt((0.2-0.4)^2 + (0.0-1.8)^2) = sqrt(0.04 + 3.24) = sqrt(3.28) approx 1.81`. This is within 2.
               Reachable from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `(0.2, 0.0)` is `sqrt((1.0-0.2)^2 + (-1.75-0.0)^2) = sqrt(0.64 + 3.0625) = sqrt(3.7025) approx 1.92`. This is a reasonable movement.
           - `#o3` for `v12` to `v18` (-0.4, 1.8):
               Need `x <= -0.15`. Let's use `(-0.2, 0.0)`. Distance to `v18` is `sqrt((-0.2 - (-0.4))^2 + (0.0 - 1.8)^2) = sqrt(0.04 + 3.24) = sqrt(3.28) approx 1.81`. Within 2.
               Reachable from previous `(0.2, 0.0)`? This is a `0.4` unit x-move. Reachable from `v13` is `sqrt((1.0 - (-0.2))^2 + (-1.75 - 0.0)^2) = sqrt(1.44 + 3.0625) = sqrt(4.5025) approx 2.12`. This might fail on reachability if the limit is strictly 2.
           - `#o3` for `v12` to `v19` (-1.8, 1.8):
               Use `(-1.0, 0.0)`. This is left of `v20`. Distance to `v19` is `sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.8))^2 + (0.0 - 1.8)^2) = sqrt(0.64 + 3.24) = sqrt(3.88) approx 1.97`. Within 2.
               Reachable from `v13` is `sqrt((1.0 - (-1.0))^2 + (-1.75 - 0.0)^2) = sqrt(4.0 + 3.0625) = sqrt(7.0625) approx 2.65`. This will definitely fail reachability.
           
           Given that `(-1.0, 0.0)` for `v19` fails reachability when calculated from `v13` (2.65 distance), and even `(-0.2, 0.0)` for `v18` is 2.12. This tells me the movement constraint is probably around 2 units total distance.
           
           This means `v12` cannot reach `y=0.0` and `x<0` from `v13` (`1.0, -1.75`).
           Thus, `v12` cannot image `v18` or `v19`. This means `receivedimage(v18, v11)` and `receivedimage(v19, v11)` cannot be achieved by `v12`.
           
           Let's check if `v14` can image `v18` or `v19`.
           `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           `v18` is at (-0.4, 1.8).
           `v19` is at (-1.8, 1.8).
           `v14` is on the left side of `v20`.
           For `v14` to image `v18`: try `(-0.2, 0.0)`. Distance to `v18` is 1.81. Reachable from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `(-0.2, 0.0)` is `sqrt((-1.0 - (-0.2))^2 + (-1.75 - 0.0)^2) = sqrt(0.64 + 3.0625) = sqrt(3.7025) approx 1.92`. This is reachable for `v14`.
           For `v14` to image `v19`: try `(-1.0, 0.0)`. Distance to `v19` is 1.97. Reachable from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `(-1.0, 0.0)` is `sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.0))^2 + (-1.75 - 0.0)^2) = sqrt(0 + 3.0625) approx 1.75`. This is reachable for `v14`.
           
           So, `v14` should image `v18` and `v19`. `v12` should image `v17`.
           
           **Redistributed tasks:**
           - **Rover `v14`**:
               1. Sample `v3` (type v2) and `v8` (type v6).
               2. Send analysis for both.
               3. Image `v18` and `v19`.
               4. Send images for `v18` and `v19`.
           - **Rover `v12`**:
               1. Image `v17`.
               2. Send image for `v17`.
           
           This is a complete re-plan.
           Let's specify configs:
           **Rover `v14` (init at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)):**
           - `#o0` for `v14` to `v9`: `(-1.0, -1.6)` (collision-free with `v9`, reachable from `v15`, dist 0.15).
           - `#o3` for `v14` to `v18`: `(-0.2, 0.0)` (collision-free with `v20`, dist to `v18` 1.81, reachable from `v15` dist 1.92).
           - `#o3` for `v14` to `v19`: `(-1.0, 0.0)` (collision-free with `v20`, dist to `v19` 1.97, reachable from `v15` dist 1.75).
           **Rover `v12` (init at `v13` (1.0, -1.75)):**
           - `#o3` for `v12` to `v17`: `(0.2, 0.0)` (collision-free with `v20`, dist to `v17` 1.81, reachable from `v13` dist 1.92).
           - `#o0` for `v12` to `v9`: `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). Need to move to left of `v20`. But if `(-0.1, Y)` is collision, then `(-1.0, Y)` is very far.
               The goal is `receivedimage(v17, v11)`. `v12` needs to take and send this.
               For `v12` to send image of `v17`: `v12` needs to be `comvisible` to `v9`.
               If `v12` cannot cross `v20`, it cannot send images of any objectives to `v9` (which is on the left). `v9` is at `x = [-2.4, -1.39]`. `v12` starts at `x = 1.0`. Any communication point on the right of `v20` would be too far from `v9`. Distance from `(0.2, -1.75)` to `v9` is too large.
               This means if `v12` can only operate on the right side of `v20`, it cannot communicate with `v9`.
               This implies the task is not achievable if the robot cannot cross the `v20` barrier. The "not reachable" from `(-0.1, 0.0)` and `(0.1, 0.0)` for `v12` suggests it cannot get very close to the wall (i.e. `x` needs to be `>0.15` or `< -0.15`).
           
           It seems the `motion` predicates must imply ability to cross the wall for at least one rover, otherwise image and communication for targets across the wall are impossible. The repeated `not reachable` and `collision with v20` for configurations like `(0.1, 0.0)` and `(-0.1, 0.0)` for `v12` means the rover likely occupies a significant area and cannot squeeze through the tiny gap at `x=0`.
           
           If `v12` is stuck on the right, it cannot fulfill the goal `receivedimage(v18, v11)` and `receivedimage(v19, v11)` or send `v17` image.
           If `v14` is stuck on the left, it cannot fulfill `receivedimage(v17, v11)` or sample `v8` (which is at `x=0.6`).
           
           This points to the goal being unachievable if the robots are truly confined to one side of the `v20` barrier, and if any configuration that would allow them to image or communicate across the barrier is considered "not reachable" or in "collision." Given the repeated failures, this is a strong possibility. However, I must try until there is no logical path.
           
           Let's assume the `motion` predicate can *magically* transport the robot across the wall, if the target configuration is collision-free. And that the definition of `reachable` is about the direct distance to a point, not pathfinding.
           The core issue is that the robot has an implicit size that makes `x=0.1` and `x=-0.1` collide. So, I need to place configurations further from the wall (e.g., `x=0.2` and `x=-0.2` or more).
           
           **Final revised configurations based on this assumption (robot width = 0.2, so avoid `x` from `(-0.1, 0.1)`):**
           
           **Rover `v14` (init at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)):**
           - `#o0` for `v14` to `v9`: `(-1.0, -1.6)` (Collision-free with `v9`, reachable from `v15`, dist ~0.15, comm dist ~0.98).
           
           **Rover `v12` (init at `v13` (1.0, -1.75)):**
           - `#o3` for `v12` to `v17`: `(0.2, 0.0)` (Collision-free with `v20`, dist to `v17` 1.81, reachable from `v13` dist 1.92).
           - `#o3` for `v12` to `v18`: `(-0.2, 0.0)` (Collision-free with `v20`, dist to `v18` 1.81. This config is `x=-0.2`, so it's a cross-wall move for `v12`).
           - `#o3` for `v12` to `v19`: `(-1.0, 0.0)` (Collision-free with `v20`, dist to `v19` 1.97. Another cross-wall move).
           - `#o0` for `v12` to `v9`: `(-1.0, -1.6)` (Same as for `v14`, this assumes `v12` can reach this point). Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `(-1.0, -1.6)` is `sqrt((1.0 - (-1.0))^2 + (-1.75 - (-1.6))^2) = sqrt(2.0^2 + (-0.15)^2) = sqrt(4.0 + 0.0225) = sqrt(4.0225) approx 2.005`. This is right at the edge of "reachable" if max_dist is 2. Let's try `(-0.8, -1.6)` instead, shorter move, still clear of `v20` and `v9`. Dist from `v13` to `(-0.8, -1.6)` is `sqrt((1.0 - (-0.8))^2 + (-1.75 - (-1.6))^2) = sqrt(1.8^2 + (-0.15)^2) = sqrt(3.24 + 0.0225) = sqrt(3.2625) approx 1.80`. This should be reachable.
           
           The plan sequence remains the same.
           The problem is that the image and analysis targets are distributed across the map and the wall `v20` creates a major division.
           Rover `v14` will do analysis for `v3` (left of wall) and `v8` (right of wall). This means `v14` must cross the wall.
           `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o5)` and `motion(v14, #o5, #o2, #o0)` etc.
           If `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)` and needs to sample `v8` at `(0.6, -1.2)`, it needs to move to `#o5` which will be on the right side of `v20`. For example, `(0.5, -1.2)`. The total distance for this is `sqrt((-1.0-0.5)^2 + (-1.75 - (-1.2))^2) = sqrt(2.25 + 0.3025) = sqrt(2.5525) approx 1.6`. This seems fine.
           
           The current strategy assumes that moving across `v20` is possible via `motion`, but that the landing configurations must be outside of `v20`'s width (and any implicit robot width).

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The repeated errors highlight a severe set of constraints that I am failing to accurately model. The critical points are:
           1.  **`v20` collision:** The robot's actual size appears to be larger than I'm assuming, or the collision buffer is very generous. A configuration at `x=0.2` (for `v12`) or `x=-0.2` (for `v12`) is still colliding with `v20` `(x=[-0.05, 0.05])`. This means the robot's width in the x-direction is likely `0.3` or more. If `robot_width/2` is `0.15`, then `x` must be outside `x = [-0.05 - 0.15, 0.05 + 0.15] = [-0.2, 0.2]`. So configurations must be `x <= -0.2` or `x >= 0.2`. My recent choices are directly on these boundaries and still fail. This means the robot is even wider, or has a larger buffer.
           2.  **Reachability:** Even very short moves (e.g., `0.15` units for `v14` from `v15` to `(-1.0, -1.6)`) are failing the "not reachable" check. This is highly unusual for a mobile robot unless the initial configuration is almost strictly fixed, or movement is only allowed along specific axes/paths not generally available. The `motion` predicates in the initial state connecting generic `#o` configurations and `v13`/`v15` *should* imply that these are reachable.
           
           Given these extreme limitations, I have to assume the robot can barely move from its initial position. If this is the case, the goal as stated, requiring images and analyses of objects spread across the map and separated by `v20`, becomes unachievable.
           
           Let's make one final attempt by assuming the robot can *only* move to configurations that are identical to `v13` or `v15` themselves, or extremely close variants of these if required for collision/visibility. If these still fail, it implies the problem is unachievable with the given robot and environment.
           
           **Hypothesis:** The "not reachable" error means the target configuration is too far, or the path to it is entirely blocked by complex geometry (beyond simple AABBs). The `v20` collision means the robot cannot traverse the `x=0` zone.
           
           This means:
           - `v12` is stuck on the right side of `v20` (`x > 0`).
           - `v14` is stuck on the left side of `v20` (`x < 0`).
           
           **If `v12` is stuck on the right side (x > 0):**
           - It *cannot* image `v18` (-0.4, 1.8) or `v19` (-1.8, 1.8) due to `v20` obstruction.
           - It *cannot* communicate with `v9` (-1.9, -2.0) due to `v20` obstruction.
           - The goal requires `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`.
               `v17` is at (0.4, 1.8), so it's on the right side.
               If `v12` is limited to `x > 0`, can it image `v17`? Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `v17` (0.4, 1.8) is approx 3.6, which is >2 (max image range). So `v12` must move significantly in Y. If such moves are "not reachable," then `v17` cannot be imaged.
           
           **If `v14` is stuck on the left side (x < 0):**
           - It *cannot* sample `v8` (0.6, -1.2) due to `v20` obstruction.
               The goal requires `receivedanalysis(?soil)` which needs a rock of type `v6`. `v8` (0.6, -1.2) is type `v6`. `v5` (0.879, 1.027) is also type `v6`. Both are on the right side of `v20`. So, if `v14` is stuck left, it cannot analyze a rock of type `v6`.
           - It *can* sample `v3` (-1.8, -1.2) (type `v2`), as `v3` is on the left side.
           - It *can* communicate with `v9` (-1.9, -2.0).
           
           **Conclusion based on these very strict interpretations:**
           The goals `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (using `v8` or `v5`) are unachievable. This makes the overall goal `new-axiom@0()` unachievable.
           
           I am forced to conclude that the goal is not achievable from the initial state given the repeated "not reachable" and "collision with v20" errors that prevent robots from accessing necessary parts of the map or imaging/sampling distant objects. The problem statement demands that *all* preconditions are met. If a robot cannot reach a point to take an image or sample a rock, that part of the plan is invalid. My attempts to select 'reachable' points have all been rejected. The distribution of objectives and the wall `v20` make the combined task impossible with such strict movement constraints.
           
           No plan will be returned as the goal appears unachievable.
