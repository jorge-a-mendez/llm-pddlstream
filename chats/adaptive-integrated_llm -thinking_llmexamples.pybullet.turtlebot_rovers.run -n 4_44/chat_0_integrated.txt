           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           My objective is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which requires establishing several conditions, including *receivedimage* and *receivedanalysis*. My initial approach was to work backwards from these goals, identifying the necessary actions: *take_image* and *send_image* for images, and *sample_rock* and *send_analysis* for analyses.  However, this plan runs into a critical roadblock.
           
           My initial state places me (rover v12 or v14) at configurations v13 or v15, respectively, and the plan requires these configurations remain true at the end.  Crucially, however, the necessary actions for achieving the goals (*take_image*, *send_image*, *sample_rock*, *send_analysis*) require me to be at different, specific configurations:  *imagevisible* and *calibrate* need me to be at configuration #o3, *comvisible* and *send_analysis* need me at #o0, and *sample_rock* needs me at #o5.
           
           The problem lies in the permissible actions: I *cannot* move to these necessary configurations! The `move` actions are limited to staying at the initial configurations. The problem specifies that only `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)` are valid moves - these are effectively no-ops.
           
           Since I am restricted to my starting locations, I cannot satisfy the preconditions for the actions needed to produce the desired facts, *receivedimage* and *receivedanalysis*. The conditions needed for these facts will thus never be met and the goal will not be achievable.
