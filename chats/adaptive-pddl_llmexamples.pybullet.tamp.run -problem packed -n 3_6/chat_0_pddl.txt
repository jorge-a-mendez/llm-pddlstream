           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes several objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`) that are `graspable` and `stackable` onto different receptacles (`v10`, `v11`, `v16`). There are two arms (`v4`, `v6`) and two arm configurations (`v5`, `v7`). The robot is currently at base configuration `v3`.
           
           The initial state shows that:
           - `v8` is currently at `v9` and supported by `v11`.
           - `v12` is currently at `v13` and supported by `v11`.
           - `v14` is currently at `v15` and supported by `v11`.
           - The robot's arm `v4` is empty and at configuration `v5`.
           - The robot's arm `v6` is empty and at configuration `v7`.
           - The robot can move.
           
           The goal is to have `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all on `v16`. Since `on(?o, ?r)` is an axiom that depends on `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`, this means we need to place each object (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`) into a new pose `#o2` where it is supported by `v16`.
           
           Looking at the available action instances, only one action is provided: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action moves the robot's base from `v3` to `v3` using trajectory `#o0`. This action doesn't change the state of any of the objects regarding their placement. It only moves the base, and since the start and end configurations are the same, it essentially means the robot stays in the same place.
           
           To achieve the goal of putting objects on `v16`, the robot would need to perform `pick` and `place` actions. However, no `pick` or `place` action instances are provided, nor are `clean` or `cook` actions.
           
           Since the `pick` and `place` actions are necessary to move the objects, and no such actions are available in the provided list of valid action instances, the goal is unachievable with the given information.
           
           No plan can be generated because the necessary actions to move the objects (`pick` and `place`) are not available in the provided action instances.
