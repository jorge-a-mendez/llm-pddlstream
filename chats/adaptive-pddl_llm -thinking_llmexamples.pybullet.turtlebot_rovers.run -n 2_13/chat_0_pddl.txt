           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Unreachable Axiom**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. This seemingly straightforward goal hides a complex web of requirements: I need to ensure a specific state involving configurations (represented by `atconf` and `free` predicates), but crucially, I must receive and analyze images and samples. More specifically, I need to get `receivedimage` for two images (`v17`, `v18`) of a source (`v11`), and I must receive and analyze samples of two distinct types of rock (`v2` and `v6`).
           
           Initially, the situation is clear on the configuration level (`atconf` and `free` predicates hold true), the challenge lies in obtaining the image and analysis data. I can see the possible objects that could satisfy the `type` predicate and, consequently, could satisfy the `receivedanalysis` predicates - that would require analysis of the correct rock type.
           
           However, the problem statement provides only a limited set of allowed actions. Examining these actions carefully, I see that I can only `move` between points and `drop_rock`. There is no way I can satisfy the images and analysis requirements using only these available action instances. Given the provided action instances, I cannot `take_image`, nor can I `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`. These operations are *essential* to achieving the required preconditions. It's a complete mismatch.
           
           Let me confirm that I understand the constraints: "You are only allowed to use the provided actions". And yes, I clearly have been restricted to this set. Therefore, given the available action instances, the objective `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable. It's an impossible task within the provided framework.
