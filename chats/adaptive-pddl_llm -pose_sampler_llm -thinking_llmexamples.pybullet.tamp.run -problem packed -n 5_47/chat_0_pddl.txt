(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Square Objects**
           
           My objective is to generate 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 6) of side length 0.09372664882763859 on a square surface (Surface 0) of dimensions 0.27 x 0.27, centered at (0,0) and defined by the bounds (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  Since this is the initial request, no collision avoidance with previously placed objects is necessary.
           
           Given that the object is square, its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) has side length *s* = 0.09372664882763859. The surface's boundaries will dictate the valid placement regions for our square object. Rotation (*theta*) of the object will affect its AABB as the object's geometry is described by its local AABB and not the local AABB itself after any rotation (the rotated AABB will contain the shape).
           
           To ensure stability and containment, the rotated AABB of the object must remain entirely within the surface's AABB.  The effective half-side length (which is the dimension of the containing AABB after rotation for a square) is calculated as `0.5 * s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This means:
           
           *   For `theta = 0`, the effective half-side length is minimized to *s*/2 = 0.046863324413819295 and the feasible region is the maximum possible. This means *x* and *y* range from -0.0881 to 0.0881.
           *   For `theta = pi/4`, the effective half-side length is maximized to *s* * sqrt(2)/2 = 0.06627573463754245, thus reducing the allowable region.
           *   For `theta = pi/2`, the effective half-side length is again *s/2* and the area is similar to when *theta* is zero (the object has the same AABB)
           
           I'll generate 50 placements as follows:
           
           1.  **Grid Placement with theta=0:** I will create a 7x7 grid of evenly spaced placements in the (x, y) plane, while *theta* stays at 0. The valid `x` and `y` range is [-0.0881, 0.0881].
           2. **Additional center point:** The 50th placement is (0.0, 0.0) with *theta* = *pi*/4.
           
           This ensures diverse placements within Surface 0, using the largest feasible placement region and utilizing a different value of *theta* for the 50th unique placement. This set of 50 placements will meet the objectives.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 5**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed Object 6 and it's fixed in the scene. I now need to find stable placements for Object 5. Object 5 is almost the same size as Object 6, but I need to position it 50 times without any collisions.
           
           Based on the known dimensions, I'll calculate the bounding box for object 5 and establish collision zones for various angles, starting with zero degrees. I'll need to define the 'forbidden zone', which is the space overlapping Object 6. For simplicity, I will begin by placing it with a theta equal to zero (0 degrees).
           
           I will start by defining a 7 x 7 grid to analyze the valid (safe) zones. However, the surface has a constraint on where I can place the item to avoid Object 6. With this knowledge, I'll filter the points. Object 5 cannot overlap Object 6's area, so I'll generate a grid and filter out any points within the restricted zone around the object. I'll need to account for both the valid placement zone, and the forbidden sub-region where a collision would occur.
           
           After making the 7 x 7 grid, I'll need to ensure that the total safe zone equals 50, otherwise, I will have to increase the grid density or add an additional angle with `theta = pi / 4` to make the count. In this case, 33 points (out of the 49) are safe.
           
           To make the required 50 points, I will add more with a rotated `theta` value of `pi / 4`. I'll also add additional density for this specific configuration to produce the total valid count.
           
           From a 5 x 5 grid, 16 points were calculated as valid, the sum will be 33 + 16 = 49 (missing one). With 5 steps in X and Y, 16 points could be made for a total of 16 for pi/4. Now I'm one point short. The 50th point has to be set, so I'll put a 8 x 8 grid to account for all placements.
           
           To solve this, I'll switch to an 8x8 grid for `theta=0`, which should be able to produce the 48 placements I need. Afterwards, I will add two more points from the pi / 4 grid to cover the 50 total safe points.
           
           This approach will ensure I get 50 different positions for Object 5 that don't collide.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object 4**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for Object 4 on Surface 0. Existing objects, Object 6 and Object 5, are already placed, and I need to avoid collisions with them. Surface 0's dimensions are fixed.
           
           My process starts by understanding the constraints: Object 4's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) must fit within the surface, and its position must not overlap with the AABBs of Object 6 or Object 5.
           
           First, I calculate the AABB of Object 4, specifically for rotations of 0 and pi/4 radians. Then I start generating placements primarily with theta = 0, using the bounds and calculating forbidden regions from the two object already placed. The placement is valid if there are no collisions.
           
           I've generated a grid of candidate placements with 10 x 10 and 12 x 12, running a collision check that determines when a newly calculated box would collides with the pre-existing objects.
           
           In the end, I was able to generate 77 stable placements with theta = 0. From these, I only need to select 50.
