           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunctive axiom requiring eight conditions to be met.  The initial state satisfies the first four conditions, leaving me to focus on: obtaining images of two objectives (`v17`, `v18`) in a specific mode (`v11`), and receiving the results of analyzing two rock samples (one stone and one soil).
           
           **Understanding the Necessary Actions and Preconditions**
           
           To get the images, I'd need to use actions to take images (`take_image`) and send them (`send_image`).  For the analyses, I'd need to use sample (`sample_rock`) and send the results (`send_analysis`). The preconditions for these actions are crucial: *imagevisible, comvisible, above, store*, and *free* conditions.  The objects provided are: two rovers (`v12`, `v14`), a lander (`v9`), a camera (`v10`), several rocks (stones and soils), and storage (`v16`).
           
           **State Analysis and Initial Observations**
           
           I see that `v10` (the camera) is onboard both rovers, and `mode(v11)` is defined.  The initial state indicates that the objects `v17` and `v18` are visible to the rovers, and both rovers are initially configured (`atconf`) and have free storage. Also, that `comvisible` to the lander and `ray` and `~blocked` are given to `v12` & `v14` for communications as well as for the images. So the lander can receive from both rovers, while each rover can also see the targets for their actions.
           
           **The Crucial Constraint: Limited Action Set**
           
           Here's the problem: I'm only allowed to use a highly restricted set of actions, *`move` and `drop_rock`*, none of which are useful for capturing or analyzing rocks.
           
           **The Inescapable Conclusion: Unreachable Goal**
           
           Given this limitation, I'm unable to use the needed `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. Therefore, the `new-axiom@0()` goal is *unreachable*. It's not possible to progress the initial state to the goal state with such severe restrictions.
