(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for Object ID 4 on Surface 0**
           
           As an expert in the field, my thought process is clear and systematic. My goal is to determine 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 4, dimensions 0.09852610537690287 x 0.09852610537690287) on a square surface (Surface 0, bounds defined by ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))).
           
           Stability requires the object's AABB to be fully contained within the surface's AABB. Since the object is square, calculations are simplified. I define `effective_size` as the projected size of the object's rotated AABB, which depends on the rotation angle (theta). To ensure a stable placement, I need to ensure that the object's center remains within a defined area within the surface, considering the effective size and the rotation.
           
           I calculated the valid ranges for the object's center coordinates (x, y) for various theta values. The formula to calculate that range involves the effective size, which depends on the rotation.
           
           I selected five representative theta values (0, PI/8, PI/4, 3PI/8, PI/2) and calculated the corresponding effective sizes and the minimum and maximum coordinates.
           
           To generate 50 stable placements, I will combine grid placement for those 5 values.
           I will use the following placements for surface 0:
           ```
           [(0, 0.0, -0.08, -0.08), (0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.0), (0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.08), (0, 0.0, -0.04, -0.08), (0, 0.0, -0.04, 0.0), (0, 0.0, -0.04, 0.08), (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.08), (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.08), (0, 0.0, 0.04, -0.08), (0, 0.0, 0.04, 0.0), (0, 0.0, 0.04, 0.08), (0, 0.0, 0.08, -0.08), (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0), (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.08), (0, 0.39269908169872414, -0.06, -0.06), (0, 0.39269908169872414, -0.06, 0.0), (0, 0.39269908169872414, -0.06, 0.06), (0, 0.39269908169872414, -0.03, -0.06), (0, 0.39269908169872414, -0.03, 0.0), (0, 0.39269908169872414, -0.03, 0.06), (0, 0.39269908169872414, 0.0, -0.06), (0, 0.39269908169872414, 0.0, 0.0), (0, 0.39269908169872414, 0.0, 0.06), (0, 0.39269908169872414, 0.03, -0.06), (0, 0.39269908169872414, 0.03, 0

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 5**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new request to place an object (ID 5) on a surface, avoiding collision with a previously placed object (ID 4). Object 4 is at `(0, 0.0, -0.08, -0.08)` and I know its dimensions.  It's critical that I do not overlap the placements, therefore the solution must avoid collisions.
           
           The key challenge is to generate a set of 50 stable placements for object 5, considering its square shape and a range of rotations (0, pi/8, pi/4, and 3pi/8 radians).
           
           Here's my thought process:
           
           1.  **Understand the Surface and Object Properties:**
               *   The surface is defined as `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
               *   Object 5 is a square with side length of approximately `0.09601`.
               *   Object 4 is also square and is placed at a specific spot.
           
           2.  **Calculate Effective Side Lengths:**
               *   For each rotation (theta), I need to calculate the *effective side length* of object 5. This will depend on the rotation. I did the math to determine the necessary bounds.
               *   For `theta = 0`, the effective side length is the actual side length (`0.09601`).
               *   For `theta = pi/4`, it's the diagonal length (`0.09601 * sqrt(2)`)
               *   At the other theta points, I get similar results.
           3.  **Define Collision Avoidance:**
               *   I need to prevent collisions. I know the position of object 4, and its bounding box.
               *   To be collision-free, no part of Object 5's bounding box can overlap with Object 4's bounding box for any rotation considered.
           4.  **Generate Placement Candidates:**
               *   To find these collision-free locations, I plan to sample points for object 5.
               *   For each rotation, I'll generate a grid of x,y coordinates covering the surface. I also account for the shape and the rotated objects bounds.
           5.  **Calculate Effective Ranges:**
               *   To avoid collisions, I need to know precisely where object 4 is placed. Thus, I calculate the `x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max` of its AABB.
               *   For each rotation, I adjust the grid points to avoid overlapping AABB's for each valid `theta`.
           6.  **Collision Filtering:**
               *   I iterate through each proposed position (x, y, theta).
               *   I calculate the bounding box for object 5 based on that position and rotation.
               *   I then determine if those placements are collision free based on overlap check of the bounding boxes, based on the `x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max` of both objects.
           
           7.  **Final Placement Selection:**
               *   I created a grid and checked all combinations.
               *   Since I need 50 safe placements, I will select these from the set of non-colliding locations. I calculated all placements and then filtered to select the 50 safe combinations.
           
           And that's it!  Now I just need to compile the coordinates, theta, and orientations.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Analyzing and Ensuring Stable Configurations**
           
           Okay, so I've got this new object, ID 6, that I need to place 50 times stably on surface 0.  My main headache is avoiding collisions with the two objects already there, ID 4 and ID 5.  Surface 0 is a square, and object 6 is also a square, albeit a smaller one.  The math is straightforward:  I'm dealing with squares, so I need to check for AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) overlaps.  
           
           First, I simplified the problem. I'm going to start by assuming object 6 is at a rotation of zero (theta=0). It's the best way to maximize the space I can place and simplify collision checks.
           
           My game plan is this:
           
           1.  **Check Surface Containment:** Make sure my object's center point, `(cx, cy)`, is within the bounds of the square surface. This gives me my valid placement ranges for `cx` and `cy`.
           2.  **Avoid Collisions with Existing Objects:**  I've calculated the AABBs for object 4 and 5.  I need to ensure that the AABB of object 6 does not intersect with either of these.  This boils down to a few inequalities - checking if my object's bounds exceed the others bounds.
           3.  **Refine Placement:** I'll set a grid to test positions, calculating the AABBs to determine if each is a valid position.
           
           For step 2, I need to check for non-overlap for x and y of object 6 with those of object 4, and do the same for object 5. My equations will give valid placement ranges for x and y. If the equations hold, it's a non-overlap and is valid.
           
           For the initial set, `theta = 0`, I found I needed `cx` to be at least `0.018` for it not to overlap with object 4, while I also needed object 6 `cx >= 0.01675` or  `cy <= -0.07674` in order to not collide with object 5. Combining the terms, `cx >= 0.018` to avoid either.
           I then found it was best to add a finer grid to add up to 50 locations using `0.01`. So I did so.
           
           Now, if I need more positions, I'll need to consider other angles. For `pi/4`, my analysis gets a bit trickier, as I will have a rotated object.
           
           I've got the 50 positions by using a finer grid. These locations are valid, and stable, and they'll get me the required placements.
