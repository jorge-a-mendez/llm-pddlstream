User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.076, -0.527), (0.022, -0.428)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.207, 0.274, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.836, 0.549).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.253, 0.228), (-0.161, 0.32)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.221, -0.375, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.952, 0.306).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.172, -0.424), (0.27, -0.326)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.027, -0.477, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.901, -0.434).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom stackable(v14, v10)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom atpose(v14, v15)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom stackable(v14, v16)
           Atom supported(v14, v15, v11)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable Due to Action Instance Constraints**
           
           Okay, so the task is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`.  Easy enough, in principle.  We need to reason about *how* to do that, and the initial state gives us a hint: all three objects are currently supported by `v11`.  Therefore, to get them onto `v16`, we'd need to manipulate them – *pick* them up, and *place* them on the target.  Simple.
           
           But, the problem throws a wrench in the works: I'm restricted to using *only* the action instances provided.  I can't just cook up any plan I like.  The only action instance I'm given is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  That's... well, that's moving the base from `v3` to `v3`.  In other words, doing *nothing*.
           
           The problem explicitly states that any action *not* in the list *cannot* be used.  And there's no `pick` or `place` in sight.  This is a critical constraint!
           
           Let's break down the problem further.  To get `on(v8, v16)`, for example, I'd need to find a suitable pose, `p_new`, such that `supported(v8, p_new, v16)` and `atpose(v8, p_new)` are true. Currently, `v8` is `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`.  To change this, *I need a mechanism to pick v8 from v9 and place it at p_new*.  
           
           But I can't.  The *only* action I have is `move_base`. This is a dead end.
           
           I've carefully reread the instructions, and it's crystal clear.  The available actions are *limited* to what's provided.  Since the necessary `pick` and `place` actions aren't in that list, the goal is *unachievable* given the constraints.  I have to explain that.
