User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.253, 0.228), (-0.161, 0.32)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.172, -0.424), (0.27, -0.326)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.076, -0.527), (0.022, -0.428)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.207, 0.274, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.836, 0.549).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.221, -0.375, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.952, 0.306).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.027, -0.477, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.901, -0.434).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Objects on Surface v16**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan: I need to get objects v8, v12, and v14 all *on* surface v16.  Currently, they're sitting pretty on surface v11.  The key to making this happen is understanding the "on" predicate. It's pretty straightforward: for something to be "on" another thing, it just needs to be supported by it and at a valid pose.
           
           Now, the initial state shows us the current support structure: v8, v12, and v14 are *all* supported by v11.  My goal is to shift them to v16.  The given predicates support the fact that the robot's current pose is safe, and it's base has a specific configuration `v3` which is also valid for the plan.
           
           My strategy?  Simple: pick, move, place.  Pick each object, move it to the correct spot on v16, and then place it there. This involves utilizing a robot with an arm `v4`, assuming v3 will be the only safe base configuration given the lack of valid kinematic moves.
           
           The trickier part is the placement.  I'm using the continuous pose `#o2` for all three objects. The instructions I was given mean I need to provide *unique* values for the pose of each object (even though they share the same symbol). I have to define those poses to avoid any collisions.
           
           To make this work, I'm going to position v8, v12, and v14 in a way that minimizes the chance of a collision.  I calculated that their AABBs (bounding boxes) are roughly 10cm x 10cm, v16 is 27cm x 27cm.  I'm going to place `v8` to the left, `v12` to the right of `v8`, and then v14 at the bottom. This means v12 won't be in the way of v14, and there are no overlaps. The height is set at 0.781 (z coordinate) where all the initial poses have this z-value. The orientation is zero.
           Here's my plan, in order:
           
           --Plan--:
           1.  Pick v8 from its current pose (v9), using hand #o1, with configuration v3, and the arm trajectory #o4.
           2.  Place v8 at pose #o2, using hand #o1, with configuration v3, and the arm trajectory #o4.
           3.  Pick v12 from its current pose (v13), using hand #o1, with configuration v3, and the arm trajectory #o4.
           4.  Place v12 at pose #o2, using hand #o1, with configuration v3, and the arm trajectory #o4.
           5.  Pick v14 from its current pose (v15), using hand #o1, with configuration v3, and the arm trajectory #o4.
           6.  Place v14 at pose #o2, using hand #o1, with configuration v3, and the arm trajectory #o4.
           
           --Poses--:
           For the `#o2` continuous parameters, the following are the *unique* geometric placement:
           -   `#o2 v8 v16: (-0.08 0.08 0.781 0.0)`
           -   `#o2 v12 v16: (0.08 0.08 0.781 0.0)`
           -   `#o2 v14 v16: (0.0 -0.08 0.781 0.0)`
           
           I know that all pre-conditions are met and should produce the intended result.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Plan Impossibility**
           
           Okay, so the user has correctly pointed out a critical flaw in the previous plan: the only allowed action is `move_base`.  This means no picking up or placing down objects – basically, no manipulation actions.  This is a big problem.
           
           The target goal is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` *on* `v16`.  To be "on" something, two things have to be true: first, the object has to be supported by the target surface (which we have; `supported(v12, #o2, v16)`, etc.).  Second, the object must *be at* a pose on that surface (`atpose(v8, #o2)`, etc.).
           
           The initial state tells us where the objects *actually* are: `atpose(v12, v13)`, `atpose(v8, v9)`, and `atpose(v14, v15)`.  And critically, they're all "supported" on *v11*, not *v16*.
           
           To get them onto `v16`, we'd need to change their `atpose` predicates.  Logically, to achieve `on(v8, v16)` we need to move `v8` from its current pose (`v9`) to the pose on `v16` (`#o2`). This means we need to *change* the `atpose` predicate.
           
           But, and here's the kicker, the only way to modify `atpose` is through `pick` and `place` actions, or implicitly through pick as negation. And we can't use `pick` and `place`!  We're stuck with `move_base`.
           
           Therefore, the target goals are completely unreachable.  We're dealing with an unsolvable constraint problem, given the allowed action set. The planning problem is impossible.
