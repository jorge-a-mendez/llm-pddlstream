           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.253, 0.228), (-0.161, 0.32)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.172, -0.424), (0.27, -0.326)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.076, -0.527), (0.022, -0.428)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.207, 0.274, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.836, 0.549).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.221, -0.375, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.952, 0.306).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.027, -0.477, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.901, -0.434).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've devised:**
           
           My primary goal is to place three objects (v8, v12, and v14) onto a specific surface, v16.  Currently, these objects are resting on another surface, v11.  The robot arm (v4) is initially empty and positioned at a known configuration.
           
           The plan will proceed in a straightforward manner: I'll pick up each object individually from v11 and place it onto v16. The specific actions involve using the available pick and place actions, and the plan uses the *same* `pose #o2` for placement. All three objects are to be placed at the location `#o2` with coordinate values I will provide, one value for each object.
           
           To optimize the process, I need to consider a few key details.  First, before picking up any object, the robot's base (v3) might need to move to a different base configuration,  #o3.  Given that #o3's configuration may be different from the starting configuration, I'll start with a move base step. Since only one move base is necessary and it's cheapest before picking/placing, it is best before the pickup of v8.
           
           Second, I've confirmed that the given AABBs for the objects are in the world coordinates when the objects are at their original poses. I need to make sure the poses for the placed objects are distinct to avoid collisions.  Because the objects need to be placed on a small surface, I will choose 3 distinct locations on the surface, each far enough away from the others. These will be the placements on #o2.  In this way the placed objects will not collide with each other.
           
           Therefore, the detailed plan is:
           1.  Move base: Move the robot's base from its current configuration, v3, to a new base configuration, #o3.
           2.  Pick v8: Pick up object v8 from its current pose.
           3.  Place v8: Place object v8 onto the target surface at a specific, calculated location using the pose,  #o2.
           4.  Pick v12: Pick up object v12 from its current pose.
           5.  Place v12: Place object v12 onto the target surface at the specific and calculated location using the pose,  #o2.
           6.  Pick v14: Pick up object v14 from its current pose.
           7.  Place v14: Place object v14 onto the target surface at the specific and calculated location using the pose,  #o2.
           
           The key to this plan's success hinges on accurately defining the `#o2` values for each object, making sure they are non-colliding and valid placement locations on v16. The values for #o2 are:
           - `(-0.05, -0.05, 0.781, 0.0)` for v8
           - `(0.05, 0.05, 0.781, 0.0)` for v12
           - `(-0.05, 0.05, 0.781, 0.0)` for v14
           
           The total estimated cost is the distance to move the base + 6 (the number of pick and place actions). This cost accounts for the base move and the pick-and-place actions for each object. The plan should meet the goal with an optimal cost.
