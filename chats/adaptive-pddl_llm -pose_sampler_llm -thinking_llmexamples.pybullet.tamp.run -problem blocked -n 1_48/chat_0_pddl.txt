           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's break down this placement problem. I'm tasked with finding 50 stable positions for a small square object on a rectangular surface.**
           
           First things first: the object is a 0.07 x 0.07 square, and the surface spans from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0).  Since the object is square, its rotated AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) will have the same dimensions, so I don't have to worry about the rotation affecting its footprint too much. I'll need to define each placement as `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`.
           
           My initial thought is that since the object is small relative to the surface (0.07 vs 0.6 in each dimension), I have a lot of flexibility. I'll need to ensure the object's AABB fits within the surface's AABB after any rotation. I calculated the AABB half-extents, `hx` and `hy`, and the rotated AABB dimensions as well.  Since the object is a square, the AABB doesn't change by the same magnitude as the object's rotation (just by `sqrt(2)` for the maximum at `pi/4`).
           
           Given the object is small, I can pretty much choose any orientation, theta. For simplicity, and because it makes sense given the task, I will set `surf_idx` to 0 for all placements, which is the index for the given surface.
           
           Now, to generate the 50 placements. I'll start by generating 25 placements with `theta = 0`.  This means the object is aligned with the surface axes.
           
           For the x-coordinate, I'll keep the range between [4.235, 4.765].
           For the y-coordinate, the range will be [-0.565, -0.035].
           
           Then, I'll generate the next 25 with `theta = pi/4`. In this orientation the object's AABB will be rotated by 45 degrees. The valid x-coordinates center range will then be [4.2495, 4.7505], which is very similar. The y-coordinates will change to [-0.5505, -0.0495].
           
           I'll pick 5 x-values and 5 y-values for each set to form a 5x5 grid, so 25 placements in total for each `theta` value.  This way, I'll be distributing the object positions evenly across the surface. This guarantees no collisions between placements, and they are all within the bounds. This will give me a diverse set of placements.
           
           Finally, I'll create the 50 placements as required.
