           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Goal and Constraints**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to needing an object of a certain `type` to be `on` a specific object. Looking at the initial state, I see two objects that fit the `type` requirement.  My initial instinct is to move one of them onto the target object using `pick` and `place` actions.
           
           However, here's where it gets tricky. I'm given a very specific list of *allowed* action instances, and it *only* contains a single `move_base` action that essentially does nothing.  This is a huge red flag because I can't find any way to execute `pick` or `place` if those actions aren't listed! The only way to achieve the `on` predicate is via supported and atpose, which means I have to move an object to a different pose.
           
           So, I start thinking I can use `pick` and `place` on v8 because `supported` is true and `atpose` is also true. But, the action instances given, I can't use `pick` and `place`.
           
           **The Unsolvable Puzzle**
           
           I'm forced to re-examine the problem, I dig into the initial state, carefully evaluating each fact and axiom. I quickly realize that I can't achieve this state without being able to pick and place. There's no existing way to satisfy the `on` predicate from the initial state or any of the current axioms. I check if there is some other way to satisfy the axioms that I'm missing, but I can't see how.
           
           Then, I double and triple-check the explicit constraint: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." And that's the kicker! I'm completely hamstrung by this rule. I'm *only* allowed the no-op `move_base` action, which doesn't alter any of the positions or `atpose` facts.
           
           **The Inevitable Conclusion**
           
           Given the severe limitation on action instances, I'm left with no possible plan to achieve the goal.  It's simply unsolvable within the defined constraints. I double-checked the preconditions to the `pick` and `place`, and it's clear the base configuration must be the same as the current base configuration. The `move_base` makes `canmove` false which is also an issue, even if it could be used.  It's a frustrating situation because the problem setup *looks* like it should be solvable, but the action constraint makes it impossible.  I'm forced to conclude the goal is unreachable.
