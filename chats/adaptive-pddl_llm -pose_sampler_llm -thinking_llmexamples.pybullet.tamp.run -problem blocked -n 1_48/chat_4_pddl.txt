           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Okay, let's break down this planning problem.** My goal is to achieve `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a certain `type` placed "on" a specific target location.  I've got a detailed initial state and a bunch of available actions to work with.
           
           First, I identified the object candidates – both `v8` and `v12` fit the required `type`. Looking at their locations, I determined that both could be potentially moved onto the target location, `v18`.  Since both are viable, and I need to start somewhere, I chose to work on moving `v8`.
           
           The current pose of `v8` is `atpose(v8, v9)` and it's currently "on" `v11`. The goal pose is at `#p0` on `v18`.  To achieve this, I broke it down to a "pick" action, a "place" action, and two required base movements.  I needed to account for the fact that the robot arm (represented by `v4`) needs to be `handempty` and the base needs to be configured correctly for both the pick and the place.
           
           I examined the available "pick" and "place" actions. To execute them, I need to first position the robot's base using `move_base`. So my plan is to first get the base from its current configuration `v3` to configuration `#q0`, which is required by the `pick` action. After that, I would then have the arm pick the object, then move the base to configuration `#q1`, which is required by the `place` action, and then the arm would place the object at its target location. I needed to carefully check the preconditions, making sure each step sets up what the next step needs.
           
           I validated each action's preconditions, ensuring they were met by either the initial state or the effects of the preceding action. This also means I had to make sure the robot can't move between all actions because pick and place both affect the ability for the robot to move, which means base movement is necessary.
           
           I then double-checked that the robot and the objects aren't subject to any collisions. Given the available trajectories, that doesn't seem to be a problem based on the state. It seems safe.
           
           After the sequence, `on(v8, v18)` would be satisfied. This, combined with the fact that its type is also in the initial state, confirms that I have successfully satisfied the goal. The plan is valid because I showed that the preconditions of all available actions are satisfied.
           
           Essentially, I am confident that the plan (`move_base`, `pick`, `move_base`, `place`) is valid, minimal and will achieve the desired goal.
