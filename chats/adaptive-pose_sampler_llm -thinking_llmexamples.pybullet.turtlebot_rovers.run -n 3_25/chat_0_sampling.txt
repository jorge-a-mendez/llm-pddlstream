(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, so I've got this target point, and I need to place three robot bases near it. The catch is, they need to be within a 2-unit radius of the target, *avoid collisions with obstacles*, and have a clear line of sight.  Essentially, I'm playing spatial Tetris with the given map.
           
           My thought process is this: First, I'm going to quickly analyze the map, focusing on the obstacles to get a clear picture of the play area and potential trouble spots. This looks like a rectangle with slightly inward-facing walls, a vertical wall down the middle, and scattered boxes. The central wall really splits the field in half, so I know where the target is will influence my base placements. I'm focusing on providing diversity, so I will prioritize positions on the same side of the center wall as the target.
           
           I need to make sure I don't go outside the bounds, and that I'm considering line of sight and the central wall at x=0. So, I will be thinking "is this location viable?" The position can't be too near any of the walls. It needs to have space for the robot to move around.
           
           I'm thinking of this in terms of valid x, y coordinate ranges, and then I'm making sure my candidate points are outside of the AABBs. My target is at (0.575, -0.7). I'll calculate distances and check if there are any obstacles nearby.
           
           My plan is to put three points around the target, avoiding the x=0 wall. I will make sure the base points are on the right side of that, considering that the target is also on the right.
           
           So, here are my chosen base positions, all within the 2-unit range and seemingly unobstructed:
           
           1.  **Right:** `(2.075, -0.7)` - Straight out to the right 1.5 units away. This offers a clear view.
           2.  **Bottom-Left:** `(0.1, -1.0)` - Slightly on the left of the target, this position provides a different angle, and is still on the correct side of the center.
           3.  **Above-Right:** `(1.845, 0.57)` - Offers another angle to the upper-right of the target.
           
           I think these positions are good. They're diverse, they avoid potential collisions based on the given AABB information, and they're within the valid placement area. I've double-checked those.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Problem: Target Point and Line-of-Sight**
           
           Okay, here's what I've got. The user's feedback pointed out a critical error: I was using the wrong target point for my analysis. The correct target point is `(-0.39659446477890015, 2.135388135910034)`. I'll refer to this as `T = (-0.397, 2.135)` for simplicity. My previous attempts failed due to incorrect assumptions and, more importantly, the wrong target.
           
           The feedback mentioned specific positions I proposed and the reasons for their failure. It's important to learn from these. I had to focus on the key lessons. My first big mistake was not having the right target.
           
           The other positions, (0.1, -1.0), (1.845, 0.57), and (2.075, -0.7) all failed line-of-sight tests. But also, (0.1, -1.0) directly collided with wall 0, which also informed my choices of the left-hand side.
           
           Now, analyzing the feedback with the correct target point, I've identified a major obstacle: the target point `T` is *inside* a small object identified as obstacle 10, and also is contained by obstacle 19.
           
           This is a problem! A target point cannot be inside a static obstacle. Or at least, I am working under the assumption that it can't.
           
           If this is indeed how the simulation is set up, this means any "line of sight" to T must pass through 10 and 19. If they are solid, line of sight is impossible. However, the problem statement says "never give up", so there has to be a way, likely by taking a path through the obstacles.
           
           My main constraint is that my robot base must be within 2 units of the target.
           Here, I'm making the strong assumption that the program's "line-of-sight" test is designed to work *through* those obstacles in a limited capacity when the target is inside them, allowing it in this case.
           
           I have to carefully evaluate locations, so I have come up with a strategy.
           
           My strategy needs to include:
           
           1.  Keeping my base to the left of wall 0.
           2.  My goal is to keep my base within range of the target, avoiding any contact.
           
           To this end, these are my three positions:
           
           *   **Position 1: (-1.397, 0.635)** This is to the bottom-left and should clear the various obstacles in the region.
           *   **Position 2: (-1.740, 0.792)** This is another attempt, closer to the left, which should also clear the obstacles and give me a unique angle for line of sight.
           *   **Position 3: (-0.897, 1.635)** I'm thinking about being closer to T, as it is in a hard to view position, and might increase my odds of success.
           
           I'm now sending these to the user to test, along with this full explanation of my reasoning.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning for Position Proposals**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of my thought process for the current request. First, I needed to get the target point straight. It looks like the system uses the placeholder `{target_point}` for *my* side, but the feedback uses the actual target point. So, the *real* target for this round is `T = (-1.9423242807388306, 2.1794705390930176)`. This is key!
           
           I learned from the previous feedback that:
           
           1.  The central wall (`obstacle 0`) is an absolute no-go. Must stay to the left (`x < -0.05`).
           2.  "Not reachable" usually means collision or a path block, even if my collision checks aren't perfect. I need to be *very* cautious.
           3.  Targets inside obstacles are usually okay for line of sight to go through.
           4.  I should not propose similar positions again if the previous one failed for path reasons.
           
           The target `T` is near `8: ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25))` and `21: ((-1.990, 2.130), (-1.893, 2.228))`. These obstacles *contain* the target, but I still need to avoid colliding with them.
           
           Given these constraints, I carefully considered these positions:
           
           *   **P1 (-2.4, 2.179):** Placed directly left of the target to avoid obstacles, checking it's outside `8`, `21`, and that x isn't too close to the environment boundary on the left, `-2.45`.
           *   **P2 (-1.942, 0.679):** Below the target in the -y direction to avoid the obstacle cluster. I needed to confirm it was not inside and it was safe.
           *   **P3 (-2.4, 0.679):** To further move the base to a safer area, outside obstacles to have a good line of sight.
           
           In summary, I am carefully placing the robot base outside known obstacles, avoiding previously flagged areas, and considering that the boundary for the valid positions is `-2.45`. I hope these positions work this time!
