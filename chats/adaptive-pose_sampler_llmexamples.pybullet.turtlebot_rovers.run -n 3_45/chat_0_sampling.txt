User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with inner dimensions 5x5, centered at the origin. There is a thin wall through the middle of the room along the y-axis (x=0). There are also smaller obstacles in various locations within the room. I need to find positions that are within 2 units of the target point (-0.9570146903207047 0.9416599727402846) and do not collide with any obstacles or cause occlusions. I will try to place the robot in open areas, avoiding the known obstacles and the central wall.
           
           Target point: (-0.9570146903207047 0.9416599727402846)
           
           The target point is in the top-left quadrant, near the central wall (x=0) and one of the smaller obstacles (obstacle 16: ((-0.3188124998104493, 0.2934824721324523), (-0.17913650436282952, 0.4331584675800721))). I will try to place the robot to the left and slightly below the target, or slightly above the target.
           
           Positions:
           (-1.5 0.5)
           (-1.0 2.0)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     I apologize for the previous invalid positions. The target point in the previous request was (1.9846855401992798, 1.9205090999603271), which is in the top-right quadrant. My previous proposed positions were in the top-left quadrant, so it is understandable why there was no line of sight due to the central wall (obstacle 5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))). I will take this into account for the new request.
           
           New target point: (-0.9570146903207047 0.9416599727402846). This target is in the top-left quadrant, as in my initial analysis. I need to find positions that are within 2 units of this target point. I need to avoid the central wall and the small obstacles near the target point. Obstacle 16 ((-0.3188124998104493, 0.2934824721324523), (-0.17913650436282952, 0.4331584675800721)) is close to the target. Obstacles 8, 9, 10 are also in the top left quadrant.
           
           I will try positions that are further away from the central wall and other obstacles.

Model:     My sincere apologies for the continued failures. It appears I'm making a mistake in interpreting the target point and also the obstacles. I need to be more precise.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the target points and the failures carefully.
           
           **Previous Failures Analysis:**
           *   **Target point:** (1.9846855401992798, 1.9205090999603271) - This is in the top-right quadrant. My initial positions (-1.5, 0.5), (-1.0, 2.0), (-2.0, 1.0) were in the top-left quadrant and correctly failed due to the central wall (obstacle 5). This confirms the central wall is a significant obstacle.
           *   **Target point:** (-1.9065494537353516, 1.9208738803863525) - This is in the top-left quadrant, very close to the wall and several obstacles (8, 20).
               *   Proposed position: (-1.5, 1.5) - "no line of sight to target". This position is relatively close to the target, but there might be a small obstacle in between, or a corner occlusion. Obstacle 20 ((-1.9545808611969595, 1.8728424729247446), (-1.8585180462737436, 1.9689052878479605)) is extremely close to this target point, and could be causing the occlusion.
               *   Proposed position: (-0.5, 0.5) - "no line of sight to target". This position is in the top-left, but quite far from the target. It's likely occluded by other obstacles, possibly obstacle 10 ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)) or the central wall if the line of sight crosses near x=0.
               *   Proposed position: (-2.0, 0.0) - "not reachable for robot base". This likely means it's outside the x/y limits or collided with a fixed obstacle. Checking the obstacles: there's nothing obvious at (-2.0, 0.0) that would be unreachable, except maybe near the corner obstacle 6, which ends at y=-1.6. It could be a collision with the left wall (obstacle 4) or just considered "not reachable" if it's too close to an edge or other geometry. This is strange, as (-2.0, 0.0) is within the [-2.5, 2.5] bounds. Perhaps there's an unseen obstacle or complex geometry.
           
           **New Target Point:** (-0.9570146903207047 0.9416599727402846)
           
           This target is in the top-left quadrant. It's to the left of the central wall, and below obstacles 8, 9, 10, and 16. Specifically, obstacle 16 ((-0.3188124998104493, 0.2934824721324523), (-0.17913650436282952, 0.4331584675800721)) is directly to the right and slightly below the target, which could cause occlusions if the robot is placed too far to the left. The target is also close to obstacle 11, 13, 14, 17.
           
           I need to pick positions within 2 units of the target (-0.957, 0.941).
           
           To ensure line of sight, I should try to place the robot in open areas, directly looking at the target. Given the target is at x=-0.957, y=0.941, I will try to find positions nearby.
           
           Let's try:
           1.  **Above the target:** (-0.957, 1.5). This is within 2 units. It should have a clear view down to the target.
           2.  **To the left of the target:** (-1.5, 0.941). This should also have a clear view.
           3.  **Below the target, but avoiding obstacle 16:** (-0.957, 0.2). This is also within 2 units.
           
           Positions:
           (-0.957 1.5)
           (-1.5 0.941)
           (-0.957 0.2)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           ```
           
           The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     It appears I'm still misinterpreting the target point from the feedback. The feedback for previous requests always refers to specific target points from those requests, but the new request provides a *new* target point. I need to focus on the most recent *provided* target point for the new request, which is (-0.9570146903207047 0.9416599727402846).
           
           Let's re-examine the target and potential obstacles:
           Target point: (-0.9570146903207047 0.9416599727402846)
           
           Nearby obstacles:
           *   Obstacle 16: ((-0.3188124998104493, 0.2934824721324523), (-0.17913650436282952, 0.4331584675800721)) - This is to the right and below the target.
           *   Obstacle 14: ((0.15026209983052397, 0.854798671929256), (0.2621666070538602, 0.9667031791525922)) - This is further to the right of the target.
           *   Obstacle 11: ((0.8354538482138522, 0.9339419406363375), (0.9768480259469144, 1.0753361183693997)) - Even further right.
           *   Obstacle 17: ((0.34821872891881656, 0.4595545131156702), (0.47637737808725644, 0.5877131622841101)) - To the right and below.
           *   The central wall (obstacle 5) is at x=0.0.
           
           The target is at x ~ -0.95, y ~ 0.94.
           The previous proposed positions for this target (not the ones in the failure list from the *previous* *request* which was for a *different* target) were:
           (-0.957 1.5) - This is almost directly above the target.
           (-1.5 0.941) - This is almost directly to the left of the target.
           (-0.957 0.2) - This is almost directly below the target.
           
           Since none of these failed *for this specific target*, I will re-propose them as they are likely valid. The failure list provided in the prompt is for *different target points*. My previous explanation was based on the *current target point* but the system provided failures for a *different one*. This can be confusing. I must focus on the current target point.
           
           Given the target (-0.9570146903207047 0.9416599727402846), the positions I previously proposed were within max_range 2. I will reuse them because they are geometrically sensible for *this* target point and haven't been explicitly failed *for this target point*.
           
           Positions:
           (-0.957 1.5)
           (-1.5 0.941)
           (-0.957 0.2)
