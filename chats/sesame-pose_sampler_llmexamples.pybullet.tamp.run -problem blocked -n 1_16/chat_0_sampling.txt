           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 5) -- 0.07000000000000028, 0.06999999999999995)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single surface, surface 0, which is an AABB defined by the points ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)). The object is a square with dimensions 0.07 x 0.07. I need to find 50 stable placements for this object on the given surface. Since the object is square, its orientation (theta) does not affect its bounding box, but I will still vary it.
           
           I will iterate through the surface and place the object at various x and y coordinates within the bounds of the surface, ensuring that the object is fully contained. The center of the object will be placed such that `lower_x + size_x/2 <= center_x <= upper_x - size_x/2` and `lower_y + size_y/2 <= center_y <= upper_y - size_y/2`.
           
           For surface 0:
           lower_x = 4.2, lower_y = -0.6
           upper_x = 4.8, upper_y = 0.0
           Object size_x = 0.07, size_y = 0.07
           
           Valid x range for object center:
           4.2 + 0.07/2 = 4.235
           4.8 - 0.07/2 = 4.765
           So, 4.235 <= center_x <= 4.765
           
           Valid y range for object center:
           -0.6 + 0.07/2 = -0.565
           0.0 - 0.07/2 = -0.035
           So, -0.565 <= center_y <= -0.035
           
           I will generate placements by incrementing x and y within these ranges, and vary theta.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     My previous placements for object ID 5 at x=4.235 with varying rotations failed because the rotated bounding box extended beyond the surface boundary at lower_x = 4.2. This indicates that while the center of the object (x=4.235) was valid for an unrotated square, the rotation effectively increases the object's footprint. The successful placements were all at x=4.275, which is further from the edge.
           
           For this new request, I have a new object with ID 10. It is also a square, with dimensions 0.087 x 0.087. The surface is the same (surface 0: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))).
           
           I need to calculate the new valid ranges for the object's center.
           Object size_x = 0.08702255925425639, size_y = 0.08702255925425562.
           For a rotated square, the maximum extent will occur at 45 degrees, where the effective side length is `sqrt(size_x^2 + size_y^2)`. Since the previous attempts failed, I need to be more careful with placements near the edges when rotations are involved, even though the problem statement says "the geometry of the object will be described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)". The previous failures show that the *rotated* AABB is what matters for stability.
           
           Let's assume the given size_x and size_y are for the unrotated object's AABB.
           Valid x range for object center (unrotated):
           4.2 + 0.08702255925425639/2 = 4.243511279627128
           4.8 - 0.08702255925425639/2 = 4.756488720372872
           So, 4.243511279627128 <= center_x <= 4.756488720372872
           
           Valid y range for object center (unrotated):
           -0.6 + 0.08702255925425562/2 = -0.5564887203728722
           0.0 - 0.08702255925425562/2 = -0.04351127962712214
           So, -0.5564887203728722 <= center_y <= -0.04351127962712214
           
           Considering the previous failures where even small rotations caused instability near the edge x=4.2, I will ensure that the object's full rotated AABB is contained. For a square, the maximum dimension when rotated is along its diagonal. If the object's side is `s`, its diagonal is `s * sqrt(2)`. The half-diagonal is `s * sqrt(2) / 2`. This will be the maximum half-width/height when rotated.
           For ID 10, `s = 0.08702255925425639`.
           Half-diagonal = `0.08702255925425639 * sqrt(2) / 2 = 0.06153696803730784`.
           
           So, for maximum stability with rotation, the object center should be at least `0.06153696803730784` from each edge.
           New x range for object center (considering worst-case rotation):
           4.2 + 0.06153696803730784 = 4.2615369680373075
           4.8 - 0.06153696803730784 = 4.738463031962692
           So, 4.2615369680373075 <= center_x <= 4.738463031962692
           
           New y range for object center (considering worst-case rotation):
           -0.6 + 0.06153696803730784 = -0.5384630319626922
           0.0 - 0.06153696803730784 = -0.06153696803730784
           So, -0.5384630319626922 <= center_y <= -0.06153696803730784
           
           I will use these more conservative ranges to generate placements, especially for the x-coordinate. I will start slightly in from the lower x-bound, for example at x = 4.27.
