User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is enclosed by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a central vertical wall at x = 0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered around the scene, including some along the y = 2.0 and y = -2.0 lines, and some smaller boxes in various locations.
           
           I'll aim to place the robot within a circle of radius 2 centered at the target point, avoiding known obstacles. I'll prioritize positions that are relatively far from the walls and other fixed obstacles. I'll also try to vary the angle around the target point to provide a diverse set of options.
           
           Target point: (1.5 0.5)
           Positions:
           (0.5 0.5)
           (1.5 -1.5)
           (2.5 0.5)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The previous attempts for target point (1.5 0.5) show that (0.5 0.5) and (1.5 -1.5) did not have line of sight, and (2.5 0.5) collided with the right wall. This means there's likely an obstacle between the proposed positions and the target. The central wall at x=0 might be occluding the view for (0.5 0.5) if the target was on the other side, but for (1.5 0.5) it's on the same side, so this suggests other smaller obstacles might be in the way.
           
           For the new request with target point (-1.8584415912628174, 1.9655749797821045), I'll focus on the area to the left of the x=0 wall, as the target is at x ~ -1.8. The previous failed positions indicate that placing the robot in the right half of the map for a target on the left half will likely lead to occlusion by the central x=0 wall. I will also make sure to not collide with the boundary walls.
