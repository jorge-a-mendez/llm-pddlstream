           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Analysis and Unreachability**
           
           I've been tasked with formulating a plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain. After dissecting the goal, I focused on two core sets of subgoals: obtaining and sending images of four objectives, and analyzing a stone and a soil sample, ultimately receiving their analyses.
           
           My initial thought was to use existing facts in the initial state. The conditions concerning rover configurations and "free" states are already satisfied. The problem then centered on the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           
           For the images, I would need to leverage `take_image` followed by `send_image`. The supporting action, `calibrate`, would need to be executed before each image to meet `haveimage` pre-conditions. I determined that the `take_image` action consumes the effect `calibrated(?c, ?v)`, thus necessitating a calibration step before *every* image capture, a standard practice in this domain. Given the visibility predicates and equipment, the image capture-transmission process seemed straightforward, and I could use any of the rovers, v12 or v14, for these tasks.
           
           The analysis part required a deeper analysis of the domain's constraints. I identified stone and soil samples to be analyzed (v3 and v7, respectively). To achieve `receivedanalysis`, I needed the `send_analysis` action, which relies on `analyzed` and com-visibility. `analyzed` necessitates the `sample_rock` action.
           
           This is where the problem hits a dead end.
           
           I carefully considered the preconditions for `sample_rock`, specifically `atconf(?v, ?q)`, meaning the rover needs to be in a specific configuration to sample a rock in front of it. While the `above` facts indicated necessary configurations (#o5), the only available move actions were mere no-ops: they kept the rovers at their initial configurations. No actions allow either rover to move to configuration #o5. The absence of movement actions leading to the needed sample location invalidates the whole analysis part of my plan, rendering the `sample_rock`, `analyzed`, and `receivedanalysis` steps unreachable.
           
           With the given rules, `receivedanalysis` is unobtainable. Since `new-axiom@0()` requires it, the goal is thus provably *unreachable*. I confirmed that no action other than those in the provided list can be used. No path to move rovers to sampling locations exists. Therefore, I can confidently declare the goal unsolvable given the constraints.
