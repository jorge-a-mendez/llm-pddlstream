User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object

           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.316, -0.087), (-4.217, 0.012)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.266, -0.037, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.406, 0.914).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Path to New Knowledge**
           
           My primary objective is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which necessitates that an object of type `v17` be placed on object `v18`. After examining the initial state, I've identified that both `v8` and `v12` fulfill the `type v17` criteria. However, neither are initially `on v18`.
           
           My analysis suggests a simple plan: pick one of the suitable objects (`v12` or `v8`) from its initial pose and place it at a suitable position on `v18`.
           
           I'll proceed with choosing `v12`. I need a plan that achieves `on(v12, v18)` and already know that `type(v12, v17)` is satisfied.
           
           To make `on(v12, v18)` true, the object must be `supported` by `v18` at some specific pose, let's call it `#o2`. Fortunately, the initial state includes the fact that `v12` is `supported` by `#o2` on `v18`. Therefore, the plan involves picking `v12` and placing it at `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           To carry out this plan, I'll use the available robot arm `v4`. It is handempty.
           
           The plan steps are:
           1.  **Pick** `v12` from its current pose `v13`.
           2.  **Place** `v12` at the specified pose `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           The actions are supported because the relevant `kin`ematic relations are initially true in the state. I am assuming that the `move_base` action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` doesn't require us to compute any base motion, that is, the starting and the goal base configurations are equal to the initial configuration.
           
           Regarding the placement of `#o2`, I need to determine an appropriate continuous value. Based on the AABB of objects and their initial pose, I'll place the object stably with its center on `(4.5, -0.3)` with a rotation of `0.0` and at a z value of `0.8` such that it is stably placed on top of `v18`.
           
           Therefore, my final continuous variable will be `#o2: (4.5 -0.3 0.8 0.0)`.
           
           The plan cost would be 2 (one cost for pick and one for place) and achieves the axiom goal.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Problem: An Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I was given a plan, but it got rejected. The issue is clear: my initial plan used `pick` and `place` actions, and the system only considers `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))` as a valid action instance.  This presents a problem.
           
           The target state is to have a specific type of object, which I'll call `v12`, *on* another object, `v18`.  Right now, `v12` is *on* `v14` in the initial state, and it's already the right type. The only obstacle is to move it to v18.
           
           Here's the problem: I'm essentially stuck with just a `move_base` command. I can only move the robot's base. The other actions in the domain, like picking up or placing an object, are available, but I have *no* specific valid action instances of them.  That means I can't interact with any of the objects at all. I can't move `v12` from where it is to where it needs to be.
           
           Since I can't manipulate the object, the final goal, `on(v12, v18)`, is fundamentally unreachable with the actions I'm allowed to use. It’s a dead end, a paradox. The goal is simply impossible to accomplish within the given constraints.
