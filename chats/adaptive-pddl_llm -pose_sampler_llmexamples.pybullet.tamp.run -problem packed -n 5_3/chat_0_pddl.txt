           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single square surface centered at the origin. The object is also square, with side length 0.0796. Since the object is square, its orientation (rotation) does not affect its footprint. I will try to place the object in various positions on the surface, making sure it is fully contained. The surface extends from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. The object has a side length of 0.0796. This means the object's center can range from -0.135 + 0.0796/2 to 0.135 - 0.0796/2, which is approximately -0.0952 to 0.0952. I will place the object in various locations within this range, prioritizing the center and then moving outwards.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have one object (ID 6) already placed at (0, 0, 0, 0) on surface 0. Its dimensions are 0.0796 x 0.0796. The new object (ID 5) also has square extents of 0.0857 x 0.0857. The surface is the same: 0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           I need to place object 5 such that it does not collide with object 6 and is stable on surface 0. The object 6 is centered at (0,0), so it occupies the region from -0.0398 to 0.0398 in both x and y.
           
           The new object (ID 5) has side length 0.08567. This means its center can range from -0.135 + 0.08567/2 to 0.135 - 0.08567/2, which is approximately -0.09216 to 0.09216.
           
           To avoid collision with object 6, the center of object 5 must be further than (0.0796/2 + 0.08567/2) in either x or y direction from (0,0) if aligned. This sum is approximately 0.0398 + 0.0428 = 0.0826. So, if object 5 is placed with its center at x=0, its y-coordinate must be outside the range (-0.0826, 0.0826). Similarly for x.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have two objects already placed:
           Object 6 (0.0796 x 0.0796) at (0, 0, 0, 0)
           Object 5 (0.0857 x 0.0857) at (0, 0, 0.085, 0.0)
           
           The new object (ID 4) has square extents of 0.0973 x 0.0973. The surface is the same: 0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           The maximum extent for the center of object 4 is from -0.135 + 0.0973/2 to 0.135 - 0.0973/2, which is approximately -0.08635 to 0.08635.
           
           I need to place object 4 such that it does not collide with object 6 or object 5, and is stable on surface 0.
           
           Object 6 is centered at (0,0), occupying (-0.0398, -0.0398) to (0.0398, 0.0398).
           Object 5 is centered at (0.085, 0.0), occupying (0.085 - 0.04285, 0.0 - 0.04285) to (0.085 + 0.04285, 0.0 + 0.04285), which is (0.04215, -0.04285) to (0.12785, 0.04285).
           
           Collision avoidance for object 4 (half_size = 0.0973/2 = 0.04865):
           With object 6:
           If object 4 is centered at (x4, y4), it collides with object 6 if abs(x4) < 0.0398 + 0.04865 = 0.08845 and abs(y4) < 0.0398 + 0.04865 = 0.08845.
           So, to avoid object 6, x4 must be outside (-0.08845, 0.08845) or y4 must be outside (-0.08845, 0.08845).
           However, the maximum x and y for object 4's center are approx 0.08635. This means object 4 cannot be placed with its center directly aligned with x or y axis relative to object 6 if it needs to clear object 6 entirely on one side.
           For example, if y4=0, then x4 needs to be > 0.08845 or < -0.08845 to avoid object 6. But the max allowed x for object 4's center is 0.08635. This means a direct horizontal or vertical placement to completely clear object 6 might not be possible.
           This implies I need to place object 4 in a corner region.
           
           With object 5 (center at (0.085, 0.0)):
           Collision if abs(x4 - 0.085) < 0.04285 + 0.04865 = 0.0915 and abs(y4 - 0.0) < 0.04285 + 0.04865 = 0.0915.
           
           Considering the surface bounds, max center is 0.08635.
           Let's try to place it in one of the corners of the surface, avoiding the existing objects.
           Object 6 covers x from -0.0398 to 0.0398, y from -0.0398 to 0.0398.
           Object 5 covers x from 0.04215 to 0.12785, y from -0.04285 to 0.04285.
           Combining these, the occupied region on the surface is roughly:
           x from -0.0398 to 0.12785
           y from -0.04285 to 0.04285 (roughly).
           
           I need to find a spot for object 4 (half_size = 0.04865) where its center is between -0.08635 and 0.08635 and does not overlap with the occupied regions.
           
           The only remaining large free areas are in the top-left and bottom-left quadrants, or possibly the top-right and bottom-right if I can squeeze it in the y direction past Object 5.
           
           Let's try (x,y) for object 4:
           x_max = 0.08635.
           If I place it at (x_max, y_max) or (x_max, -y_max) it will be centered at the very edge of the surface.
           Let's try the corners:
           (0.086, 0.086) - Collides with 5? x=0.086 is within 0.04215-0.12785. y=0.086 is outside -0.04285-0.04285. So it only collides if it's too close in x. If its center is at (0.086, 0.086), its x range is (0.086-0.04865, 0.086+0.04865) = (0.03735, 0.13465). This overlaps with object 5's x range (0.04215, 0.12785). The y ranges (0.03735, 0.13465) for obj 4 and (-0.04285, 0.04285) for obj 5 do not overlap. So it does not collide.
           (0.086, -0.086) - Same logic, should not collide.
           (-0.086, 0.086) - Doesn't collide with 5. Collides with 6? Center at (-0.086, 0.086). Object 6 is x:(-0.0398,0.0398), y:(-0.0398,0.0398). Object 4 x:(-0.086-0.04865, -0.086+0.04865) = (-0.13465, -0.03735). Object 4 y:(0.086-0.04865, 0.086+0.04865) = (0.03735, 0.13465). No overlap with 6.
           (-0.086, -0.086) - Same logic, should not collide with 6 or 5.
           
           So the four corner placements seem safe. I'll then explore slightly inward from there.

           (0, 0.0, 0.086, 0.0) # This will collide with object 5 if centered at (0.086, 0.0), as object 5 is centered at (0.085, 0.0). Their x-regions overlap greatly. So this is not a valid placement.
           
           Let's re-evaluate potential collision with existing objects for some candidates.
           Object 6: box (x: [-0.0398, 0.0398], y: [-0.0398, 0.0398])
           Object 5: box (x: [0.04215, 0.12785], y: [-0.04285, 0.04285])

           Candidate (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.086):
           Object 4 box (x: [-0.04865, 0.04865], y: [0.03735, 0.13465])
           Collides with 6? x overlaps ([-0.0398, 0.0398] and [-0.04865, 0.04865]). y does not overlap ([-0.0398, 0.0398] and [0.03735, 0.13465]). No collision with 6.
           Collides with 5? x does not overlap ([0.04215, 0.12785] and [-0.04865, 0.04865]). No collision with 5.
           This placement is good!
           
           Candidate (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.086):
           Object 4 box (x: [-0.04865, 0.04865], y: [-0.13465, -0.03735])
           Collides with 6? x overlaps, y does not. No collision with 6.
           Collides with 5? x does not overlap. No collision with 5.
           This placement is good!
           
           Candidate (0, 0.0, -0.086, 0.0):
           Object 4 box (x: [-0.13465, -0.03735], y: [-0.04865, 0.04865])
           Collides with 6? x does not overlap. No collision with 6.
           Collides with 5? x does not overlap. No collision with 5.
           This placement is good!
           
           So, the corner points and the midpoints along the outer edges (not conflicting with existing objects) are good candidates.
           Let's try to fill the remaining area.
           The available space is largely in the y > 0.04285 and y < -0.04285 regions, or x < -0.0398.
           
           Consider the region x < -0.0398 and abs(y) < 0.04285. The object 4 is 0.0973 wide. This means it needs a space of at least 0.0973.
           The range for x of object 4 center is [-0.08635, 0.08635].
           The range for y of object 4 center is [-0.08635, 0.08635].
           
           Let's try to distribute the points in the remaining quadrants, particularly the top-left and bottom-left, and the top-right and bottom-right away from x-axis.

Object 5 is x: (0.04215, 0.12785), y: (-0.04285, 0.04285). x ranges overlap (0.04215 to 0.09865). y ranges overlap. This is a collision.
           (0, 0.0, -0.05, 0.0) # This is likely to collide with 6 because 6 is centered at (0.0, 0.0). Object 4 at (-0.05, 0.0) is x: (-0.09865, -0.00135), y: (-0.04865, 0.04865). Object 6 is x: (-0.0398, 0.0398), y: (-0.0398, 0.0398). x ranges overlap (-0.0398 to -0.00135). y ranges overlap. This is a collision.
           
           Let me remove placements that clearly collide based on my analysis.
           Any placement of object 4 where its x-interval overlaps with object 6's x-interval AND its y-interval overlaps with object 6's y-interval will collide.
           Similarly for object 5.
           
           Object 4 has half size 0.04865.
           Object 6 is [-0.0398, 0.0398] x [-0.0398, 0.0398].
           Object 5 is [0.04215, 0.12785] x [-0.04285, 0.04285].
           
           To avoid collision with 6:
           Option A: abs(center_x) > 0.0398 + 0.04865 = 0.08845 OR abs(center_y) > 0.0398 + 0.04865 = 0.08845.
           However, the max center coordinate is 0.08635. This means object 4 cannot entirely clear object 6 on one side if placed along a cardinal axis.
           Instead, it must be placed such that one dimension does not overlap.
           If center_x is in [-0.0398, 0.0398], then it needs to clear in y. This means abs(center_y) must be > 0.0398 + 0.04865 = 0.08845.
           The max center_y is 0.08635. So if center_x is around 0, it cannot clear object 6.
           This implies no placement for object 4 centered around (0,0) will be valid if it tries to clear object 6 by being far in one axis.
           Let's check (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.086) again.
           Object 4 box (x: [-0.04865, 0.04865], y: [0.03735, 0.13465]).
           Object 6 box (x: [-0.0398, 0.0398], y: [-0.0398, 0.0398]).
           Their x-ranges DO overlap (from -0.0398 to 0.0398).
           Their y-ranges DO NOT overlap ([0.03735, 0.13465] starts after [-0.0398, 0.0398] ends).
           So this placement does NOT collide with object 6.
           My previous collision logic was slightly off for these boundary cases.
           
           Let's re-verify (0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.0). Object 4 center (0.05,0). Box x: (0.00135, 0.09865), y: (-0.04865, 0.04865).
           Object 6: x: [-0.0398, 0.0398], y: [-0.0398, 0.0398].
           Overlap in x? Yes (x from 0.00135 to 0.0398). Overlap in y? Yes (y from -0.0398 to 0.0398). So it collides with 6.
           
           Object 5: x: [0.04215, 0.12785], y: [-0.04285, 0.04285].
           Overlap in x? Yes (x from 0.04215 to 0.09865). Overlap in y? Yes (y from -0.04285 to 0.04285). So it collides with 5.
           This placement (0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.0) is definitely a collision.
           
           Let's carefully choose placements based on this revised understanding.
           The safe zones are basically the regions where the y-coordinate is outside the combined y-range of objects 5 and 6, or the x-coordinate is outside the combined x-range.
           Combined x-range of 5 and 6 is roughly [-0.0398, 0.12785].
           Combined y-range of 5 and 6 is roughly [-0.04285, 0.04285].
           
           So, if abs(y) > 0.04285 + 0.04865 = 0.0915, it won't collide with either.
           The maximum y-center for object 4 is 0.08635. This means there are no y values that entirely clear BOTH objects in the y direction alone, because 0.08635 < 0.0915.
           
           This means that if a placement overlaps in x with either object 5 or 6, it MUST clear that object in y. And vice versa.
           
           Let's focus on the safe corners first.
           The corners are safe based on my prior calculation:
           (-0.086, 0.086) - obj 4 x: (-0.13465, -0.03735). obj 6 x:(-0.0398,0.0398). No x overlap. So no collision with 6.
           obj 4 y:(0.03735, 0.13465). obj 5 x:(0.04215, 0.12785). No x overlap. So no collision with 5.
           So, these four corners are definitely safe:
           (0, 0.0, -0.086, 0.086)
           (0, 0.0, 0.086, 0.086)
           (0, 0.0, -0.086, -0.086)
           (0, 0.0, 0.086, -0.086)
           
           Now, let's explore more locations.
           (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.086)
           Obj 4 x: [-0.04865, 0.04865], y: [0.03735, 0.13465]
           Obj 6 x: [-0.0398, 0.0398], y: [-0.0398, 0.0398]. x overlap, y no overlap. No collision.
           Obj 5 x: [0.04215, 0.12785], y: [-0.04285, 0.04285]. x no overlap. No collision.
           This is also a good placement. Similarly for (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.086).
           
           What about (0, 0.0, -0.086, 0.0)?
           Obj 4 x: [-0.13465, -0.03735], y: [-0.04865, 0.04865]
           Obj 6 x: [-0.0398, 0.0398], y: [-0.0398, 0.0398]. x no overlap. No collision.
           Obj 5 x: [0.04215, 0.12785], y: [-0.04285, 0.04285]. x no overlap. No collision.
           This is also a good placement.
           
           Now I need to find 50 stable and non-colliding placements.
           I can try to spread out points within the safe quadrants, mainly the top-left and bottom-left, and then potentially top-right and bottom-right if Y is sufficiently large to clear object 5.
           Top-left quadrant for center: x in [-0.086, -0.0398-0.04865] (no, this would be to avoid x-overlap with 6).
           Let's consider the x range from -0.086 to -0.04865 (the edge of object 4 from x=0). This x range for object 4's center ensures that object 4's positive x extent does not exceed -0.04865 + 0.04865 = 0.
           So, if x_center is in [-0.086, -0.04865], and y_center is in [-0.086, 0.086], the x-range of object 4 will be entirely to the left of 0. This will avoid x-overlap with object 5.
           Now need to avoid collision with object 6.
           If x_center is in [-0.086, -0.04865], then object 4's x-extent is roughly [-0.134, 0].
           Object 6's x-extent is [-0.0398, 0.0398]. These x-extents do not overlap if max_x of obj4 is < min_x of obj6 (i.e. 0 < -0.0398, which is false) or vice versa.
           They actually do overlap slightly for x from -0.0398 to 0. So, to avoid collision with 6, the y-extent must not overlap.
           So if x_center is in [-0.086, -0.04865], then we need abs(y_center) > 0.0398 + 0.04865 = 0.08845.
           But max y_center is 0.08635. So if x_center is between -0.086 and -0.04865, then no y-center will clear 6.
           This means the only way to avoid 6 is if object 4's x-extent is entirely left of 6, i.e., x_center + 0.04865 < -0.0398, which means x_center < -0.0398 - 0.04865 = -0.08845.
           But max x_center is 0.08635. This implies it must be at x_center = -0.086.
           
           Let's retry:
           Region 1: Object 4 x-extent: x_center - 0.04865 to x_center + 0.04865
           Object 6 x-extent: -0.0398 to 0.0398
           Object 5 x-extent: 0.04215 to 0.12785
           
           A. For obj 4 to not overlap in X with obj 6:
             x_center + 0.04865 <= -0.0398  => x_center <= -0.08845 (This is not possible as x_center min is -0.086)
             OR
             x_center - 0.04865 >= 0.0398 => x_center >= 0.08845 (This is not possible as x_center max is 0.086)
           This means any placement of object 4 centered along the x-axis, if its y-extent overlaps with object 6's y-extent, will collide with object 6.
           Therefore, for object 4 to not collide with object 6:
             abs(y_center) must be > 0.0398 + 0.04865 = 0.08845.
           Since the maximum y_center is 0.08635, this condition can never be met if x_center is such that it overlaps with object 6 in x.
           This means, if x_center is in [-0.08845, 0.08845], then y_center MUST be outside [-0.08845, 0.08845].
           But the available y_center range for object 4 is [-0.08635, 0.08635].
           This means it is impossible to place object 4 such that its x-extent overlaps with object 6's x-extent, and avoid collision via y-separation.
           
           This is a critical observation. Let me recheck the math.
           Object 4 has half width (hw4) = 0.04865.
           Object 6 has half width (hw6) = 0.0398.
           Object 6 is centered at (0,0). Its x-range is [-hw6, hw6]. Its y-range is [-hw6, hw6].
           For object 4 (center at cx4, cy4) to not collide with object 6:
           abs(cx4) >= hw4 + hw6 = 0.04865 + 0.0398 = 0.08845
           OR
           abs(cy4) >= hw4 + hw6 = 0.04865 + 0.0398 = 0.08845
           
           The max x and y for center of object 4 is 0.135 - hw4 = 0.135 - 0.04865 = 0.08635.
           So, the conditions are:
           abs(cx4) >= 0.08845 OR abs(cy4) >= 0.08845.
           However, the maximum value for abs(cx4) or abs(cy4) is 0.08635.
           Since 0.08635 < 0.08845, it means there are NO valid positions for object 4 that avoid object 6.
           This seems wrong, as typically objects can be placed. Let me re-read the problem statement.
           
           The problem states "the object is fully contained within the bounds of the surface".
           So, if the object is placed at (0, 0, 0, 0.086), object 4's x-range is [-0.04865, 0.04865].
           Object 6's x-range is [-0.0398, 0.0398]. These x-ranges OVERLAP.
           Object 4's y-range is [0.086 - 0.04865, 0.086 + 0.04865] = [0.03735, 0.13465].
           Object 6's y-range is [-0.0398, 0.0398]. These y-ranges do NOT overlap.
           Since there's no overlap in y, there is NO collision between object 4 at (0, 0, 0.0, 0.086) and object 6. This is a valid placement.
           
           My general collision condition "abs(cx4) >= hw4 + hw6 OR abs(cy4) >= hw4 + hw6" is for the centers only, not for the extents.
           The actual collision condition for two axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) objA (center_x_A, center_y_A, half_width_A, half_height_A) and objB (center_x_B, center_y_B, half_width_B, half_height_B) is:
           !( abs(center_x_A - center_x_B) >= half_width_A + half_width_B OR abs(center_y_A - center_y_B) >= half_height_A + half_height_B )
           
           For object 4 (cx4, cy4, 0.04865, 0.04865) and object 6 (0, 0, 0.0398, 0.0398):
           Collision if:
           (abs(cx4) < 0.04865 + 0.0398 AND abs(cy4) < 0.04865 + 0.0398)
           (abs(cx4) < 0.08845 AND abs(cy4) < 0.08845)
           
           So, to AVOID collision with object 6:
           abs(cx4) >= 0.08845 OR abs(cy4) >= 0.08845.
           
           This means my previous conclusion was actually correct. My understanding of AABB collision logic had a temporary lapse.
           Given that max abs(cx4) and abs(cy4) is 0.08635, which is less than 0.08845, it is indeed IMPOSSIBLE to place object 4 without colliding with object 6.
           This would mean the problem setup implies no solution, which is highly unlikely for these challenges.
           
           Is there a subtlety in "stable placement" that I'm missing? Or maybe my interpretation of collision is too strict?
           "the object is fully contained within the bounds of the surface."
           "whether a placement is stable and whether it collides with any of the fixed obstacles in the scene."
           The problem description does not specify "no overlap". It says "no collision".
           
           Let's assume my collision check is correct and this object cannot be placed without colliding with object 6.
           This is a very small surface and the objects are relatively large.
           Let's recheck the numbers one more time.
           Surface: [-0.135, 0.135] x [-0.135, 0.135]
           Object 4 size: 0.09732. Half-size (h4) = 0.04866.
           Max center for obj 4: 0.135 - 0.04866 = 0.08634. So cx4, cy4 in [-0.08634, 0.08634].
           
           Object 6 size: 0.0796. Half-size (h6) = 0.0398. Centered at (0,0).
           Collision if abs(cx4) < h4 + h6 AND abs(cy4) < h4 + h6
           Collision if abs(cx4) < 0.04866 + 0.0398 = 0.08846 AND abs(cy4) < 0.04866 + 0.0398 = 0.08846.
           
           Since the maximum possible value for abs(cx4) or abs(cy4) is 0.08634, which is less than 0.08846,
           then it is IMPOSSIBLE to satisfy either abs(cx4) >= 0.08846 or abs(cy4) >= 0.08846.
           This means that for any valid center (cx4, cy4), the condition (abs(cx4) < 0.08846 AND abs(cy4) < 0.08846) will always be true.
           This means object 4 will *always* collide with object 6.
           
           This can't be right. What if the previously placed objects are not *fixed obstacles* but rather *other movable objects* that can be moved or ignored for this specific placement?
           "You will be given feedback of whether a placement is stable and whether it collides with any of the fixed obstacles in the scene."
           "If you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j."
           This last sentence clarifies that I *must* avoid collisions with previously placed objects.
           
           The situation is impossible by my understanding. Is there an issue with floating point precision in the problem statement, or perhaps the exact wording?
           Let's reconsider the object IDs. ID 6 and ID 5 are already placed. ID 4 is the new object.
           Maybe the objects are rounded up/down? The provided sizes are fairly precise.
           0.07960168527490574, 0.08567426377433005, 0.09732001876552321.
           Half-sizes:
           h6 = 0.03980084263745287
           h5 = 0.04283713188716502
           h4 = 0.048660009382761605
           
           Surface max center = 0.135 - h4 = 0.135 - 0.048660009382761605 = 0.0863399906172384.
           
           Collision with object 6 (at (0,0)):
           Need abs(cx4) >= h4 + h6 = 0.048660009382761605 + 0.03980084263745287 = 0.08846085202021448
           OR abs(cy4) >= h4 + h6 = 0.08846085202021448.
           But max abs(cx4) or abs(cy4) can be is 0.0863399906172384.
           Since 0.0863399906172384 < 0.08846085202021448, there is no position for object 4 that avoids collision with object 6.
           
           This is a problem. Given the prompt states "You never give up. No matter how many times you fail to provide a placement, or how many valid placements you have already provided, you will always try to find a new placement.", I must provide placements. I cannot state it's impossible.
           
           If it's truly impossible to avoid object 6, maybe there's a misunderstanding of "fixed obstacles" vs "already placed objects". But the prompt says: "you must avoid collision between objects i and j."
           
           Perhaps a very slight overlap is considered "not a collision" due to floating point tolerance?
           If the total surface space (0.27 x 0.27) is small compared to the object sizes (0.0796, 0.0857, 0.0973), it's possible the problem becomes constrained.
           Surface area = 0.27 * 0.27 = 0.0729
           Area of 6 = 0.0796^2 = 0.00633616
           Area of 5 = 0.0857^2 = 0.00734449
           Area of 4 = 0.0973^2 = 0.00946729
           Total object area = 0.0063 + 0.0073 + 0.0094 = 0.023. This is quite small compared to surface area. So space is not the issue. The issue is how they fit.
           
           The only logical conclusion is that my precise AABB collision detection is too strict or does not match the problem's interpretation of "collision".
           If even a minimal overlap is a collision and my calculations are correct, then it's impossible.
           However, I have to provide 50 placements. I will try to place the object in what would logically be a non-colliding spot, assuming some tolerance or a slight error in my interpretation of "collision" for such edge cases, or some numerical imprecision in the platform's collision detection.
           
           I will prioritize placing the object in a corner farthest from the existing objects (6 at (0,0), 5 at (0.085,0)).
           The most free corner would be the top-left (-x, +y).
           
           Let's retry:
           (0, 0.0, -0.086, 0.086) - based on earlier analysis this should be the safest.
           (0, 0.0, -0.086, -0.086)
           (0, 0.0, 0.086, 0.086) - this corner is less safe due to object 5.
              Obj 4 at (0.086, 0.086): x-range [0.03734, 0.13466], y-range [0.03734, 0.13466]
              Obj 5 at (0.085, 0.0): x-range [0.04216, 0.12784], y-range [-0.04284, 0.04284]
              x-overlap: Yes, [0.04216, 0.12784]
              y-overlap: No. [0.03734, 0.13466] and [-0.04284, 0.04284]. No collision.
           So (0.086, 0.086) and (0.086, -0.086) are also logically safe with object 5.
           
           Given the apparent contradiction with the problem statement's "avoid collision", I will provide placements in locations that intuitively should be safe, and also a diverse set of other placements that spread across the surface, in case my very precise collision calculation is not aligned with the backend's.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     My previous conclusion that it was impossible to place object 4 without collision was clearly incorrect, as the system provided a successful placement: `(ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, -0.086, 0.086`. This means my AABB collision logic might be slightly off compared to the system's, or there's a tolerance.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the collision logic using the successful placement of object 4:
           Object 4 half-size (h4) = 0.09732001876552321 / 2 = 0.048660009382761605.
           Object 4 placed at (cx4, cy4) = (-0.086, 0.086).
           Its AABB is (cx4-h4, cx4+h4) x (cy4-h4, cy4+h4) = (-0.086-0.04866, -0.086+0.04866) x (0.086-0.04866, 0.086+0.04866)
           = [-0.13466, -0.03734] x [0.03734, 0.13466].
           
           Let's check for collision with object 6:
           Object 6 half-size (h6) = 0.07960168527490574 / 2 = 0.03980084263745287.
           Object 6 placed at (0,0). Its AABB is [-0.03980, 0.03980] x [-0.03980, 0.03980].
           Collision occurs if their x-intervals overlap AND their y-intervals overlap.
           Object 4 x-interval: [-0.13466, -0.03734].
           Object 6 x-interval: [-0.03980, 0.03980].
           These x-intervals overlap from -0.03980 to -0.03734. (Since -0.03734 > -0.03980).
           Object 4 y-interval: [0.03734, 0.13466].
           Object 6 y-interval: [-0.03980, 0.03980].
           These y-intervals DO NOT overlap (0.03734 > 0.03980 is false; 0.03734 is less than 0.03980). This means there is a gap between the positive y-side of object 6 and the negative y-side of object 4.
           So, according to my detailed AABB overlap check, object 4 and object 6 do NOT collide, which matches the successful placement feedback. My previous "impossible" conclusion was based on a simplified center-to-center distance check, which is only valid if objects are perfectly aligned or for a quick approximate check.
           
           Let's check for collision with object 5:
           Object 5 half-size (h5) = 0.08567426377433005 / 2 = 0.04283713188716502.
           Object 5 placed at (0.085, 0.0). Its AABB is (0.085-h5, 0.085+h5) x (0-h5, 0+h5)
           = [0.085-0.04284, 0.085+0.04284] x [-0.04284, 0.04284]
           = [0.04216, 0.12784] x [-0.04284, 0.04284].
           Object 4 x-interval: [-0.13466, -0.03734].
           Object 5 x-interval: [0.04216, 0.12784].
           These x-intervals DO NOT overlap. So, object 4 and object 5 do NOT collide.
           
           The system's collision detection is standard AABB overlap, and my detailed check seems to match.
           
           Now for the new object (ID 7):
           Object 7 extents: (size_x, size_y) = (0.09521438698222472, 0.09521438698222467). It's square.
           Half-size (h7) = 0.09521438698222472 / 2 = 0.04760719349111236.
           Surface: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Max center for obj 7: 0.135 - h7 = 0.135 - 0.04760719349111236 = 0.08739280650888764.
           So, (cx7, cy7) must be in [-0.08739, 0.08739].
           
           Existing objects:
           ID 6: half-size (h6) = 0.03980. Center (0,0). AABB: [-0.03980, 0.03980] x [-0.03980, 0.03980].
           ID 5: half-size (h5) = 0.04284. Center (0.085, 0.0). AABB: [0.04216, 0.12784] x [-0.04284, 0.04284].
           ID 4: half-size (h4) = 0.04866. Center (-0.086, 0.086). AABB: [-0.13466, -0.03734] x [0.03734, 0.13466].
           
           I need to find a (cx7, cy7) for object 7 that is within surface bounds and does not collide with 6, 5, or 4.
           
           Let's look for a corner not heavily used.
           The bottom-right corner seems like a good candidate for object 7.
           Let's try (0.087, -0.087) for cx7, cy7 (close to max possible value).
           Object 7 AABB at (0.087, -0.087):
           x: [0.087-0.04761, 0.087+0.04761] = [0.03939, 0.13461]
           y: [-0.087-0.04761, -0.087+0.04761] = [-0.13461, -0.03939]
           
           Check collision with 6:
           Obj 7 x: [0.03939, 0.13461] vs Obj 6 x: [-0.03980, 0.03980]. No x-overlap. No collision.
           Check collision with 5:
           Obj 7 x: [0.03939, 0.13461] vs Obj 5 x: [0.04216, 0.12784]. X-overlap. [0.04216, 0.12784]
           Obj 7 y: [-0.13461, -0.03939] vs Obj 5 y: [-0.04284, 0.04284]. Y-overlap? No, -0.03939 > -0.04284. Yes, the ranges overlap between -0.04284 and -0.03939. This would be a collision.
           
           My math for y-overlap between 7 and 5:
           Obj 7 min y = -0.13461, max y = -0.03939.
           Obj 5 min y = -0.04284, max y = 0.04284.
           Overlap? max(Obj7_min_y, Obj5_min_y) = max(-0.13461, -0.04284) = -0.04284.
           min(Obj7_max_y, Obj5_max_y) = min(-0.03939, 0.04284) = -0.03939.
           Since -0.04284 < -0.03939, there IS an overlap. So, (0.087, -0.087) collides with object 5.
           
           This means placing object 7 at the very corners is also tricky.
           Let's find the areas that are not covered:
           Area occupied by object 6: [-0.03980, 0.03980] x [-0.03980, 0.03980]
           Area occupied by object 5: [0.04216, 0.12784] x [-0.04284, 0.04284]
           Area occupied by object 4: [-0.13466, -0.03734] x [0.03734, 0.13466]
           
           Let's look at quadrants for object 7's center (cx7, cy7), keeping in mind its size and the max center (0.08739).
           Region 1: x < -0.03980 (left of 6's left edge)
           Region 2: x > 0.03980 (right of 6's right edge)
           Region 3: y < -0.03980 (below 6's bottom edge)
           Region 4: y > 0.03980 (above 6's top edge)
           
           Consider the top-right part of the surface. Max cx7, cy7 = 0.08739.
           Try (0.087, 0.087) as a center for Obj 7.
           Obj 7 AABB: [0.087-h7, 0.087+h7] x [0.087-h7, 0.087+h7] = [0.03939, 0.13461] x [0.03939, 0.13461]
           
           Collision with 6:
           Obj 7 x: [0.03939, 0.13461] vs Obj 6 x: [-0.03980, 0.03980]. No x-overlap. No collision.
           Collision with 5:
           Obj 7 x: [0.03939, 0.13461] vs Obj 5 x: [0.04216, 0.12784]. X-overlap.
           Obj 7 y: [0.03939, 0.13461] vs Obj 5 y: [-0.04284, 0.04284]. No y-overlap. No collision.
           This placement (0, 0.0, 0.087, 0.087) looks promising!
           
           Collision with 4:
           Obj 7 x: [0.03939, 0.13461] vs Obj 4 x: [-0.13466, -0.03734]. No x-overlap. No collision.
           
           So, (0, 0.0, 0.087, 0.087) is a stable and non-colliding placement. Let's start with this one and explore similar areas.
           Due to the sizes, placing objects side-by-side or directly above/below each other is very tight. I will prioritize filling the "empty" quadrants or edges.
           
           The 'top-left' was taken by Obj 4.
           The 'center' by Obj 6.
           The 'right-center' by Obj 5.
           The 'top-right' at (0.087, 0.087) seems good.
           Let's try 'bottom-left' (-0.087, -0.087).
           Obj 7 AABB: [-0.13461, -0.03939] x [-0.13461, -0.03939].
           Collision with 6:
           Obj 7 x: [-0.13461, -0.03939] vs Obj 6 x: [-0.03980, 0.03980]. X-overlap (-0.03980 to -0.03939).
           Obj 7 y: [-0.13461, -0.03939] vs Obj 6 y: [-0.03980, 0.03980]. Y-overlap (-0.03980 to -0.03939).
           This means (0.0, -0.087, -0.087) WILL collide with object 6. My previous intuition was wrong.
           
           My AABB check needs to be precise:
           Overlap in x: max(a.min_x, b.min_x) < min(a.max_x, b.max_x)
           Overlap in y: max(a.min_y, b.min_y) < min(a.max_y, b.max_y)
           Collision if (Overlap in x AND Overlap in y).
           
           Let's recheck (0.087, -0.087) with 5.
           Obj 7 AABB: x: [0.03939, 0.13461], y: [-0.13461, -0.03939].
           Obj 5 AABB: x: [0.04216, 0.12784], y: [-0.04284, 0.04284].
           X overlap: max(0.03939, 0.04216)=0.04216, min(0.13461, 0.12784)=0.12784. 0.04216 < 0.12784, so X overlaps.
           Y overlap: max(-0.13461, -0.04284)=-0.04284, min(-0.03939, 0.04284)=-0.03939. -0.04284 < -0.03939, so Y overlaps.
           Collision with 5. This is correct.
           
           So the available space is even more restricted.
           The free regions are generally areas that are far enough from *all* existing objects.
           The combined bounding box of already placed objects is roughly:
           Min X: Obj 4 min X = -0.13466
           Max X: Obj 5 max X = 0.12784
           Min Y: Obj 6 min Y = -0.03980 (Obj 5 min Y = -0.04284. Obj 4 min Y = 0.03734. The actual lowest is Obj 5)
           Max Y: Obj 4 max Y = 0.13466
           
           Combined Occupied X: [-0.13466, 0.12784] (almost the full width)
           Combined Occupied Y: [-0.04284, 0.13466] (upper part and some of center)
           
           This leaves a significant free area in the bottom-right part of the surface where Y is less than -0.04284.
           Let's try placements with cy7 < -0.04284.
           The max y for object 7 is 0.08739. So cy7 in [-0.08739, -0.04284 - h7] (if clearing object 5).
           If cy7 is low enough to clear object 5 AND object 6 in y:
           cy7 < -0.04284 - h7 = -0.04284 - 0.04761 = -0.09045.
           The lowest possible cy7 is -0.08739. This cannot be met.
           So object 7 will always overlap in Y with object 5 (and probably 6 too) if its Y-center is above -0.09045.
           This means for any such placement, it must clear objects 5 and 6 in X.
           
           So, if cy7 is in [-0.08739, 0.08739]
           And cx7 is in [-0.08739, 0.08739]
           
           Let's try to place object 7 in the region where y < -0.04284 (below object 5).
           The center of object 7 needs to be such that its y-extent [cy7-h7, cy7+h7] does not overlap with existing objects.
           For object 5 (y_range [-0.04284, 0.04284]): cy7+h7 <= -0.04284 => cy7 <= -0.04284 - h7 = -0.09045.
           This is not possible since min cy7 is -0.08739.
           So object 7 will always collide with object 5 if its x-interval overlaps with object 5's x-interval.
           This means for cx7 in [0.04216 - h7, 0.12784 + h7] (roughly [ -0.005, 0.175]), the y-interval must be non-overlapping.
           
           This problem is very tricky with such large objects on a small surface.
           The only way to avoid collision is to be outside the 'influence zones' of all objects in at least one dimension.
           Let's analyze the free areas again.
           The object 4 at (-0.086, 0.086) takes up most of the top-left corner.
           The object 6 at (0,0) takes up the very center.
           The object 5 at (0.085,0) takes up part of the right-center.
           
           Let's try to place object 7 in regions that are "empty".
           There is a sliver of space to the right of object 4.
           Obj 4 max X = -0.03734.
           So if cx7 - h7 > -0.03734 => cx7 > -0.03734 + h7 = -0.03734 + 0.04761 = 0.01027.
           And if cy7 < 0.03734 (below object 4's lower edge).
           
           So, if cx7 > 0.01027 AND cy7 < 0.03734.
           This region (x positive, y negative/small positive) is somewhat occupied by 5 and 6.
           
           Let's look at the remaining surface area:
           It seems the bottom-most edge of the surface, with y values below all current objects, might be the only place.
           Max Y for object 6 is 0.03980. Max Y for object 5 is 0.04284. Min Y for object 4 is 0.03734.
           The lowest region occupied is by object 5 at -0.04284.
           
           So, if cy7 + h7 <= -0.04284 => cy7 <= -0.04284 - h7 = -0.09045.
           The allowed range for cy7 is [-0.08739, 0.08739].
           So there are no valid y-centers that can clear object 5 from below.
           This implies if object 7's x-extent overlaps with object 5's x-extent, it will collide.
           
           This is getting extremely difficult. If my collision logic is exactly what the system uses, there simply might not be enough room for the fourth object.
           However, the problem implies there should be a solution. I will generate a diverse set of placements in corners and along edges, hoping that some subtle numerical tolerance or edge-case behavior allows one of them through.
           
           Placements:
           (0, 0.0, 0.087, 0.087) # Top-right corner, passed all checks.
           (0, 0.0, -0.087, 0.0) # Left edge, cleared 4, 5, 6 due to x-separation with 5 and 6 and y-separation with 4.
              Obj 7 x: [-0.13461, -0.03939], y: [-0.04761, 0.04761]
              vs 6 (0,0): X overlap, Y overlap. Collision! This is not good.
              vs 5 (0.085,0): No X overlap. No collision.
              vs 4 (-0.086,0.086): No X overlap. No collision.
           So (0, 0.0, -0.087, 0.0) collides with 6.
           
           I am back to the same problem: all "intuitive" placements collide due to the precise AABB overlap.
           I'm running out of options that follow strict AABB collision.
           The only scenario where this is not impossible is if there is some hidden tolerance for collision detection, or that the previous successful placements were slightly modified.
           
           Let me re-check the previous successful placements from a fresh perspective.
           Obj 6 (0, 0, 0, 0) extents [-0.0398, 0.0398] x [-0.0398, 0.0398]
           Obj 5 (0, 0, 0.085, 0.0) extents [0.04216, 0.12784] x [-0.04284, 0.04284]
           Obj 4 (0, 0, -0.086, 0.086) extents [-0.13466, -0.03734] x [0.03734, 0.13466]
           
           Space to the right of Obj 5: x > 0.12784. Max x center 0.08739. Can't fit there.
           Space to the left of Obj 4: x < -0.13466. Min x center -0.08739. Can't fit there.
           Space above Obj 4: y > 0.13466. Max y center 0.08739. Can't fit there.
           Space below Obj 5: y < -0.04284. Max y center 0.08739. Min y center -0.08739.
           Need cy7 + h7 <= -0.04284 => cy7 <= -0.04284 - 0.04761 = -0.09045. But min cy7 is -0.08739. So cannot fully clear below Obj 5.
           
           This leaves only one option: there's a space between objects, or between an object and the edge of the surface.
           Specifically, for placement (0.087, 0.087) for object 7.
           Obj 7: [0.03939, 0.13461] x [0.03939, 0.13461]
           Check against 6: no x overlap. OK.
           Check against 5: X overlap but no Y overlap. Obj 7 Y is [0.03939, 0.13461], Obj 5 Y is [-0.04284, 0.04284]. No Y overlap. OK.
           Check against 4: no x overlap. OK.
           So, (0, 0.0, 0.087, 0.087) should indeed be a valid placement.
           
           Let's try to place it at (0.087, -0.087) and see if I miscalculated the Y overlap with object 5.
           Obj 7 at (0.087, -0.087): x: [0.03939, 0.13461], y: [-0.13461, -0.03939]
           Obj 5: x: [0.04216, 0.12784], y: [-0.04284, 0.04284]
           X overlap: Yes.
           Y overlap: max(Obj7_min_y, Obj5_min_y) = max(-0.13461, -0.04284) = -0.04284
           min(Obj7_max_y, Obj5_max_y) = min(-0.03939, 0.04284) = -0.03939
           Since -0.04284 < -0.03939, there IS a Y overlap. So this placement COLLIDES with object 5.
           
           The space is extremely tight. My best bet is to fill the available "corners" on the surface, making sure they clear existing objects in at least one dimension.
           I'll stick with the top-right corner being the most promising, and then try points moving away from the occupied regions.
           
           Placements:
           (0, 0.0, 0.087, 0.087)
           (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.087)
           (0, 0.0, 0.07, 0.087)
           (0, 0.0, 0.06, 0.087)
           (0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.087)
           (0, 0.0, 0.04, 0.087)
           (0, 0.0, 0.03, 0.087)
           (0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.087)
           (0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.087)
           (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.087) # x: [-0.04761, 0.04761], y: [0.03939, 0.13461]. Collides with 6 (x-overlap, y-overlap). This is a collision. My assumption that it clears 6 based on y value being large enough needs re-evaluation.
           Let's re-verify this:
           Obj 7 center (0, 0.087)
           Obj 7 AABB x: [-0.04761, 0.04761], y: [0.03939, 0.13461].
           Obj 6 AABB x: [-0.03980, 0.03980], y: [-0.03980, 0.03980].
           X overlap: max(-0.04761, -0.03980)=-0.03980, min(0.04761, 0.03980)=0.03980. Overlap.
           Y overlap: max(0.03939, -0.03980)=0.03939, min(0.13461, 0.03980)=0.03980. Overlap.
           Yes, (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.087) collides with object 6.
           
           This is a very difficult placement problem given the object sizes and the existing fixed placements. The space is indeed very tight. It's likely only a very small number of positions are actually valid.
           I need to be very precise:
           Object 7 AABB: (cx7-h7, cx7+h7) x (cy7-h7, cy7+h7)
           h7 = 0.04761
           
           Valid placements require clearing ALL previous objects.
           The areas where object 7's center (cx7, cy7) is located must satisfy:
           NOT (AABB_7 overlaps AABB_6) AND NOT (AABB_7 overlaps AABB_5) AND NOT (AABB_7 overlaps AABB_4).
           
           This implies the only safe zones are those that completely clear at least one axis for each existing object.
           
           Let's retry:
           1. (0.087, 0.087) - confirmed good.
           2. (0.087, 0.05) - let's check:
              Obj 7 x: [0.03939, 0.13461], y: [0.00239, 0.09761]
              vs 6: x no overlap. OK.
              vs 5: x overlap, y overlap ([0.00239, 0.09761] vs [-0.04284, 0.04284]). Yes, y-overlap from 0.00239 to 0.04284. COLLISION.
           
           It looks like the top-right quadrant where Y is large is the only one working, and that's only at the very edge.
           I will place many points in the top-right corner, in case the platform has a slightly different collision tolerance.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have four objects already placed. This is getting extremely tight!
           Object 6 (h6=0.03980) at (0,0) -> AABB [-0.03980, 0.03980] x [-0.03980, 0.03980]
           Object 5 (h5=0.04284) at (0.085,0) -> AABB [0.04216, 0.12784] x [-0.04284, 0.04284]
           Object 4 (h4=0.04866) at (-0.086,0.086) -> AABB [-0.13466, -0.03734] x [0.03734, 0.13466]
           Object 7 (h7=0.04761) at (0.087,0.087) -> AABB [0.03939, 0.13461] x [0.03939, 0.13461]
           
           New object (ID 8): square extents (0.09449, 0.09449).
           Half-size (h8) = 0.0944921966944211 / 2 = 0.04724609834721055.
           Max center for obj 8: 0.135 - h8 = 0.135 - 0.04724609834721055 = 0.08775390165278945.
           So, (cx8, cy8) must be in [-0.08775, 0.08775].
           
           Let's quickly check the combined occupied area for previous objects:
           Min X: -0.13466 (from 4)
           Max X: 0.13461 (from 7) (just under the surface max of 0.135)
           Min Y: -0.04284 (from 5)
           Max Y: 0.13466 (from 4) (just under the surface max of 0.135)
           
           Effectively, the horizontal space from -0.13466 to 0.13461 is occupied. This is almost the entire surface width.
           The vertical space from -0.04284 to 0.13466 is occupied. This is also a large chunk.
           
           This means the only remaining areas are potentially in the very bottom part of the surface, below Y = -0.04284.
           Let's try to place object 8 with its center `cy8` as low as possible.
           Min `cy8` is -0.08775.
           If `cy8 = -0.08775`, then object 8's Y-extent is:
           [-0.08775 - 0.04725, -0.08775 + 0.04725] = [-0.135, -0.0405].
           This Y-extent is entirely below the Y-extents of all existing objects (Max Y of Obj 5 is -0.04284, Max Y of Obj 6 is 0.03980, Max Y of Obj 4 is 0.13466, Max Y of Obj 7 is 0.13461).
           So, if `cy8 = -0.08775`, object 8 will not collide with any existing object due to Y-separation.
           Now I only need to ensure its X-extent is within surface bounds.
           `cx8` can be anywhere in [-0.08775, 0.08775].
           
           So, I can fill the bottom strip of the surface with object 8.
           For example, (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.08775).
           Obj 8 AABB x: [-0.04725, 0.04725], y: [-0.135, -0.0405].
           This clears all existing objects in Y.
           
           This is a much clearer scenario for placement!
