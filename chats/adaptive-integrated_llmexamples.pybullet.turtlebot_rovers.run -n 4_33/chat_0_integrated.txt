           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` is a complex axiom that requires several conditions to be met, specifically:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`
           - `free(v12, v16)`
           - `free(v14, v16)`
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v20, v11)`
           - `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (where `?stone` refers to objects of type `v2`)
           - `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (where `?soil` refers to objects of type `v6`)
           
           Let's break down what's already true in the initial state and what needs to be achieved:
           
           **Already True:**
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover `v12` is at configuration `v13`.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover `v14` is at configuration `v15`.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: Rover `v12` has a free store `v16`.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: Rover `v14` has a free store `v16`.
           
           **To Achieve:**
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v20, v11)`
           - `receivedanalysis(v4)` (type `v2` rock)
           - `receivedanalysis(v1)` (type `v2` rock)
           - `receivedanalysis(v3)` (type `v2` rock)
           - `receivedanalysis(v7)` (type `v6` rock)
           - `receivedanalysis(v5)` (type `v6` rock)
           - `receivedanalysis(v8)` (type `v6` rock)
           
           **Strategy:**
           
           1.  **Image Reception:** To achieve `receivedimage`, a rover needs to `take_image` and then `send_image`. This requires the camera to be `calibrated`. We have `rover(v12)` and `rover(v14)`, both with `camera(v10)` onboard and supporting `mode(v11)`. Both have `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates defined for the relevant objectives and lander.
               *   We can use `v14` for imaging since it has image visibility to all target objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) from configuration `#o3` and communication visibility to the lander `v9` from configuration `#o0`.
               *   Alternatively, `v12` also has image visibility from `#o3` to the same objectives and communication visibility from `#o0` to `v9`.
               *   Since the goal requires *all* these images, we need to perform `calibrate`, `take_image`, and `send_image` for each objective `v17, v18, v19, v20`.
           
           2.  **Analysis Reception:** To achieve `receivedanalysis`, a rover needs to `sample_rock` and then `send_analysis`. This requires the rover to be `above` the rock and have a `free` store. We have rocks `v4`, `v1`, `v3` (type `v2`) and `v7`, `v5`, `v8` (type `v6`). Both `v12` and `v14` are `above` all these rocks at configuration `#o5`. Both rovers have `free(v16)`.
               *   Since we need to analyze all rocks, we can use `v14` for sampling since it can reach all rocks from configuration `#o5` and has communication visibility to `v9` from `#o0`.
               *   `v12` is also suitable.
               *   We can sample all 6 rocks with one rover. Since there's only one store `v16` mentioned for both rovers, and `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true, it implies they share the same store. If we sample a rock, the store becomes `full`, and we would need to `drop_rock` to sample another. However, the problem statement states `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true. This means *each* rover has a free store of type `v16`. Since there are multiple rocks of both types, and each rover can sample one, we can distribute the sampling. Or, a single rover could sample, send analysis, then drop, and repeat. Given the limited actions, and to satisfy the `analyzed` predicate, we should prioritize sampling unique rocks.
               *   Let's check the available actions: only `move` and `drop_rock` actions are listed. No `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis` actions are available in the provided list. This means the goal is *unachievable* with the given available actions.
           
           Upon reviewing the provided "list of valid action instances", I find that `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` are *not* present. Only `move` and `drop_rock` actions are available. Since the goal requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates, which can only be achieved by `take_image`/`send_image` and `sample_rock`/`send_analysis` respectively, and these actions are not available, the goal cannot be achieved.
           
           Therefore, no plan can be generated.
