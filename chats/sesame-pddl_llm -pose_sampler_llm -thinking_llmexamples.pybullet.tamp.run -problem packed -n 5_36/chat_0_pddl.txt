(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to determine 50 stable placements for object ID 4 on a given surface. This object is nearly square with dimensions `0.08375...` by `0.08375...`. The target surface is a square centered at (0,0) with sides of length 0.27.
           
           The strategy I'll employ focuses on generating a diverse set of positions and orientations. First, I'll systematically vary the object's orientation (`theta`) using 5 evenly spaced angles from 0 to pi/2. Since the AABB extents repeat every pi/2 radians, I'll cover all unique orientations with this range.
           
           For each orientation, I will compute the valid range for the object's center coordinates (`x` and `y`) ensuring its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) remains fully within the surface bounds. I will do this by taking the minimum and maximum coordinates.
           
           To ensure even coverage of valid space, I will generate a 4x4 grid of positions for each value of `theta`. This will generate more than 50 total placements, so I can simply take the first 50. This creates a diverse set of stable object placements, covering both rotational and positional variations, appropriate for this task.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed Object 4. Now, I need to find 50 stable placements for a new, slightly larger, object (ID 5) on Surface 0, making sure it doesn't collide with Object 4.  Surface 0 is a square, and I know where Object 4 is located.
           
           My plan is to generate a bunch of potential placement points, or *candidate points*, for Object 5 on Surface 0. Then, I'll check each point to see if the bounding box of Object 5, based on the rotation and proposed position, collides with the bounding box of the already placed Object 4. This collision check will be the filter for bad positions. I can then use the remaining points to satisfy the request.
           
           First things first, I define Object 4's bounding box and area occupied on the surface. Since Object 4 is successfully placed, I know its extents: an area in the bottom-left corner of the square surface. This takes up about 30% of the area in the bottom left. Then, I define the key parameters for Object 5, particularly its dimensions. Using these dimensions and rotations between 0 degrees and 90 degrees I will then calculate its valid placement area.
           
           The surface is a square so calculations will remain easy. I will calculate 5 different orientations for Object 5, from 0 degrees (aligned with the axes) to 90 degrees (45 degrees increments), so that I can generate multiple valid positions.
           
           Then, I need to generate an equal spacing grid within the valid bounding area and ensure no overlap with Object 4. So I define valid minimum and maximum positions to make sure it will be stable on Surface 0.
           
           Based on the angle, I calculate the `effective_half_width` and `effective_half_height` to know the bounding box that Object 5 occupies in any specific angle and then make sure the center points are in a stable position and free to collide.
           
           After I generate the valid grid, I check for collision on the grid points to filter bad points. If there is a collision, then I discard that point and consider the next candidate point. I will do this in the current bounding area.
           This will lead to more than enough candidate points.
           
           After applying the filters, if the grid had enough space, I should have 50 unique positions!

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 7**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for Object ID 7 on Surface 0, ensuring they don't collide with existing objects (IDs 4 and 5). Object 7 is nearly square, with dimensions of roughly 0.091 units. Surface 0's bounds are (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           My strategy involves generating a grid of potential placement centers for Object 7, at various orientations. For each orientation (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2), I'll calculate the valid ranges for Object 7's center, ensuring it stays within Surface 0's boundaries. I'll then create a grid of center points within these valid ranges.
           
           For each candidate center, I'll calculate Object 7's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) and check for collisions against the AABBs of Objects 4 and 5. A collision occurs if the AABBs overlap on both the x and y axes. I know the positions and sizes of the two fixed obstacles, and I will be using those to avoid collisions. The first placement was a collision.
           
           I'll generate a list of 50 non-colliding placements and stop once the criteria is met. I'm leveraging the robust AABB collision checking to accurately predict the system's "collision" criteria. By doing this, I should be able to ensure these placements will work.
