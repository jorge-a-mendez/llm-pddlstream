           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachability**
           
           I've been tasked with developing a plan to achieve the `new-axiom@0()` goal using the provided actions. After a meticulous breakdown of the goal and its preconditions, it's immediately clear that the rovers' current configurations present a significant obstacle. Specifically, the rovers (`v12` and `v14`) are currently at configurations `v13` and `v15` respectively, and the provided `move` actions are limited to "self-loop" moves that don't change their current configurations.
           
           To achieve the goal, I need to perform image capture, analysis, and data transmission. These actions have specific preconditions relating to the rovers' configurations and their visibility to various communication and observation points. However, the rovers need to be at configuration `#o0` to perform `send_image` and `send_analysis`. However, they cannot move to this configuration. Furthermore, analysis and imaging require access to various objects, each linked with unique configuration points that are unreachable because of current `atconf` state. This means it is not possible to satisfy the preconditions for the necessary actions. The rovers are effectively stuck, and the required actions can't be executed because of these self-loops.
