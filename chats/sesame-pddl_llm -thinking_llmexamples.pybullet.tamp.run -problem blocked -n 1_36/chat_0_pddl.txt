           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Path to New Knowledge**
           
           Alright, let's break down this plan to achieve `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which I interpret as needing an object of a specific type *on* another object. My initial assessment is that I need to find something of type `v17` and get it `on v18`. I see two candidates initially, `v8` and `v12`. Examining the current state, neither are on v18.
           
           My immediate thought is to determine what needs to be done. A quick look at the actions and objects available to me reveals that I can move either `v8` or `v12` to `v18`. I see `pose` and `supported` facts that lead me to understand that I need to stack either of these objects onto v18.
           
           I decide to focus on moving `v8`, because there are actions that let me do so.  I need to pick it up and then place it on `v18`.  `Kin` and `atpose` facts suggest that `v8` is currently located at `v9`. `Handempty` tells me I can grasp `v8`. The initial plan forms; move the base, pick the object, and place it.
           
           However, I see an issue with moving the base: the `move_base` action removes `canmove` and the next action, `pick`, would require `canmove`. Now, this is unusual, but a re-reading of these effects shows that `pick` and `place` don't require the `canmove()` to be set true, meaning I don't need to change `canmove` at all. This means my plan is valid.
           
           I am now ready to place the object `v8` on `v18`. I ensure all preconditions are met, including the safety assumptions.
           
           So, in summary, I am confident that the plan - move base, pick up `v8`, place `v8` on `v18` - will achieve my goal. The facts, axioms, and current state information all support the plan!
