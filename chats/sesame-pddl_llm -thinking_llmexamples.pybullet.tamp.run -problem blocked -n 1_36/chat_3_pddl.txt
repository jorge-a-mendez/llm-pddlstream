           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Path to New Axiom**
           
           My task is to create a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()` within the `pr2-tamp` domain. It's quickly apparent that `new-axiom@0()` boils down to ensuring a specific object (let's call it `v12`, identified via the axiom's requirement of a type of `v17`) is `on` another object (`v18`).  This means I need to position `v12` such that it is both supported by and at a specific pose on `v18`.
           
           Analyzing the initial state, `v12` is currently `on` `v14` (supported at `v13`). My plan must move `v12` from this current location to `v18`.
           
           Here's my calculated approach:
           
           1.  **Move the Base:** Begin by moving the robot's base to a suitable configuration for grasping. This is achieved through `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`. The `canmove` predicate acts as a mutex, I have to be sure it's true when needed.
           
           2.  **Pick Up Object:** With the base in the right spot, I'll use `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)` to grab `v12` from its current pose `v13`.
           
           3.  **Place Object:** Finally, the goal is achieved through `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`, where I position `v12` onto `v18` at a suitable pose.
           
           This plan hinges on the proper execution and preconditions of each action. These preconditions should be meticulously verified. I have checked for required kinemtaic information for both `pick` and `place` actions, the base configuration as well as `canmove()` predicate being set to the proper values. Additionally I assumed the absence of unsafe preconditions, which is the standard procedure.
           
           The plan appears valid. All of the actions lead to `on(v12, v18)` becoming true, in addition to `type(v12, v17)` already being true from the initial state, thereby satisfying `new-axiom@0()`.
