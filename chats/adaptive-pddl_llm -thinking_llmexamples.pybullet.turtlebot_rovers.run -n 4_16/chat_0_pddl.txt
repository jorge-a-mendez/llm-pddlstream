           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Right, let's dissect this. We're aiming for `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunctive goal with a few key parts: getting images of some objectives, receiving analyses of specific rock and soil types, and some basic 'atconf' and 'free' conditions, which we see are already satisfied in the initial state. The plan requires the rovers, v12 and v14, to achieve both *image* and *analysis* goals.
           
           The image component relies on actions like `send_image`, which in turn needs `take_image` and `calibrate`. The analysis side demands `send_analysis` that depends on the `sample_rock` action. But here's the rub - the *only* actions we're allowed to use are `move` and `drop_rock`. 
           
           **Critical Constraint: Restricted Action Set**
           
           This is the central problem. We're explicitly *not* allowed to use the crucial actions needed to satisfy the goal. No `calibrate`, no `take_image`, no `send_image`, no `sample_rock`, and no `send_analysis`. These actions are necessary to update the facts to `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`. This immediately flags the goal as potentially *unreachable*.
           
           **Initial State Analysis and Implications**
           
           We know both rovers are initially 'atconf', at their respective configurations: v12 at v13 and v14 at v15. They're also 'free', meaning they're not holding any rocks. They have the line-of-sight and communication capabilities. It's a nicely set-up scene, but the goal remains elusive given our restricted actions.
           
           **Infeasibility of Actions within Allowed Set**
           
           Let's go through the permissible actions and their impacts:
           
           *   `move`: These actions only allow the rovers to stay put. v12 is stuck in v13, and v14 is stuck in v15. This confirms that it's impossible to manipulate any 'atconf' conditions to facilitate any image-capturing actions (e.g. to reach `#o3`).
           *   `drop_rock`: This action needs a rover to be 'full' of a rock. However, the rovers are currently "free," indicating that this action can't be executed in the initial state.
           
           Since no action changes relevant facts to make the required `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` conditions true, and the "drop rock" precondition is unachievable, the goal is *unreachable*. I'm sure of it.
