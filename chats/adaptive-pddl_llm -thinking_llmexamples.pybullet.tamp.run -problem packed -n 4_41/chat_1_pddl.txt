           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unachievable Goal State Due to Action Restrictions**
           
           Okay, so I've got a problem. My goal is clear: get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto `v18`.  It seems like I need to move each of these from their current location, supported by `v11`, to a pose `#o2` on `v18`.  The information I have suggests `#o2` is a feasible pose, as it's a known `supported` location on `v18`.
           
           My initial thought was straightforward: use the `pick` and `place` actions, which I'm familiar with.  The initial state provides all the necessary `kin` facts - the robot's arm, the grasps, the trajectories... everything I'd need to pick up and place the objects.  The robot arm `v4` is `handempty` and I know the `kin` facts. I know I have to plan by combining `pick` and `place` actions for each of the objects to get them to the desired poses, and the general pattern seems obvious.
           
           However, I've hit a snag.  The instructions are very specific: "You are only allowed to use the provided actions. Here is a list of valid action instances (applications of actions to specific objects). Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           And the *only* action instance provided is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This means my robot cannot actually change *any* object's pose. I need `pick` and `place`, but those aren't provided.  This creates a fundamental issue:  the robot's base can move *but that is it*. It simply won't be able to achieve the desired state using the provided restricted actions.
           
           I know I can't assume that I should fill in some continuous parameters or use some different plan. The explicit statement about "allowed actions" is clear and unequivocal.
           
           Therefore, despite having a well-defined goal and the knowledge to achieve it, the problem, as it stands, is unsolvable. I can't manipulate the objects to satisfy the `on` predicates with the given actions.  My only conclusion is that the goal state is currently unreachable given the constraints.
