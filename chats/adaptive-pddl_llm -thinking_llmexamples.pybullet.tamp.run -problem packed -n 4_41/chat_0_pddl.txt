           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Generation Analysis: Unreachable Goal Due to Action Restrictions**
           
           Okay, so the task is to get objects v8, v12, v14, and v16 onto v18. Initially, they're all on v11.  The PDDL representation lays out the initial state, the goal, and some actions: pick, place, move_base, clean, and cook.  Initially, it seemed like a straightforward pick-and-place problem. I would have needed to move the robot's arm, pick each object from its current location on v11, and place it on v18.  The problem description is also given.
           
           Initially I was thinking I would take the object v8 from v9 and move it to #o2, using arm v4, with v4 being handempty.  I would also consider a kinematic constraint to execute the pick-and-place procedure.
           
           However, the critical constraint is that I'm *only* allowed to use the specific action instance `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. The prompt makes it very clear that I can *only* use this exact action, and *no* other action. This is my only tool.
           
           The PDDL description states that I need a pick, place, clean, and cook, but I can't use them. This is because I am only given the application of `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. That particular instance.
           
           Therefore, since the goal requires moving objects, and the available action cannot change the location of objects, this goal cannot be achieved. The problem is fundamentally unsolvable given the restricted action set. The goal is unreachable.
