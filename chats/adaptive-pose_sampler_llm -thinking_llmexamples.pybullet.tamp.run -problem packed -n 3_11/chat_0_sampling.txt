(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object ID 5**
           
           Okay, I've got the task laid out. I need to generate 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5, dimensions 0.07715 x 0.07715) on a square surface (surface 0) that spans from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  Since this is a square object, its bounding box dimensions are constant regardless of its rotation.
           
           First, I need to determine the valid placement area on the surface.  The object's half-side length is 0.038575.  Therefore, to keep the object *entirely* within the surface, the object's center point (x, y) must satisfy: -0.135 + 0.038575 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.038575 and the same for y.  This gives me a valid range for both x and y of [-0.096425, 0.096425].
           
           To get 50 placements, I'll generate a grid.  I decided on a 7x7 grid, which gives me 49 placements. To ensure a good distribution and cover the valid range, I'll calculate the step size for the grid which is  `0.19285 / 6 = 0.032141666...`. Rounded the step size to 0.032141.  Using this step, I calculated the following grid: x =  [-0.096425, -0.064283, -0.032142, 0.000000, 0.032142, 0.064283, 0.096425] and the y array is the same. The x and y values are well within the computed limits. For each coordinate pair in this grid, I will apply a theta value of 0. For the final (50th) placement, I will choose the center of the surface `(0, 0)` with a rotation of `pi/4` just to prove the system can handle rotation and for diversity. This should provide a good spread of placements while making sure they are within the surface bounds. Since there aren't any other objects placed yet, collision avoidance isn't a factor this time, but I'll need to keep that in mind for future placements.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement on Surface 0: Avoiding Collision with Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback that object ID 5 has been successfully placed at `(0, 0.0, -0.096425, -0.096425)`. Now, my next task is to position object ID 4, a square with a side length of approximately 0.080257, onto surface 0.  I know surface 0 has the bounds `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           First, I need to figure out the possible placement region for object 4 on surface 0, assuming no other objects.  By taking half the side length of object 4, which is 0.0401285, I calculated that the center of object 4 can move within a range of `[-0.09487140636208468, 0.09487140636208468]` on both x and y.
           
           However, object 5 is already in place. It's also a square, with a side length of 0.07715084947271544, and it's located with its center at (-0.096425, -0.096425).  This means I need to calculate the AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) of object 5, which comes out to be roughly  `[(-0.135, -0.135), (-0.05785, -0.05785)]`. Effectively, it is located in the bottom-left corner and nearly touching the surface.
           
           I need to make sure I don't create an overlap between object 4 and object 5. So, I need the center of object 4 (`c4`) to be a certain distance away from the center of object 5, based on their AABB. Using my collision knowledge, I then derived that collision occurs if the following four conditions are all true:
           `(c4_x + h4 > c5_x - h5)` AND `(c5_x + h5 > c4_x - h4)` AND
           `(c4_y + h4 > c5_y - h5)` AND `(c5_y + h5 > c4_y - h4)`
           
           Using those conditions, I can conclude that object 4 needs to be placed at a location such that the x position is greater than -0.01772098162572696 or the y position is greater than -0.01772098162572696.
           
           I'm going to set up a 10x10 grid of potential placement locations across the valid area of surface 0. I calculated a spacing using the bounds of the surface, calculating a value `step = 0.021082534750184596`. Then I will step through these placement points, and, for all placements which are both less than the coordinates described in `c_crit`, they are colliding, so skip those.
           
           I'm going to alternate between zero rotation and a rotation of pi/4 radians (0.785398) to provide some diversity.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out where to place object 6 (size: 0.0747x0.0747) stably on surface 0, making sure I avoid collisions with the existing objects 5 and 4. I'll make this work.
           
           First, I define the relevant surface and object geometries. Surface 0 is a square from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). I've got the bounding box and half-side length (`h5` and `h4`) for both object 5 and 4 and I calculate their AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) so I can figure out where it's safe for 6.
           
           To start, my valid area for object 6 is a square centered on (0,0) and side length: 0.1952. My safe placement area is calculated by making sure that the object can't intersect with the bounding box from (x,y) to (x+h6, y+h6).
           
           Then, the critical task is to calculate the collision avoidance zones. I carefully define the conditions for object 6 not colliding with either object 5 or 4. Using the object 6 AABB and the existing objects' AABB, I derive the conditions where a placement (x,y) would cause a collision.
           
           I can make this easier by working with AABBs, so I have the formulas: `x + h6 <= x5_min` or `x5_max <= x - h6` or `y + h6 <= y5_min` or `y5_max <= y - h6`. After simplification and rounding for my human eyes, I arrive at `x >= -0.02048 or y >= -0.02048` for object 5 and another `x <= -0.08804 or x >= 0.06696 or y >= -0.01737` for object 4. Then, I put all the calculations together.
           
           Using those collision conditions, I construct the placement rules. To define a *safe* location, I combine the collision constraints, placing 6 within the bounds of surface 0 and outside the areas occupied by either existing object.
           
           After that, I've got a system to test candidate placements and make the determination. I'll test all the x-y coordinates on a 10x10 grid to confirm. If my math is correct, I expect to place 50 stable instances of object 6. With a valid placement in place, I also take into account rotation with a diversity metric of 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees. This provides even more points, so there is no shortage of locations.
           
           The results are positive. Using the test grid I have 76 possible placements, so I can simply take the first 50.
