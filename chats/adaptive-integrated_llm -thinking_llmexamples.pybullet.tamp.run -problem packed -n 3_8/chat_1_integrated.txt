User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.003, 0.424), (0.093, 0.52)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.055, -0.519), (0.04, -0.425)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.121, -0.322), (0.2, -0.242)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.045, 0.472, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.965, 0.263).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.007, -0.472, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.972, -0.235).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.16, -0.282, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.072, 0.997).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Plan Formulation for Object Relocation**
           
           My primary goal is to devise a plan that allows the robot to move three distinct objects (v8, v12, and v14) from their initial location on surface v11 to a target surface, v16.  I have two robot arms, v4 and v6.  The given initial state indicates the robot is able to move and that each object is graspable.
           
           Crucially, the PDDL description provides 'kin' relations defined for arm v4 specifically, specifying valid pick and place poses and grasps for each object. All of this information is available for one of the arms.  All three objects can be supported by both v10 and v16.  The pick and place operations require a certain base configuration and an arm trajectory (#o4), and all initial states are consistent with base configuration v3 and all the pick/place trajectories. However, no base move operations are explicitly defined.
           
           I've determined that achieving the desired goal state (all objects on v16) translates into achieving the supported predicate and the 'atpose' predicates for each object relative to surface v16.
           
           From the initial state description, I recognize that the objects are currently situated on surface v11.  The necessary actions, therefore, will involve picking each object up from its current pose and placing it onto surface v16 at a new target pose.  The actions are only for arm v4.
           
           Considering the preconditions of `pick` and `place` actions, I see that the only usable arm is v4, and, at the moment, it is handempty and in its starting configuration.  The initial state contains the `kin` relations to allow for these actions.
           Regarding the base configuration, all 'kin' predicates require the base to be at configuration v3 for the operations. Since only v3 is available as a move base configuration, and I am assuming that the base does not need to move from the initially given configuration, the solution involves only a sequence of pick and place operations.
           Assuming that the robot's base configuration doesn't need to change.
           Now, the key to the plan lies in defining collision-free placement locations for these objects on the target surface, v16. I must choose new pose values for the placed objects such that their placements are stable and collision-free. The PDDL problem states that if the symbolic target pose `#o2` is the same for several objects, the placement locations of each should have distinct values.  The poses provided in the plan must satisfy the `supported` predicate on v16, and must be different.  I will choose placement pose values (`#o2`) for each object on the target surface v16, taking into consideration their initial bounding box data and creating a configuration that would allow all three objects to be placed.  
           
           Having analyzed the bounding box information for the objects and target surface, I will place the objects in a triangular pattern to fit within the constraints of the surface dimensions. All objects will be at the same height, and the plan uses the arm v4 for pick/place operations only.
           Given the initial positions:
           `v8`: `(0.045, 0.472, 0.781)`
           `v12`: `(0.16, -0.282, 0.781)`
           `v14`: `(-0.007, -0.472, 0.781)`
           
           The proposed placement positions (in x, y, z format) on v16:
           `v8`: (-0.06, -0.06, 0.781)
           `v12`: (0.06, -0.06, 0.781)
           `v14`: (0, 0.06, 0.781)
           
           The plan then involves a straightforward sequence of pick-and-place actions:
           
           1.  Pick v8 (using arm v4) from its current location, and then place it at its specified target location.
           2.  Repeat for v12 and then v14.
           
           Therefore, the finalized plan is composed of these pick-and-place actions for each object, using the `v4` arm to complete the task.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Plan Infeasibility**
           
           Okay, so I've looked at the user's critique and I agree - the previous plan is a non-starter. The key issue is the restricted action space. The only valid action instance is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`, which is essentially a no-op. The robot can move its base from `v3` to `v3` using `btraj #o0`. That's it.
           
           My goal is to achieve `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`. Initially, I have `on(v8, v11)`, `on(v12, v11)`, and `on(v14, v11)`. The plan requires me to move those objects from `v11` to `v16`. To achieve that, I need to use `pick` and `place` actions to move the objects.
           
           However, the action space is limited. I only have `move_base`. There are *no* `pick` or `place` actions available. This immediately flags a serious problem: I cannot manipulate the objects in the way necessary to satisfy the goal. Given this constraint, I'm forced to conclude that the provided goal is unattainable with the actions granted. It's a fundamental mismatch between the required actions and the permitted ones.
