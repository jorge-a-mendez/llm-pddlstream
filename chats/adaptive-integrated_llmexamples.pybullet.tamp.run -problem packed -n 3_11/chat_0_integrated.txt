           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.085, 0.477), (0.003, 0.564)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.244, -0.255, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.18, 0.984).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.16, -0.42), (0.259, -0.321)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.289, -0.3), (-0.199, -0.209)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.21, -0.371, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.38, 0.925).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.041, 0.521, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.595, 0.804).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom stackable(v14, v10)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom stackable(v14, v16)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom atpose(v14, v15)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom supported(v14, v15, v11)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The task is to place three objects, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, onto the surface `v16`. Currently, `v8` is on `v11` at pose `v9`, `v12` is on `v11` at pose `v13`, and `v14` is on `v11` at pose `v15`. Since no pick/place actions are available, and the `move_base` action does not change the `on` predicate, the goal is unreachable. No actions can be taken that would change the `on` predicate.
