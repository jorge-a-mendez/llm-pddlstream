User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.085, 0.477), (0.003, 0.564)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.289, -0.3), (-0.199, -0.209)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.041, 0.521, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.595, 0.804).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.16, -0.42), (0.259, -0.321)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.21, -0.371, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.38, 0.925).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.244, -0.255, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.18, 0.984).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains several objects: v8, v12, and v14 are graspable and can be stacked on v10 or v16. v11 represents the table surface. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, currently at configurations v5 and v7 respectively. The robot base is at v3.
           The goal is to place all three objects (v8, v12, v14) on v16.
           Currently, v8 is on v11 at pose v9. v12 is on v11 at pose v13. v14 is on v11 at pose v15.
           The robot can pick up objects with arm v4. It can move its base, but the only move_base action available is moving from v3 to v3 (no actual movement).
           
           Since the goal is to place v8, v12, and v14 on v16, we need to pick them from their current locations on v11 and place them on v16. The robot arm v4 has the kinematics to interact with v8, v12, and v14 at their current poses and at the target pose #o2 on v16.
           
           We can solve this problem by picking each object and then placing it on the target surface v16 at a collision-free pose. Since all objects can be placed at #o2, we will use three different continuous values for #o2, one for each object to ensure they don't collide.
           
           The available action instances only include a `move_base` action that doesn't change the base configuration (v3 to v3). This means the robot cannot move its base to a more advantageous position if the current base configuration is insufficient for all pick and place operations. However, the `kin` predicates indicate that arm `v4` at base configuration `#o3` can reach all initial poses (v9, v13, v15) and the target pose `#o2`. The initial state also indicates that `#o3` is a `bconf`, but it's not explicitly stated that `atbconf(#o3)` is true. However, `atbconf(v3)` is true, and the `kin` actions all refer to `#o3`, which must be the same as `v3` for the plan to be valid because there are no base movements that can change from `v3` to `#o3`. Thus, we assume `#o3` is `v3`.
           
           The plan will be:
           1. Pick v8 from v9.
           2. Place v8 on v16 at #o2.
           3. Pick v12 from v13.
           4. Place v12 on v16 at #o2.
           5. Pick v14 from v15.
           6. Place v14 on v16 at #o2.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The provided list of valid actions only includes `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This action does not allow for picking or placing any objects. Therefore, it is impossible to achieve the goal of moving objects v8, v12, and v14 onto v16, as this requires `pick` and `place` actions which are not in the valid actions list. The goal is unreachable with the given valid actions.
