           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Here's how I'm thinking about this:**
           
           Okay, I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0. The object is a square (0.07 x 0.07), and surface 0 is a rectangle with bounds (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0).  A stable placement means the object must fit entirely within the surface's boundaries. Since it's a square, rotation is important to consider. I need to handle cases where the object is unrotated (theta = 0, or multiples of pi), and also, where the object is rotated (theta = pi/4 or multiples thereof).
           
           First, let's nail down the geometry. Surface 0 is 0.6 units wide and 0.6 units high.  The square object has sides of 0.07 units. To ensure the object is fully contained, I'll calculate the valid center point ranges for the object based on its effective size and rotation.
           
           For the unrotated square (theta = 0), I know I need to shift the object's position back from the edges of the surface by half of its side length (0.035). This leads to a valid center x range of 4.235 to 4.765 and a y range of -0.565 to -0.035. I can generate a grid of positions with these ranges for a significant number of stable placements.
           
           The tricky part is accounting for rotation. Since the problem explicitly mentions the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB), I can't just use the 0.07 x 0.07 dimensions directly if the object is rotated away from axis alignment.  A fully rotated square will have a larger bounding box, and so its center must be constrained by that AABB, not the dimensions of the original bounding box.
           
           Let's assume the square can rotate to any angle, the largest bounding box occurs when the square is at 45 degree increments. Because all angles can be valid, I will generate a number of points such that half of them occur along an x/y axis and the other half occur along a diagonal angle.
           
           So, I will generate 5x5 = 25 placements at 0 degrees and 5x5 = 25 placements at 45 degrees.

(Thoughts: **Thoughts on Generating Safe Placements for Object ID 10**
           
           Okay, I've got a new challenge: find 50 stable placements for object ID 10 on surface 0, making sure it doesn't collide with the existing object ID 5.  Here's my thought process:
           
           First, I looked at the feedback on the successful placements for object ID 5. They're all on surface 0, and they're all oriented at `theta = 0`.  This gives me a good starting point. Object 10 is almost a square, which simplifies things.  I know surface 0 has a valid region of `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.
           
           Since I need to place object 10 without collisions, I need to know *where* object 5 already is. I've got a list of the *successful* placements for object 5, and their bounding boxes (AABBs). I can compute the AABBs for Object 5 based on the successful center locations given.
           
           The key to avoiding collisions is identifying "safe" zones for object 10, i.e., areas where its bounding box won't overlap with object 5's bounding boxes. I've broken this down into two steps:
           1.  **Define the valid placement region:** I need to make sure the center of object 10 can be placed within the rectangle surface area minus the object itself's bounding-box dimensions, depending on the object's orientation (`theta`).
           2.  **Avoid overlap:** For any given location, determine if the placement would cause a collision with Object 5.
           
           For a non-rotated object (theta = 0), this is straightforward: just make sure that the object's center is sufficiently far from the edge of the surface (the edge condition) and from the center of each object 5. The effective object size will be the size of the box itself.
           If the object is rotated (theta = pi/4, say), the bounding box will change (it will enlarge), so I need to account for it when determining collision regions. The "effective width" will increase.
           
           So, I calculated the permissible ranges for the object's center coordinates based on its size and how it's oriented.
           
           I then identified the problematic regions (overlapping regions) to avoid these overlaps.
           
           Now, I'll generate the actual placements:
           
           1.  I'll place 25 non-rotated (theta = 0) object 10 objects, ensuring that the y coordinate is outside the range that could collide with object 5.
           2.  I'll then place 25 rotated (theta = pi/4) objects, again making sure to pick coordinates that avoid collisions.
           
           The logic is sound. All generated coordinates are confirmed to work. This should give a good spread of placements without collisions.
