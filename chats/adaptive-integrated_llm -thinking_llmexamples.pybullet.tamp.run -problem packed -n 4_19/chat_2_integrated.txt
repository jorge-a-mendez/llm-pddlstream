User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.141, 0.285), (0.236, 0.381)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.056, 0.306), (0.035, 0.396)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.185, 0.444), (-0.112, 0.518)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.011, 0.351, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.984, -0.181).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.056, -0.464), (0.038, -0.37)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.189, 0.333, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.866, 0.5).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.149, 0.481, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.689, 0.725).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.009, -0.417, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.974, -0.227).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Alright, here's my breakdown of the best way to move these objects.** The goal is clear: I need to get four objects – v8, v12, v14, and v16 – from their current locations on surface v11 onto the smaller surface v18.  I've got a robot with two arms, but only one is being used, v4.  Both hands are empty to start, which is good. I need to use 'pick' and 'place' actions to execute the task.
           
           Looking at the problem, I can see that all the objects are currently resting on the large surface, v11.  The problem gives us poses such as v9, v13, v15, and v17, and also points out that the objects are being *supported* by a given surface. The goal state asks for the objects to be *on* surface v18, by setting `atpose(o, #o2)` and `supported(o, #o2, v18)`.
           
           The crucial thing is realizing that I'll need a way to differentiate the poses on the target surface, v18. I will have to define a different, continuous value for `#o2` for each object. The key facts, like `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`, tell me that this `#o2` is a placeholder for a pose *on* v18.
           
           Here's the plan in a nutshell:
           
           1.  **Move the base to the pick/place position:** The initial base is v3, but the provided actions use base configuration `#o3`. I'll first need a `move_base` action to get the robot base to the right spot, presumably `#o3`, for the pick and place actions, and move back if it's necessary.
           2.  **Pick and place each object:**  I'll pick up each object individually from its initial position on v11 using arm v4, base config #o3, grasp #o1, and the correct arm trajectory #o4. Then I'll place each one on v18, at the pre-defined `#o2` position.
           3.  **Move the base back (if necessary):** if the initial state and the end state don't match, or the cost is impacted, I need to bring the base back.
           
           Now, let's nail down the specifics:
           
           *   **Posing**: I need to define the positions for v8, v12, v14, and v16 on v18. Based on the AABB information, I need to place objects in a 2x2 grid. I used the center of the surface v18, and offset each object to prevent any collisions. I am setting the "z" coordinate of the target poses to `0.781` based on the surface v11 (or `v9`, `v13`, etc.) that the objects currently rest on and the problem constraints. I will ensure they are fully inside the bounds of the surface v18, so the placed objects don't slide off.
           *   **Action details:** The actions are `pick` and `place` in the problem. The robot arm v4 uses grasp #o1 and base #o3, trajectory #o4.
           *   **Cost**:  I will keep base movements to a minimum because I need to make sure I am minimizing the overall cost. I am assuming a 1-unit cost for each pick and place action. The `move_base` cost will be the distance between `v3` and `#o3` or the reverse. I have confirmed that for the plan to work, base is moved from `v3` to `#o3`.
           * **Predicates:** I need to make sure the preconditions for all actions are met and effects make sense. I also have to ensure the objects have `canmove()` predicate between `move_base` and `pick/place` operations. I am assuming other `unsafe` conditions are false and can be used for plan execution.
           *   **Quaternion**: The initial states use `(0, 0, 0.984, -0.181)` for orientation, but I can assume no rotation `(0,0,0,1)` for poses `#o2` unless stability or another aspect requires a specific angle.
           
           In short, it's all about strategic use of `#o2` poses on `v18` and keeping that base moving to a minimum to keep things efficient, and ensuring I am using the right values.
