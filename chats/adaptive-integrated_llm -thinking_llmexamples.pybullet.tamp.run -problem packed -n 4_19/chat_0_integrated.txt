User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.141, 0.285), (0.236, 0.381)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.056, 0.306), (0.035, 0.396)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.185, 0.444), (-0.112, 0.518)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.011, 0.351, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.984, -0.181).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.056, -0.464), (0.038, -0.37)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.189, 0.333, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.866, 0.5).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.149, 0.481, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.689, 0.725).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.009, -0.417, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.974, -0.227).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal that seems straightforward on the surface: get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` all onto `v18`.  My initial analysis is to decompose this into four subgoals, each involving picking an object from its current location (`v9`, `v13`, `v15`, and `v17` respectively) and placing it on `v18`. The poses on `v18` are represented by `#o2`, and I realize I'll need to specify unique continuous values for each object to ensure they have distinct stable poses.
           
           I then delve into the initial conditions, noting the locations and supporting surfaces of the objects. I also consider the dimensions (AABBs) to ensure there are no collisions.
           
           However, a critical constraint emerges: the list of available actions only includes a `move_base` action, and it doesn't even change the base configuration. This is where the red flag goes up. The *core* of this task – picking and placing objects – is missing! I'm tasked with changing the `atpose` predicate of the objects. Currently, `v8` is `atpose(v8, v9)` supported by `v11`. To satisfy the goal, I need the robot to perform two things: first, pick up the objects, and second, place them on `v18`. These actions are implied by the goal, but they're not provided in the allowed action set.
           
           Since there's no `pick` or `place` action available, the only thing I can do is move the base, which is useless because it doesn't change the object's positions. Therefore, the goal is *unachievable* within the given constraints. I must conclude that I cannot create a valid plan.
