User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.141, 0.285), (0.236, 0.381)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.056, 0.306), (0.035, 0.396)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.185, 0.444), (-0.112, 0.518)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.011, 0.351, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.984, -0.181).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.056, -0.464), (0.038, -0.37)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.189, 0.333, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.866, 0.5).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.149, 0.481, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.689, 0.725).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.009, -0.417, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.974, -0.227).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Planning Process: A Detailed Analysis**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of my thinking to solve this problem. I need to move four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) onto a surface called v18. The current state is straightforward: each object is on a different supporting surface (v11). My goal is to get each one onto v18.
           
           This screams a sequential plan: pick up, move, and place each object.  The key is to use the `pick` and `place` actions.  I need to ensure that the arm (v4) is empty and that it's in the correct base configuration (v3).  I'm provided `kin` predicates, which link the arm, object poses, grasps, and base/trajectory configurations.
           
           The initial poses have to have compatible positions that allow for the pick action. I need to figure out where on v18 I'm going to put these objects.  Luckily, the provided pose information gives me clues. Since the initial state says that v18 can support all four objects, I can build an appropriate plan. Since I must use the existing `#o2` symbol, I'll need to create four separate "#o2" symbols, for each object, to satisfy all requirements.
           
           Let's use a 2x2 grid on v18.  That way, they can all fit, and are safely distributed.  I'll place object v8 at the top-right, v12 at the top-left, v14 at the bottom-left, and v16 at the bottom-right.  Based on the size of v18 and the initial pose information, I'll place these poses such that the Z level of all is 0.781. This ensures that the objects are all "supported". The positions are easy to calculate: `(0.06, 0.06)`, `(-0.06, 0.06)`, `(-0.06, -0.06)`, and `(0.06, -0.06)`.
           
           Now, the collision checks. I have to make sure that the robot's arm can reach the objects without any collisions. The objects are initially separated, so no collisions there.  When I'm moving the objects, I'm going to place each object one by one, ensuring that there aren't collisions between the arm and other objects. Since I'm using a common base configuration, and I'm placing objects at a reasonable distance, I can assume that collision isn't an issue.
           
           Each of the four objects goes through this sequence:
           1.  **Pick:** Get the arm to grasp the object from its initial pose.
           2.  **Place:** Move the arm to the target location on v18 and place the object.
           The important details are that I will need to ensure that I instantiate a different `#o2` for each object, even though all four are supported by v18. Now I can build my plan, step-by-step.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a new plan, and the user, bless their heart, immediately pointed out a major flaw – it's using actions that aren't actually valid. The only action the system *says* is okay is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  That's just the robot moving to the same spot, which is utterly useless for achieving the goal.
           
           The goal itself is clear: get objects v8, v12, v14, and v16 all placed on surface v18.  That screams "pick and place" actions to me. But here's the kicker: the only allowed action is movement, and the plan needs to pick up objects and put them down.
           
           I see a fundamental disconnect.  I can't pick up, I can't put down, and I can't, therefore, fulfill the *on* goal condition.  Given the constraints, this goal is completely unachievable. There's no way to reach v8, v12, v14, or v16 to place them on v18. We're at an impasse. We need valid `pick` and `place` actions; otherwise, we're stuck in a loop of movement with no progress.
