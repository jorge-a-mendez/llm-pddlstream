           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal is Unachievable**
           
           My primary goal is to determine a plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. Examining the axiom's definition, I identify the critical subgoals: `receivedimage` (for objectives v17, v18, v19, v20) and `receivedanalysis` (for both stone and soil samples). I know that I need to determine the required sequence of actions in order to accomplish those goals. The initial state already satisfies the remaining conditions.
           
           My first thought process is that to generate `receivedimage`, I'll use the  `send_image` action and to generate `receivedanalysis`, I'll use the `send_analysis` action. I started to check the preconditions and that's when I had to take a step back and examine the allowed actions because I was working toward what I knew needed to be done but the actual actions I could perform were extremely limited.
           
           The allowed actions are only  `move(v12, v13, #o2, v13)`, `move(v14, v15, #o2, v15)`, `drop_rock(v12, v16)`, and `drop_rock(v14, v16)`.  The problem is, neither of those actions can produce `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`. I'm starting to worry!
           
           Upon further inspection, the `move` actions appear to be no-ops: they simply move rovers to their current locations, not affecting the state.  The `drop_rock` actions have preconditions that are false in the initial state. Since the initial state provides free stores, there's nothing to drop.
           
           So, with these constraints, it becomes clear that there is no valid plan. Because I am restricted from using actions necessary to achieve the core subgoals, it is unachievable!
           
           My final conclusion is that, because the allowed action set does *not* include the actions needed to achieve `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`, it is impossible to achieve the overall goal of `new-axiom@0()` given the specified constraints.
