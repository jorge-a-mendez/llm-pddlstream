User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.065, -0.354), (0.156, -0.264)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.202, 0.483), (0.287, 0.568)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.111, -0.309, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.826, 0.563).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.267, -0.246), (-0.168, -0.147)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.244, 0.525, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.788, 0.615).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.218, -0.197, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.387, 0.922).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable objects: v8, v12, and v14. They are currently at poses v9, v13, and v15 respectively, all supported by v11 (a large surface). The goal is to place all three objects on v16 (a smaller surface). There are two arms, v4 and v6, but only v4 has kin information that is relevant to the problem. Arm v6 is ataconf v7 and arm v4 is ataconf v5. Both arms are handempty. The robot is at base configuration v3 and can move.
           
           The plan involves moving each object from its initial position on v11 to a new position on v16 using the pick and place actions. Since the goal requires placing all three objects on v16, and there is only one available pose #o2 for objects on v16, it is necessary to assign different continuous values for #o2 for each object to ensure they don't collide.
           
           The `move_base` action is available, but the start and end base configurations are the same (v3), meaning there's no actual base movement. This is fine as the `kin` predicates already account for the robot's reach.
           
           The plan will proceed as follows:
           1. Pick v8 from v9.
           2. Place v8 at #o2 (on v16).
           3. Pick v12 from v13.
           4. Place v12 at #o2 (on v16).
           5. Pick v14 from v15.
           6. Place v14 at #o2 (on v16).
           
           Since multiple objects are to be placed on v16 using the same symbolic pose `#o2`, it's critical to provide distinct continuous values for each object on v16. v16 has an AABB of ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           v8 has an AABB of ((0.065, -0.354), (0.156, -0.264)). This is larger than v16, so cannot be placed on it. This means the goal is unreachable.
           
           Wait, I need to check the exact AABB for the objects.
           v8: ((0.065, -0.354), (0.156, -0.264)) This is the object's relative AABB. The problem formulation implies that the pose parameters are global coordinates. So the AABB for v8 is ((0.065, -0.354), (0.156, -0.264)) when the object's local origin is at (0,0,0). I need to place it on v16, which has an AABB of ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           Let's assume the poses are for the center of the object.
           For v8 (width = 0.091, height = 0.09):
             x range: [-0.135 + 0.091/2, 0.135 - 0.091/2] = [-0.09, 0.09]
             y range: [-0.135 + 0.09/2, 0.135 - 0.09/2] = [-0.09, 0.09]
           For v12 (width = 0.099, height = 0.099):
             x range: [-0.135 + 0.099/2, 0.135 - 0.099/2] = [-0.0855, 0.0855]
             y range: [-0.135 + 0.099/2, 0.135 - 0.099/2] = [-0.0855, 0.0855]
           For v14 (width = 0.085, height = 0.085):
             x range: [-0.135 + 0.085/2, 0.135 - 0.085/2] = [-0.0925, 0.0925]
             y range: [-0.135 + 0.085/2, 0.135 - 0.085/2] = [-0.0925, 0.0925]
           
           All objects can fit on v16. I will calculate three distinct poses for #o2 on v16. Since no z-height for v16 is given, I will assume a default table height for the objects of 0.781 and place objects on top of it. I will place the objects in a row on v16 with a slight offset.
           
           Let's assume v16 is centered at (0,0) and its top surface is at z=0.781.
           For v8 on v16:
             Let's choose x = -0.05, y = 0, z = 0.781, theta = 0
           For v12 on v16:
             Let's choose x = 0.0, y = 0, z = 0.781, theta = 0
           For v14 on v16:
             Let's choose x = 0.05, y = 0, z = 0.781, theta = 0

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 v16 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 v16 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 v16 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not change the state of any objects or help in achieving the goal of placing objects on `v16`. Specifically, it does not involve any `pick` or `place` operations, which are necessary to move objects. Therefore, the goal is unreachable with the given set of valid actions.
