           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.218, -0.197, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.387, 0.922).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.111, -0.309, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.826, 0.563).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.267, -0.246), (-0.168, -0.147)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.065, -0.354), (0.156, -0.264)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.244, 0.525, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.788, 0.615).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.202, 0.483), (0.287, 0.568)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable objects: v8, v12, and v14. They are currently placed on the surface v11. The goal is to stack all three objects (v8, v12, and v14) on the surface v16. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, both currently empty. The robot's base is at configuration v3. There are also several continuous parameters that are yet to be computed, such as poses and grasps. The only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action doesn't change the base configuration, but it does consume the `canmove()` predicate. This suggests that the real work will be done by pick and place actions, and the `move_base` action is just a way to reset the `canmove()` predicate. Since the robot doesn't need to move its base to reach any of the objects, we can ignore the `move_base` action for now and assume the robot's base will remain at v3.
           
           To achieve the goal, we need to pick up each of the objects (v8, v12, v14) from their current locations on v11 and place them on v16. We will need to compute the `kin` and `atraj` parameters for each pick and place operation, and also the continuous values for the target poses of each object on v16. There are no poses without '#' that put the objects on v16, so we must use '#o2' for placing the objects.
           
           Let's plan to pick and place each object one by one.
           
           1. Pick v8 from v9 (on v11) using arm v6 and place it on v16 at #o2.
           2. Pick v12 from v13 (on v11) using arm v6 and place it on v16 at #o2.
           3. Pick v14 from v15 (on v11) using arm v6 and place it on v16 at #o2.
           
           Since all objects are stackable on v16, and there is a shared pose #o2 available for all, we will use that. We need to define three distinct poses for #o2, one for each object.
           
           --Plan--:
           (pick v6 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o0)
           (place v6 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o0)

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v6 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o0) , (place v6 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o0) , (pick v6 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o0) , (place v6 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o0) , (pick v6 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o0) , (place v6 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o0)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The given list of valid action instances only contains `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This action does not change the state of the objects or their locations, nor does it allow for picking or placing any objects. Therefore, with only this action available, it is impossible to achieve the goal of `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`. The goal is unreachable.
