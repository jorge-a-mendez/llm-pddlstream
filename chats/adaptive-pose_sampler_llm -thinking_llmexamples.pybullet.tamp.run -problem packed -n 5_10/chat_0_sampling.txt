(Thoughts: **Final Placement Strategy for Object 4 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to come up with 50 stable placements for object ID 4, a square with dimensions 0.0975, on surface 0, which is a square from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  Stability means the object is *fully* inside the surface bounds and doesn't collide with anything else (no existing obstacles or previously placed objects, at least for now).
           
           First, I calculated the available space on the surface.  The surface's dimensions are 0.27 x 0.27.  Since the object's dimensions are also square (0.0975), I need to figure out the valid range for the *center* of the object to ensure it stays fully inside. This turns out to be a smaller square with bounds of [-0.086247, 0.086247] for both x and y.
           
           To get diversity, I considered rotation (theta).  Because the object is square, the bounding box *doesn't* change with rotation. This means rotation doesn't directly affect stability in this specific case. However, it's good practice to vary it.
           
           I decided to create a grid-like distribution of placements, making sure they cover the valid area.  I figured a 5x5 grid (25 points) would be fine, so I calculated the step size for the x and y coordinates. It came out to 0.0431235.
           The resulting X and Y coordinates were:  [-0.086247, -0.0431235, 0.0, 0.0431235, 0.086247].
           
           For the first 25 placements, I'll use those x and y coordinates with theta = 0.  Then for the next 25 points I will iterate same x and y coordinates with theta = pi/2. This will ensure I cover the valid placement area and still respect our diversity constraints.  That gives me exactly the 50 placements that I needed and ensures a good and diverse coverage of placement space.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 7**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new task: place object ID 7 on Surface 0, avoiding a collision with the previously successfully placed object ID 4.  The good news is, I know that (0, 0.0, -0.086247, -0.086247) worked for object 4, which has to be kept in mind for collision avoidance.  Object 7 is square, roughly 0.0917 units on each side, just like Object 4.  Surface 0 is defined by the corners (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). I need to generate 50 stable, non-colliding placements for object 7.
           
           First, I calculated the valid range for the center coordinates of object 7, considering the surface dimensions.  The usable x and y ranges for object 7's center are roughly [-0.089148, 0.089148].
           
           Object 4 is positioned in the bottom-left corner of the surface with an AABB from [-0.135, -0.0375] x [-0.135, -0.0375]. Its center is about (-0.086, -0.086). Now, to avoid overlap, object 7 can't be in the bottom-left of the surface. So to avoid collisions, I need to constrain Object 7's placement *either* to the right of  0.0083522  OR above  0.0083522 . This means I'll position object 7 to the right or to the top.
           
           With the constraints in mind, I established a grid over the valid region for the center of object 7. I only considered a grid, however, that ensures that any of these two conditions will be true. After reviewing, a 5x5 grid with equal step sizes seemed to be sufficient for a diverse range, where all the values are relative to [-0.089148, 0.089148], so I got values as follows:  [-0.089148, -0.044574, 0.0, 0.044574, 0.089148].
           
           This generated a set of valid (x, y) coordinates for object 7 that avoid collision. There are 16 of them, where the x or y are larger than 0.0083522. To get the 50 spots, I'll then rotate the 16 by 0, pi/4, pi/2, and 3pi/4 and take the first 50. So the final list will be a set of 50 tuples: (surf_idx, theta, x, y) of non-colliding placements for object 7.

(Thoughts: **My Placement Strategy for Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 5) on Surface 0, avoiding collisions with existing objects (ID 4 and ID 7). First, I calculated the size of the object - it's roughly 0.0978 x 0.0978, which means the half-size is about 0.0489. The surface bounds are simple: -0.135 to 0.135 for both x and y.
           
           To avoid going off the surface, I defined the valid center area for the new object: -0.086088 to 0.086088 for both x and y. Then, I needed to figure out where I *couldn't* put it because of the existing objects.
           
           Object 4 has an AABB of [-0.135, -0.037494] x [-0.135, -0.037494] and Object 7 AABB is [-0.001278, 0.090426] x [-0.135, -0.043296].
           
           My collision check showed that for Object 5, I have two conditions I have to meet - to avoid 4, cx > 0.011418 OR cy > 0.011418, and to avoid 7, cx < -0.05019 OR cy > 0.005616.
           
           Since I have a 0.172176 x 0.07467 region to work with to satisfy the condition, I decided to focus on cy being greater than 0.011418, as this satisfies all conditions.
           I chose to build a 5x5 grid in the region where cy > 0.011418 using a step dx = 0.043044 and dy = 0.0186675, with values to make sure that no two locations are the same, and then rotated each one by `pi/2`.
           
           This gets me 50 collision-free placements within the surface boundaries, and I can now proceed.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing 50 instances of Object 8 (a square with dimensions roughly 0.07886 x 0.07886) onto Surface 0, which is bounded by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  I need to avoid collisions with objects 4, 7, and 5, which are already in place. First, I determined the valid region for Object 8's center on the surface, approximately `[-0.09557, 0.09557]` x `[-0.09557, 0.09557]`.
           
           Next, I analyzed the bounding boxes (AABBs) of the existing objects:
           *   **Object 4:** Located in the bottom-left.
           *   **Object 7:** Located in the bottom-middle.
           *   **Object 5:** Located in the middle-left.
           
           I defined the exclusion zones around each existing object, based on Object 8's half-size (h8 = 0.0394291).  These zones represent the areas where Object 8's center *cannot* be located to avoid collisions.  My analysis of these exclusion zones revealed that the most promising placement region is the top-right quadrant of the valid surface area.
           
           Specifically, I determined a safe region for Object 8's center: `x_center` in `[0.00225316, 0.0955708866]` and `y_center` in `[0.00193523, 0.0955708866]`. I computed 5 x and 5 y coordinates based on the valid region dimensions and generated a grid across the safe area, yielding 25 positions to put Object 8.
           
           Finally, since the square object's AABB remains unchanged with rotation, I'll apply two rotations for each coordinate pair (0 and pi/2), generating the required 50 placements.

(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for Object 6 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I need to find 50 stable placements for Object 6 on Surface 0, making sure it doesn't collide with objects 4, 7, 5, and 8 that are already placed. First, I calculated the valid range for Object 6's center `(xc, yc)` on Surface 0. Then, I defined the collision avoidance conditions by looking at the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) of the placed objects and determined the collision-free regions for Object 6's center.
           
           Object 6 is a square with a size of 0.08007818943468425. This means the object must fit within a `[-0.09496091, 0.09496091]` range for both `xc` and `yc`.
           
           I identified the exclusion zones (collision regions) for each existing object by calculating their AABBs and adjusting those AABBs by the size of the new object to determine regions where a center placement would cause a collision.  For example, with object 4, it means finding ranges of xc and yc that would cause a collision with the existing `[-0.135, -0.0375]` x `[-0.135, -0.0375]` AABB of the existing object.
           Collision zones for each object:
           *   Obj 4: `[-0.095, 0.0025]` x `[-0.095, 0.0025]`
           *   Obj 7: `[-0.0413, 0.095]` x `[-0.095, -0.0032]`
           *   Obj 5: `[-0.095, 0.0028]` x `[-0.0775, 0.095]`
           *   Obj 8: `[-0.0772, 0.0817]` x `[-0.0775, 0.0814]`
           
           Then I made some calculations to find a safe region.
           I need a non-colliding region for the new object.
           
           After evaluating potential regions, I decided on a primary safe region using `xc` between `0.0028` to `0.095` and `yc` between `0.0814` and `0.095`. I then generated a 7x4 grid of points (with spacing) for Object 6's center using linear interpolation, then repeated with 90-degree rotated orientations to reach the total of the required 50.

Model:     **Finding 50 Stable Placements for Object 6 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I need to find 50 stable placements for Object 6 on Surface 0, making sure it doesn't collide with objects 4, 7, 5, and 8 that are already placed. First, I calculated the valid range for Object 6's center `(xc, yc)` on Surface 0. Then, I defined the collision avoidance conditions by looking at the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) of the placed objects and determined the collision-free regions for Object 6's center.
           
           Object 6 is a square with a size of 0.08007818943468425. This means the object must fit within a `[-0.09496091, 0.09496091]` range for both `xc` and `yc`.
