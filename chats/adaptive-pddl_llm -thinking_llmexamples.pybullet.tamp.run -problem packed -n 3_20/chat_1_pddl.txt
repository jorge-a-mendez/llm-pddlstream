           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The core of this problem is about arranging objects, specifically getting `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`.  My initial instinct is to go through the motions:  `pick` them from their current positions (which are all on `v11`, from the look of it), and then `place` them onto `v16`. That's the obvious approach to satisfy `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.
           
           Now, digging deeper, I see that the problem is rooted in these `atpose` and `supported` predicates, which directly influence the `on` facts.  To change an `on` fact, I need to change these lower-level facts using actions like `pick` and `place`.
           
           However, here's the kicker: I'm restricted to using *only* the `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))` action.  This is a significant constraint!  This action just moves a base, and it doesn't touch the `atpose` or `supported` predicates. Therefore, it's completely useless for modifying those crucial `on` facts.
           
           Given that I can't use `pick` or `place`, I can't actually manipulate the positions of `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` as required. So, after a thorough analysis, it becomes evident that the goal, as stated, is simply unreachable with the given constraints. The available action doesn't allow the necessary changes to achieve the target state.
