           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of a Planning Problem with Limited Actions**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  Currently, based on the initial state,  `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are all on `v11`. To accomplish this, I need to get each of those objects *onto* `v16`.  The 'on' predicate implies that the object must be supported on something and be at a specific pose. For example, to make `on(v8, v16)` true, I'd need `supported(v8, ?p, v16)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)` for some pose `?p`.  I know that in the current state, `v8` is at `v9` supported by `v11`, so `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)` which I can write as `on(v8, v11)`. The same applies to `v12` and `v14`.
           
           The strategy, therefore, has to involve moving each object from its current position on `v11` to the desired location on `v16`. My understanding is that the only way to relocate these objects is via the *pick* and *place* actions.  *Pick* would manipulate the `atpose` of objects, and *place* would change their supported location. My focus is always on the preconditions and effects of my available actions, as those are the tools with which I will be able to change my current reality.
           
           However, here's the rub: the only action instance I'm given is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  That's a bit of a problem.  Essentially, I'm stuck, since this action doesn't actually *move* anything. It keeps my base stationary at `v3`. And, the essential actions that would be required to modify the *atpose* predicates of these three objects, are not available in the given list of action instances. I'm missing any action to pick and place. Without `pick` and `place`, I can't alter the `atpose` facts which will ultimately prevent me from successfully constructing `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`. The axioms for the `on` predicate are never going to be satisfied with only the `move_base` action.
           
           Therefore, the plan is unachievable with the provided action instances. It's a fundamental limitation that I cannot overcome. I've re-examined the problem and haven't missed anything. I'm stuck.
