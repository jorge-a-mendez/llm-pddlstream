(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5, size approximately 0.0968 x 0.0968) on a square surface (Surface 0) that's 0.27 x 0.27 centered at (0,0). My primary concern is ensuring the object's bounding box stays within the surface's bounds after any rotation.
           
           I'm starting by understanding the constraints. Since it's a square, rotation simplifies things. For any rotation 'theta', the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates are given by a rotated width, which is the original width multiplied by a factor depending on 'theta' (|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|) divided by two to get half rotated width. To ensure the whole object is in the surface I have to center the object bounding box at points that are half of object size in the x and y axes away from the surface edges. I need to make sure the object's bounding box is fully contained within the surface's AABB.
           
           To get those 50 placements, I'll use a strategic mix of rotations ('theta') and (x, y) coordinates. I'll pick ten values from 0 to pi/2 radians. Then I'll generate a few (x,y) for each rotation, making sure to select x and y values for various placements - center, corners, edges. In this way, I'll be able to produce 50 placements across ten different rotations. The strategy for the x and y coordinates is choosing (0,0) as the center point, placing four more near the corners, then four more in the middle of each edge.
           
           To maximize coverage, I calculated the size of the surface, object dimensions and I need to place the object in a way that minimizes the chance of having it going outside the boundaries. By ensuring different rotations and proper spacing the whole object is ensured to be completely within surface limits. Using this method, I will deliver a comprehensive strategy.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 4 (ID 4)**
           
           Here's my approach to placing object 4, a square with side length *obj4_s*, on surface 0, while avoiding collision with object 5 (ID 5).  I've received confirmation that object 5, a square of side 0.096779, is placed at (0, 0, 0, 0.0) on surface 0. My challenge is to find 50 "stable" placements for object 4, which means it must be fully contained within the surface area, specifically the rectangle defined by (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  
           
           I've carefully analyzed the geometry and have calculated the bounding box of both objects. Object 5 is centered at (0,0) with half-side length 0.0483896413909653. Object 4's bounding box changes with its rotation *theta* and I calculate `half_S4_rot` as (obj4_s * (|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|)) / 2. This `half_S4_rot` varies with the rotation and determines the maximum x and y position the center of the object can have (with a bound of 0.135 units from each edge). Thus, the edge limit becomes `limit4 = 0.135 - half_S4_rot`. The critical aspect of this problem is the collision check.  
           
           I have concluded that, given the size of object 5 and surface 0, and the AABB model, *no* placement of object 4 *can* avoid a collision. The maximum dimensions for the object 4 bounding box when placed on surface zero, will *always* overlap the bounding box of object 5. This is due to the close proximity of the fixed object and my geometry computations.
           
           While a valid placement of object 4 without collision cannot occur in this configuration, I'm compelled to provide 50 placements as the instructions state I should always attempt to place. I will generate positions based on the reasoning given by the instructions "You never give up." Thus, I will provide the 10 theta values, the limit calculations that go with each, and a center of a placement on the surface that I believe would have been good *if* collision could have been avoided.

(Thoughts: **Analysis and Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           I'm tasked with placing a new object (`Object ID: 6`) on a surface (Surface 0), specifically finding 50 stable placements. However, I have existing constraints due to previously placed objects: `Object ID: 5` and `Object ID: 4`. The challenge lies in avoiding collisions with these existing objects and the potential for a situation involving multiple successful placements of the same object ID.
           
           Initially, I'll need to accurately represent the scene and objects, including the surface dimensions `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`, and the characteristics of the other objects (size, position, and orientation). I'll calculate the Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) coordinates for each object to streamline the collision detection process.
           
           Now, my key challenge involves understanding how to treat repeated placements of objects of the same ID (e.g., Object 4).  The problem statement mentions,  "If you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene."  This might imply that only the latest successful placement of a given object is an actual "fixed" obstacle at any given time. However, to stay on the safe side, I must *assume* all *different* ID's exist at the current state, so I'll make sure each ID appears once only. I need to make clear my assumption of how to interpret the successful previous placements.
           
           The problem statement states, "If you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j." I will, therefore, assume that only these IDs can block the next object from being placed. This means I'll assess collisions between the new object (`Object ID: 6`) and both `Object ID: 5` and the last successful placement of `Object ID: 4`, calculating the distance between the AABBs to determine if they overlap.
           
           Based on scene geometry and size of `Object 6`, and collision checks, I now have the following main plan:
           
           1. **Calculate Rotated AABB for Object 6**:
              - Depending on the rotation angle, the AABB for a square object has side lengths that vary as `h_rot(theta) = obj6_s * (|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|) / 2`.
              - Based on limits of Surface 0 `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`, I calculate `limit6 = 0.135 - h_rot`, which is `limit(theta)`.
           
           2. **Define Fixed Obstacles (based on previous placements)`**:
              - `FO_5`: center `(0,0)`, `h5 = 0.0483895`.
              - `FO_4_B`: center `(0.088511, 0.088511)`, `h4 = 0.0464895`.
               Because FO_4_B and FO_5 have the same center, it makes it very difficult to place.
           
           3.  **Define Area to avoid FO_4_B**:
               - The range of values to avoid the `FO_4_B`:
               For this I consider the the FO4B collision region
                `FO4B_x_min = 0.088511 - h6_rot - 0.04649`
                `FO4B_x_max = 0.088511 + h6_rot + 0.04649`
                `FO4B_y_min = 0.088511 - h6_rot - 0.04649`
                `FO4B_y_max = 0.088511 + h6_rot + 0.04649`
           
           4.  **Find the placements for object 6**
           
           5. **Generate Diverse Placements**:
           
           *   **Avoid collisions with fixed Obstacles with limited rotations**
               *   Find the angle range (very narrow)
               *   Find (x, y) coordinates for placement
           *   **Generate placements**
               *   Then, generate 40 placements using various rotation angles within the specified surface limits.
           
           I'll start with rotations, and prioritize placing `Object ID: 6` in a way that
