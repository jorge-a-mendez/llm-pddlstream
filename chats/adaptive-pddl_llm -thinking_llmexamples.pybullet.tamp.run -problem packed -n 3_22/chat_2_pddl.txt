(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement: My Plan to Achieve the Goals**
           
           Okay, so I've got a clear goal: get objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`. Specifically, I need to ensure they are at the correct positions on `v16`. Looks like my tools are: controllable robot arm `v4` and base configuration `v3`. `v4` is currently hand-empty, which is ideal.
           
           Here's the situation: `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are currently on `v11` at distinct poses supported by `v11`. The goal is to move all of them to `v16`. Since all three objects are graspable and the appropriate `stackable` facts are present, the plan is straightforward: pick each object, move them to their final destination and place them on `v16`. All three can be placed at a shared pose `"#o2"` on `v16`, which simplifies things.
           
           Now for the details. The "kin" facts tell me how to manipulate these objects with `v4`. Specifically, to execute the `pick` and `place` actions, the base of the robot needs to be at a configuration called `#o3`. Initially, the robot base is at `v3`. Therefore, the primary move is a base motion from `v3` to `#o3`.
           
           My plan looks like this:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  First, I will move the robot base from its current configuration `v3` to `#o3`.
           2.  **Pick v8:** With the base now at `#o3`, I'll use `v4` to pick `v8` from its current pose on `v11`.
           3.  **Place v8:** Next, `v4` will place `v8` at the target pose `#o2` on `v16`.
           4.  **Pick v12:** Once the hand is empty, `v4` will pick `v12` from its current pose.
           5.  **Place v12:** I'll place `v12` at the target pose `#o2` on `v16`.
           6.  **Pick v14:** Grab `v14` from its initial pose.
           7.  **Place v14:** and finally, I'll place `v14` at the target pose `#o2` on `v16`.
           
           This should work. I've considered that the preconditions for each action are all satisfied given the initial state, facts, and what I deduce as valid assumptions.  Since I'm leveraging the 'kin' facts, the continuous parameters that are part of the actions (`#o0`, `#o1`, `#o2`, `#o3`, `#o4`) will be appropriately handled by the planner's underlying system.  I am confident that this sequence of actions will satisfy the goal conditions `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.
