(Thoughts: **Placing an Object on a Surface**
           
           My task is to find 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5, size 0.0966 x 0.0966) on a square surface (Surface 0, bounds (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135)).  The object must be entirely within the surface.
           
           I'm focusing on finding the surface index (which is always 0), the rotation angle (`theta`), and the object's center coordinates (x, y).
           
           Since it's a square object, the key is understanding how its bounding box changes as it rotates.  For a square, the effective bounding box width and height are:
           
           `W_rotated = H_rotated = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`, where `s` is the side length.
           
           The center must be within a range. The effective half-width and half-height `hw_eff = hh_eff = s/2 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`
           So, given the constraints of the surface I determine that the x range for the center is `(-0.135 + hw_eff, 0.135 - hw_eff)` and the y range is `(-0.135 + hh_eff, 0.135 - hh_eff)`.
           
           For placement, I select `theta` in the range of 0 to pi/2 (0 to 1.57 radians) to cover all orientations of the bounding box. After picking 7 `theta` values for different placements, I will use a simple grid to select 50 out of the combinations.
           
           <surf_idx> is always 0. The calculations are exact.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing and Planning Object Placement for Non-Collision**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed object ID 5. Its bounding box and position on surface 0 are known, and I've got the dimensions for a new square object, ID 4, which needs to fit safely on the same surface. The key is preventing a collision between these two objects.
           
           I'm starting by understanding the knowns: the location and size of object 5, the size of object 4, and the surface boundaries. The placement of object 5, along with its dimensions, defines the area it currently occupies. Since both objects are square, the process seems simpler, though I need to consider object 4's rotation (theta). The general rule is: any given point on the surface has coordinates `(x, y)`.  Given a square with side length s, half the side length is s/2, which, in the case of object 4, is s_obj4 / 2. Given that object 4 can be rotated, I am aware I need to consider `hw_eff`, the effective half-width of a rotated square.
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable and collision-free placements for object 4. To do this, I must first determine the AABB for object 5. The key is establishing a safe region on the surface for object 4 where it won't collide with object 5, regardless of rotation.
           
           To avoid collision, the bounding boxes of object 4 and object 5 must not overlap.  This means using the bounding box of object 5 to calculate coordinates where no overlap can occur. If the x-coordinate of object 4 exceeds the calculated minimum bound, there will be no collision. Likewise, the y coordinate must exceed the threshold.
           
           I'll start by defining the safe regions for object 4 for different rotation angles. I'll test rotations of 0, pi/12, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and 5*pi/12 radians.
           
           I've made the necessary calculations for hw_eff (the effective half-width, accounting for rotation) for each of these angles. I have the collision and avoidance conditions clearly stated. Now, for each angle, I will use a simple grid to generate potential placements. I'll evaluate the resulting (x,y) locations against the safe thresholds for each rotation. After that, any remaining unsafe locations must be removed from the list.
           
           After going through each rotation, it becomes a problem of generating possible object 4 placements and screening out the collisions.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I need to figure out where to place this new object (ID 6) on surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into either object 5 or object 4.  The surface is a square.  I've already calculated the AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) for the existing objects, which helps me determine the regions I need to avoid.
           
           My main strategy is this:
           
           1.  **Rotation First:** I'll start by checking different rotation angles for the new object. Each angle changes its effective size and shape.
           2.  **Effective Size:**  For each angle, I need to figure out how big the object *appears*  to be in the X and Y directions. This is the `hw_eff` and `hh_eff` values.
           3.  **Surface Limits:** Based on the effective size, I'll calculate the valid range within the surface where the object *can* be placed without going off the edge.
           4.  **Collision Checks (Crucial):** For each possible position (x, y) within the valid range, I have to *rigorously* check for collisions. This is where I'll use the AABBs.
               *   I'll calculate *another* AABB for the new object.
               *   I'll see if the object's AABB overlaps with the AABBs of objects 4 and 5.
           
           Here's a breakdown of the collision check: A placement is valid *if and only if* it DOESN'T overlap with R5 (object 5) AND it DOESN'T overlap with R4 (object 4). I've got a function to quickly determine those overlaps.
           
           I'll use a denser grid of placement candidates to get 50 valid placements. That should give me a good variety of positions. I am using `x` and `y` coordinates for placement, and `theta` is the angle of rotation for each object.
           
           This should give me the 50 placements I need, and the check function will make sure I don't accidentally let any collisions slip through!

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object 7 on Surface 0**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 7) on Surface 0, a region defined as  `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  This must be done without any collisions with three existing objects: (ID 5), (ID 4), and (ID 6).  Object 7 is a square with side length 0.07852906040200419.  My approach focuses on calculating the axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) for Object 7 at various rotations and ensuring this box doesn't overlap with the AABBs of the existing objects.
           
           First, I precalculate the  `hw_eff` (effective half-width/height) for object 7 for the following angles:  0, pi/12, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, 5*pi/12, and pi/2.  I then generate candidate (x, y) coordinates within the valid surface area, considering the object's rotation.   For each combination of angle and (x, y) position, I calculate the AABB of Object 7.  I use  `overlap()` to check for collision with the AABBs of the three existing objects  (5, 4, and 6), which I have precisely defined.  If there's no overlap, the placement is added to the valid list.
           
           I initially prioritize placements towards the right and upper-right corners. If I cannot meet the target of 50 stable placements I adjust my strategy.  I expand the range of possible angles and refine the granularity of positions on the surface.   The final output will be a set of 50 (or fewer if no solution exists) valid placement locations for Object 7, represented as:  (surface index, theta, x, y).

My approach focuses on calculating the axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) for Object 7 at various rotations and ensuring this box doesn't overlap with the AABBs of the existing objects.
           
           First, I precalculate the  `hw_eff` (effective half-width/height) for object 7 for the following angles:  0, pi/12, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, 5*pi/12, and pi/2.  I then generate candidate (x, y) coordinates within the valid surface area, considering the object's rotation.   For each combination of angle and (x, y) position, I calculate the AABB of Object 7.  I use  `overlap()` to check for collision with the AABBs of the three existing objects  (5, 4, and 6), which I have precisely defined.  If there's no overlap, the placement is added to the valid list.
           
           I initially prioritize placements towards the right and upper-right corners. If I cannot meet the target of 50 stable placements I adjust my strategy.  I expand the range of possible angles and refine the granularity of positions on the surface.   The final output will be a set of 50 (or fewer if no solution exists) valid placement locations for Object 7, represented as:  (surface index, theta, x, y).
