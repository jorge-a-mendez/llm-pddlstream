User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Analysis and Strategy for Robot Base Placement**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding three good spots for a robot base around a specific target point, ensuring each is within 2 units of the target and the overall workspace bounds (-2.45 to 2.45 in both x and y). I've got a list of fixed obstacles to avoid. I'll need to make sure the robot's base isn't *in* an obstacle and that there's a clear line of sight to the target. I'll automatically set the robot's orientation towards the target.
           
           Looking at the environment, there's a rectangular boundary (the outer walls). Inside, there are also four walls defining a slightly smaller, more usable space (roughly -2.45 to 2.45). There's a significant vertical wall at x = 0 that will likely cause occlusions. Finally, there are a few smaller rectangular obstacles scattered around.
           
           My strategy is as follows: first, I'll calculate the target point which will be denoted as `(-1.61, -0.63)`.
           I'll begin by focusing on positions that are at the maximum range (2 units) from the target, but I'll make sure to stay on the same side of the vertical x=0 wall as the target to minimize potential line-of-sight issues. Checking for collisions, I'll generate candidates at the maximum range which are then checked for line-of-sight issues.
           
           The target point is `(-1.614867919293125, -0.6358896001150419)`.
           
           **Candidate Positions and Rationale:**
           
           1.  **Above:**  `(-1.614867919293125, 1.3641103998849581)`. I went directly above the target (2 units away). It's clear of other obstacles and within bounds. The robot base x will remain `x=-1.61` which means it is situated to the left of the central x=0 vertical wall.
           
           2.  **Left/Top:** `(-2.45, 1.1814090798849581)`. This position is placed on the left boundary of the area. It maintains the line of sight (verified in previous checks) since the vertical wall is to the right of the points in question.
           
           3.  **Bottom/Left:** `(-0.772815529293125, -2.45)`. This is bottom of the area, very close to the bottom wall. It is also valid.
           
           All three points satisfy the requirements of being within range of the target, within the defined bounds, and clear of both the fixed obstacles and potential occlusions, making them good candidates.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing Feedback and Refining Positioning Strategies**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of the problem and the steps I've taken to refine my approach, addressing the user's feedback. I'm aiming for diverse positions with line-of-sight to the target, avoiding collisions, and respecting the constraints of the environment.
           
           **Initial Assessment:**
           
           The user provided feedback on my previous attempt. The target point is `(0.461, 1.966)`. My initial attempts failed, primarily because I was misinterpreting the target's location and the resulting line of sight. It was important to check the x value of the target, and place the robot on the corresponding right side of the x-wall.
           
           **Key Learnings from Feedback:**
           
           1.  **Obstacle Proximity:** I realized the previous failures involved collisions. I needed to ensure my proposed robot positions were not exactly on the edge or within the boundary of an obstacle.
           2.  **Scene Division:**  I correctly identified that the target point falls to the *right* of the central wall (x = 0). This implied the robot also needed to be generally on the right side of that wall to secure line of sight.
           
           **Revised Strategy - Principles:**
           
           1.  **Scene Positioning:** Ensure the robot is positioned generally on the right side of the scene (x > 0.05).
           2.  **Environment Bounds:** Confirmed bounds for x and y are -2.5 to 2.5. To avoid collision, I need to constrain to `x > -2.44` and `x < 2.44` and the same for y.
           3.  **Distance Constraint:** Max distance between the robot and target point is 2.
           4.  **Target and Obstacle Interplay:** The most challenging part is line of sight if the target point is within an obstacle box. I will proceed with the assumption that line of sight *is* allowed and that it will simply have to be viewed without collision.
           5.  **Diversity:** I will aim for three varied positions.
           
           **New Positions Proposed - Considerations:**
           
           1.  **Point of Attack:** I took the initial failed locations, and tried to refine them to fit the specifications.
           
               *   **P1: Directly below target:** This worked by putting a robot x value, and calculating the corresponding y coordinate from the target point with the required distance, while keeping both variables in the valid range to avoid collision with the boundaries.
           
                   *   This lead me to try the formula `Rx = Tx, Ry = Ty - 2`
           
                   *   This position failed due to Obstacle 9 and Line of sight. I attempted again but the results from my distance calculations did not work.
           
               *   **P2:** Now I am trying to put a coordinate on the X value.
           
                   *   I will calculate the corresponding Y value from the distance with the formula ` Rx = Tx + 2, Ry = Ty`.
           
                   *   This also failed as my equation was not taking the boundary values into account.
           
                   *   I made a similar set of calculations, however I needed to pick a positive and negative to calculate the Y values.
           
                   *   I have now realized I can't put Ry higher than `2.44` or it will go above the environment bounds.
           
               *   **P3:** This is the same logic as the last, except using the `0.06` value to be to the right of the central wall.
           
                   *   This caused similar problems to P1. The coordinates put the robot outside the Y boundaries.
           
           2.  **Re-Evaluation:** I went back to the original proposal and started with finding valid coordinates for the robot placement.
           
               *   My solution was to try to pick a range for the target position. For P3, I decided to go with a 45-degree angle to place the robot.
           
                   *   This still failed for the same reasoning, as the boundaries would not be met.
           
           3.  **Refinement:** I realized, due to where the target is in the scene, the proposed positioning must fall outside the range of obstacles.
           
               *   This will allow me to ensure my line of sight is not cut off by one of the blocks.
           
               *   I determined the equation `Rx=Tx+dx`, and `Ry = Ty - dy`
           
               *   This solution will place the Robot at a 45 degree angle and place the Y value closer to the bounds.
           
           4.  **Detailed Review:** I took my original three proposals and ran them through the obstacles, checking for line of sight.
           
               *   I began with `P1`, and started the math, calculating where the robot would fall on a `(0.46,1.96)` scenario
