           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Planning Problem**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` on `v16`.  Essentially, I need to pick them up from their current positions on `v11` and place them onto `v16`.  The initial state tells me that `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are indeed *on* `v11` already.
           
           I have two arms, both empty (`handempty`).  I'm at a base configuration (`atbconf(v3)`) and the robot can move (`canmove()`).  The objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are graspable and currently supported by `v11`. `v16` is a stackable surface for these objects, and there are valid poses (`#o2`) on `v16` for each of them.  The grasps (`#o1`) are defined for each object.
           
           The *only* action I'm allowed to use is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action doesn't actually change anything because it moves the base from `v3` to `v3` - which is a no-op. It consumes the `canmove()` predicate. This is a massive limitation! I need `pick` and `place` actions to manipulate the objects.
           
           Since I am given the strict restriction that "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan," the `pick` and `place` actions are unavailable. Therefore, there's no way to change the objects' positions.
           
           Given these constraints, the goal is unreachable.  I cannot manipulate any object, and therefore cannot achieve the desired state.  The current state is the *only* reachable state.
