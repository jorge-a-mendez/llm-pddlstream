User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.086, 0.422), (0.182, 0.518)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.052, 0.457, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.797, 0.604).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.096, 0.414), (-0.009, 0.501)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.006, -0.356), (0.088, -0.275)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.047, -0.316, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.996, 0.092).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.134, 0.47, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.864, 0.503).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom atpose(v14, v15)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom supported(v14, v15, v11)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)

           Atom stackable(v14, v16)
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom stackable(v14, v10)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm dealing with. The goal is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`. Simple enough, right?  But there's a catch. The robot can't *move* to reach these objects, and the only "action" available is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, which... doesn't move the base at all.  Essentially, it's a no-op that just refreshes a 'canmove' condition. I need to make some plans to pick these objects from the table `v11` and place them on `v16`, but the robot is stuck in its current base configuration `v3`.
           
           The core problem, as I see it, comes down to understanding the 'supported' and 'atpose' predicates. To satisfy `on(object, surface)`, you need `supported(object, pose, surface)` *and* `atpose(object, pose)`.  The 'supported' part is easy: I see that `v16` *can* support these objects. However, `atpose` depends on the robot's ability to pick and place. And it appears the robot can't do that at all.
           
           Analyzing the scene, I see the objects are currently:
           *   `v8` at `v9` on `v11`
           *   `v12` at `v13` on `v11`
           *   `v14` at `v15` on `v11`
           
           The goal, however, requires them to be at `#o2` on `v16`. Since all the objects have to be supported at the same pose `#o2` on `v16`, the symbol is representing different objects, which means there are three distinct poses `#o2_v8`, `#o2_v12`, and `#o2_v14` on `v16`, because the problem statement describes a value for each individual object.
           
           **The Crucial Constraint: Limited Actions**
           
           The biggest blocker is the constraint on allowed actions: I'm *only* allowed to use `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. That means the robot's arms and grippers are stuck in space and can't perform any pick-and-place actions, according to the problem statement: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           Let me be absolutely clear: *if* I can only use `move_base`, then I cannot move these objects.  I am familiar with TAMP problems, and this is completely unusual. Most typical TAMP problems will include templates for pick and place actions, and allow you to find values for continuous parameters, which is how you will plan for the robot to move, and grasp and move objects. 
           
           **The Impossible Goal**
           
           To move `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`, I need to use `pick` and `place` actions, or some equivalent. However,  since these actions *aren't* in my list of allowed actions, it's impossible.  The precondition `atpose` facts of the goals will never change.
           
           **Conclusion: An Unachievable Goal**
           
           The core of the issue is the lack of *any* object manipulation actions. The goal is unachievable given the constraint on the available actions. I should clarify that in my solution.
