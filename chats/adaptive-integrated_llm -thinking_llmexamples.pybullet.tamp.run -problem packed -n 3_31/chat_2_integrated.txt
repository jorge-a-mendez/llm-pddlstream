User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.006, -0.356), (0.088, -0.275)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.086, 0.422), (0.182, 0.518)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.096, 0.414), (-0.009, 0.501)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.047, -0.316, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.996, 0.092).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.134, 0.47, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.864, 0.503).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.052, 0.457, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.797, 0.604).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my plan to tackle this stacking problem.**  I've got three objects, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, that need to end up "on" object `v16`. Currently, they're sitting on `v11`, and I need to move them. The key is that `v16` is the destination, and I've got a single symbolic pose, `#o2`, to use for *each* object.  That means I have to provide a unique continuous value for that pose for *each* object.
           
           My strategy is straightforward:  pick an object from its current location, move the robot base, and then place it on `v16` at a new, carefully chosen location.  To start, I need to get the robot base to base configuration `#o3` (which, right now, it's not at) to get the picks and places to work.
           
           The plan will look like this:
           
           1.  **Move the Base:** First, I need to change my base position from where it is to a safe position to start the task.
               This will mean something like `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` to move the base and then initialize `canmove()`.
           
           2.  **Pick and Place v8:**
               *   Pick `v8` from its current location using the `pick` action.  Preconditions are that the arm is empty, `v8` is in its starting position, and the robot is at the right base configuration.  I need a `kin` relation for this.
               *   Place `v8` on `v16` at a specific location that I'll call `#o2`  which will have its own coordinates.  I need another `kin` relation for this.
           
           3.  **Pick and Place v12:**
               *   Pick `v12`.
               *   Place `v12` at *another* location, also called `#o2`, but with its *own* specific coordinates.
           
           4.  **Pick and Place v14:**
               *   Pick `v14`.
               *   Place `v14` at *another* location, still called `#o2`, with its *own* coordinates.
           
           I need to make sure I don't cause any collisions.  The initial objects' poses (that is, their coordinates) are all in different places to start, and the target surface for the objects is a rectangle around the center. I can fit the 3 objects by arranging them horizontally.  I need to make sure the poses are collision free and that the picks and places are achievable. Given the available actions (like `kin` relations) this setup should work and achieve the goals.
           
           The values for `#o2` on `v16` will be distinct positions, carefully calculated.
           
           I've determined I can place `v8` at the position: `-0.08, 0, 0.781`
           I've determined I can place `v12` at the position: `0, 0, 0.781`
           I've determined I can place `v14` at the position: `0.08, 0, 0.781`
           
           The coordinates are for the centers of each of the objects.
           
           The remaining actions will be determined as needed by the robot planning. No additional information or parameters are needed. The overall plan cost will be minimized given the specific functions for calculating costs that I will use. This task is now ready for execution.
