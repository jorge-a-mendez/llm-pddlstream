User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           #o1: object

           v10: object

           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object

           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.006, -0.356), (0.088, -0.275)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.086, 0.422), (0.182, 0.518)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.096, 0.414), (-0.009, 0.501)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.047, -0.316, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.996, 0.092).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.134, 0.47, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.864, 0.503).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.052, 0.457, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.797, 0.604).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's my plan to achieve the goal of placing objects v8, v12, and v14 onto v16.**
           
           First, I identified that I need to pick these objects from their current location on the support surface v11 and place them onto v16. I can only do this using arm v4, as the kin facts are defined for this arm. The robot's base configuration is currently at v3.
           
           My approach involves the following steps:
           
           1.  **Pick v8 from its current pose on v11.** This is a `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)` action.
           2.  **Place v8 onto v16 at a specific pose #o2.** This is a `place(v4, v8, #o2_v8, #o1, v3, #o4)` action. I need to make sure the pose #o2 is appropriate for v8.
           3.  **Pick v12 from its current pose on v11.** This is a `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, v3, #o4)` action.
           4.  **Place v12 onto v16 at a specific pose #o2.** This is a `place(v4, v12, #o2_v12, #o1, v3, #o4)` action. I need to make sure the pose #o2 is appropriate for v12.
           5.  **Pick v14 from its current pose on v11.** This is a `pick(v4, v14, v15, #o1, v3, #o4)` action.
           6.  **Place v14 onto v16 at a specific pose #o2.** This is a `place(v4, v14, #o2_v14, #o1, v3, #o4)` action. I need to make sure the pose #o2 is appropriate for v14.
           
           I have to carefully plan the poses on v16 to avoid collisions. I will also have to confirm that all preconditions for pick and place are met, i.e., canmove(), handempty() and so on.
           
           The relevant continuous parameters I need to address are the poses on the surface (v16) for each object. For `#o2`, I have distinct poses for each object to make sure no collisions happen. Specifically, `(-0.08 0.0 0.781 0.0)` for v8, `(0.08 0.0 0.781 0.0)` for v12, and `(0.0 0.08 0.781 0.0)` for v14.
           
           Since the robot's base configuration is v3, I do not need to perform `move_base`. The robot is already in the correct base position.
           
           In summary, I will use three pick/place pairs for each of the objects, at a total of 6 cost to solve this problem.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I was given a plan, but it was rightly rejected because it tried to use actions outside the allowed set. The only action I'm permitted to use is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This is a pretty useless action in this context - it doesn't actually change anything relevant to the state. It essentially moves the base to itself.
           
           The goal is to get objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`. Currently, they are all on `v11`. Clearly, this necessitates some form of manipulating these objects, right?  I need `pick` and `place` actions at the very least. I need to be able to *do* something.
           
           However, since `pick` and `place` are not in the permitted action list, I'm completely hamstrung. There's no way to reach the desired state with these constraints. Therefore, I must conclude that the goal is currently *unreachable* given the limited action set.
