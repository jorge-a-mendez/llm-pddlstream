           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Goal Achievement Plan**
           
           My primary objective is to devise a plan to satisfy the conditions outlined in the axiom `new-axiom@0()`. This involves ensuring specific predicates related to image reception, stone and soil analysis, and location configuration are all true. Initially, I examine the provided domain, initial state, and permitted actions to determine the feasibility of achieving this goal.
           
           I start by evaluating each precondition within the `new-axiom@0()` goal. The initial state satisfies the positional and storage constraints, the first four predicates. However, achieving the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates requires further actions. I identify that the `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions are required to satisfy these. However, I analyze the preconditions to identify the bottlenecks that I will face.
           
           `send_image` preconditions necessitate both image acquisition and communication to the lander. The ability to calibrate the camera and take an image is present. The primary challenge lies in the rovers being in the correct communication configuration (`#o0`) as they are currently in `v13` and `v15` configurations, respectively. I identify that the `move` actions do not enable the rovers to traverse to `#o0`. The lander configuration cannot be achieved. The same is true for the `send_analysis`. Therefore, the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates cannot be true.
           
           I also thoroughly consider the implications of preconditions for the `sample_rock` action needed for analysis. The preconditions `atconf(?v, ?q)` pose a challenge. The rovers are not at the specific configurations (#o5) necessary for sampling and analysis. Also, the rovers are not above all the soil and rocks, therefore the analysis goal cannot be accomplished.
           
           After careful consideration of the actions, conditions, and initial state I can conclude that, given the provided actions and the initial configuration, the goal is unachievable. The rovers cannot reach the required configurations for communication or analysis due to the limitations of the existing `move` actions.
