User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object

           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.517, 0.408, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.978, -0.207).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.563, 0.362), (-4.471, 0.454)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's break this down from my perspective.** I'm tasked with achieving a specific goal, `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially means I need to get a specific object, let's call it 'green', onto a target surface.  Specifically, I have to ensure 'green' is on a surface and is also a certain type.  I know 'green' can be either object 'v8' or 'v12'. My initial assessment of the scene shows that 'v8' and 'v12' are both stackable on the target surface 'v18', but I'm going to focus on 'v8' for now.
           
           'v8' is currently sitting on 'v9', and my immediate task is to get 'v8' onto 'v18'. 'v18' is a nice, large surface, but 'v8' needs to be at a particular pose on it.  The initial state gives me a hint; 'v8' is already supported by 'v18' at a location, so I just need to get the object to that same location.
           
           The robot has two arms at its disposal, 'v4' and 'v6', both currently hand-empty. My plan is to use 'v4', the arm currently located at 'v5'.  The robot's base is currently at configuration 'v3'.
           
           The core of my plan is straightforward:
           
           1.  **Move the base**: Since I need to use the arm, I need to get the base into a position where it can reach 'v8' and 'v18'. This means moving from 'v3' to 'o3'.
           2.  **Pick 'v8'**: The arm 'v4' will grab object 'v8' from its current location, 'v9'. This requires the robot's base to be at 'o3'.
           3.  **Place 'v8'**: Once I have 'v8' in hand, I will place it onto 'v18' at the specified pose, which is #o2.
           
           Let's look more closely at the continuous parameters here. '#o0' is essentially a trajectory for the base motion, but it's not relevant for cost calculation in this environment. `#o1` is a grasp and also not a source of continuous value in this case.  The crucial parameter is `#o2`, which represents the object's final placement on the table.
           
           After all of this, the final conditions are achieved, and, hence, `new-axiom@0()` can be said to be achieved.
