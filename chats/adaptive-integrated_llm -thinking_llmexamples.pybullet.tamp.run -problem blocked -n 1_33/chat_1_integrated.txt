User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           v15: object
           v16: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.517, 0.408, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.978, -0.207).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.563, 0.362), (-4.471, 0.454)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis and Planning for `new-axiom@0()` Achievement**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to placing an object, let's call it `?green`, onto another object, `v18`. From the initial state, we know `?green` can be either `v8` or `v12`.  Since both are "type-matched" with the axiom's requirement, we'll need to figure out how to put one of them on `v18`.
           
           Examining the definition of `on(?o, ?r)`, we need to find a way to meet the `supported` and `atpose` predicates.  We *do* have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. This means we can place `v8` or `v12` onto `v18` at `pose #o2`.
           
           Let's focus on `v8` for now. Currently, `v8` is at pose `v9`. We need to achieve `atpose(v8, #o2)`.  That calls for a standard `pick` and `place` action sequence.
           
           Now, we'll delve into the preconditions and effects of the actions. The `pick` action requires things like:
           1.  `kin` relationships (we have those).
           2.  `atpose(v8, v9)` (already true).
           3.  `handempty(v4)` (true).
           4. `atbconf(#q)` (bconf is the base configuration). The only base motion here is `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)`.  The robot is already in configuration `v3` and can't change it. So `#o3 = v3`, base configuration should be `v3`, which is consistent.
           5.  No `unsafeapproach` or `unsafeatraj` (which we assume, because we don't have this in initial state)
           
           So, the `pick` looks good if we assume `#o3` is `v3` which is the only option in this problem.
           
           After `pick`, `v8` is grasped and not at `v9`.
           
           For the `place` action, the preconditions are similar, also the `kin` relationship from initial state for  `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)` is needed. This looks valid if we choose the right value for the `#o2`.
           
           Now for the continuous parameters:
           
           *   `#o2`: This is the crucial pose.  We need to find a collision-free and stable pose for `v8` on `v18`. Based on the AABB information, the estimated placement on `v18` center is `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`. `z=0.8` matches the existing object height.
           
           So the plan is:
           1.  `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           2.  `place(v4, v8, (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0), #o1, v3, #o4)`
           
           and it should work given the initial state. The cost of such plan is the summation of `pickcost` and `placecost` from the definition.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Understanding the Limitations: A Dead End**
           
           Okay, the user's critique is clear. My initial plan was flawed because I used actions not permitted by the provided list. I'm now constrained to only using `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.
           
           Looking at the details of this action, it simply moves the robot's base from `v3` to `v3` using trajectory `#o0`. It's a self-move, essentially. The preconditions are: the robot is in motion at `v3` using trajectory `#o0`, the robot is at configuration `v3`, and the robot *can* move. The effects are that the robot remains at `v3` (so, no change there), and `canmove()` becomes false, effectively disabling further movement. This last point is where things get tricky.
           
           My goal is `on(?green, v18)`, which, at its core, means placing an object (?green) on a specific location (v18).  To achieve this, I've previously determined I need to pick up an object from its starting location (v9), and then place it at the desired pose (#o2 on v18).  However, the allowed `move_base` action doesn't let me do that!  The `pick` and `place` actions that I need to manipulate objects aren't on the valid action list.
           
           Here's the problem in a nutshell: the only available action turns off the robot's ability to move, while the goal *requires* moving an object. It's a paradoxical situation.  Since `move_base` invalidates `canmove()`, which is a requirement of `pick` and `place`... and those two are *necessary* for the goal... I've hit a wall. Using the permitted action, the goal is simply *unreachable*. No matter how I try to arrange the `move_base` action, I'm stuck: the constraints are too tight.
