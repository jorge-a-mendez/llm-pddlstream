User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.517, 0.408, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.978, -0.207).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.563, 0.362), (-4.471, 0.454)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v14)
           Atom stackable(v15, v10)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)

           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom pose(v15, v16)

           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)

           Atom stackable(v12, v18)
           Atom stackable(v8, v18)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom handempty(v4)

           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis: Goal Unreachable**
           
           Okay, so I'm looking at this problem, and the goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially means I need to get an object of a specific type "on" `v18`. From the initial state, I see that I have `v8` and `v12` as potential candidates – they both match the required type.
           
           The core of the problem boils down to getting either `v8` or `v12` to be both *supported* on `#o2` (which supports `v18`) *and* be at pose `#o2`. I need to rearrange things. I need to move one of those objects to `#o2`.
           
           Now, the available action here is the weird `move_base v3 v3 #o0` thing. It seems useless because it doesn't actually *do* anything that helps me. It only sets `canmove()` to false! In reality, I would want *pick* and *place* actions – the standard building blocks for this type of task.
           
           The initial state, as given, does *not* satisfy the axiom. `v8` is on something that *supports* it, but it isn't at `#o2`, and the same holds true for `v12`. I'd need an action to get them there.
           
           Given the constraints, I can't achieve this. There are no available actions that let me pick or place an object, so no matter how I twist the axioms, I can't satisfy the goal state. The initial state doesn't have the axioms, and the only possible action will not change it in a useful way.
