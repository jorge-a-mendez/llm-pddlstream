(Thoughts: **Object Placement on a Surface**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for an object with ID 5, dimensions 0.07 x 0.07, on surface 0, which is defined by the points (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0).  Since I'm dealing with an expert user, I'll dive right into the math.  A stable placement requires the object's center (x, y) to be within the bounds of the surface, considering the object's size and any rotation. The object's rotation (theta) can be 0, PI/2, PI, or 3PI/2. Since the object is square, the effective footprint doesn't change with these rotations.  So, I can mostly use theta = 0.  First, calculate the allowed x and y ranges. Half the object's size is 0.035, so the x-range goes from 4.235 to 4.765, and the y-range goes from -0.565 to -0.035. I know the surface is relatively large compared to the object (0.6 x 0.6 surface vs 0.07 x 0.07 object).  I'll start by generating a grid of positions on the surface. To ensure the object's placement is in the surface's valid bounds, I will need to consider the half of the object, which is 0.035.  The idea here is to create a grid of positions with a 0.07 step size so that objects won't overlap. Since there's plenty of space, a grid should give me more than enough placements. I'll start with x=4.235 and y=-0.565. The step size will be 0.07. Generating a nested loop, I am generating 8 `x` and 8 `y` locations, creating 64 potential positions. I can easily pick out 50 of those. The list of coordinates will be generated like so, so all 50 placements will be on `surf_idx = 0` and will have `theta = 0`.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 10**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new request here, and it's for object ID 10, which I know needs to be placed on surface ID 0. Good to keep in mind, I need to avoid any collisions. Since it's a new object, I don't have to worry about object ID 5 this time around, which I've got on record. I also know that square object ID 10 has a side length of 0.09374431270057926.
           
           First, I've defined the usable range for the center (x, y) of the object on surface 0. My calculations show that the x-range is from 4.24687 to 4.75313, and the y-range is from -0.55313 to -0.04687. A crucial element in this computation is that I have approximated half_side_10.  Since this is a square and the surface is AABB, I can stick with a theta value of 0.
           
           My plan is to generate a grid of potential placements. My initial thought was to use a step size equal to the object's side length, but I'll increase density using half of the side length for both x and y.
           
           For the x-coordinates, I've calculated 11 valid positions between 4.24687 and 4.71559 using a step of 0.046872. Likewise, I've found 11 valid y-coordinates between -0.55313 and -0.037538 using the same step size. This will generate 121 total placements, and from these, I'll take the first 50. All theta values will remain at 0.0. I can always adjust later if I need more points or if I want to play with the rotation.
