User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.218, -0.404), (-0.12, -0.306)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.169, -0.355, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.895, -0.447).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.071, 0.487), (0.021, 0.578)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.24, 0.115, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.135, 0.991).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.283, 0.072), (-0.197, 0.158)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.025, 0.532, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.191, 0.982).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unreachable Goal Due to Action Constraints**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` *on* `v16`. In planning terms, that means I need to make sure they're supported by `v16` and in the right poses. The provided initial state gives me a snapshot: my robot arms are empty, the robot base is at configuration `v3`, and those three objects are graspable, at different poses (`v9`, `v13`, `v15`) and currently supported by `v11`, not `v16`. They are also `stackable` on `v16`.
           
           The actions I *could* use, in principle, are `move_base`, `pick`, and `place`.  To achieve the goal, my strategy would normally be to *pick* each object from its initial pose and *place* it onto `v16`.  Easy enough, right?
           
           But here's the kicker: I'm only *allowed* to use the actions listed as "valid action instances." And guess what's on that list? Just one thing: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  That's it. A single action, which just moves the robot base from `v3` to... `v3`. That means *no* object manipulation.
           
           Now, considering the preconditions for picking and placing, this is a clear roadblock.  To pick, I need to know the kinematic configuration. And to place, I need to be holding the object.  I simply can't execute these actions without knowing the appropriate kinematic configurations and being able to manipulate the objects. Since I only have the base motion, it looks like this base motion doesn't help me with moving the objects.
           
           So, while I can *think* about how to achieve the goal (pick, place, repeat), the reality is that I can't.  The constraints are too tight. The goal is *unreachable*. No matter how I conceptualize the placement, I'm stuck with the robot's base moving without picking any object, which won't bring me to the required predicates to say that any object is on v16. I need to explain *why* it's unreachable, citing the lack of necessary action instances.
           
           In short, given the extremely limited set of *permitted* actions, and the need for object manipulation to satisfy the goal, I must conclude that the task is impossible to achieve.
