User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.218, -0.404), (-0.12, -0.306)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.283, 0.072), (-0.197, 0.158)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.169, -0.355, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.895, -0.447).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.071, 0.487), (0.021, 0.578)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.24, 0.115, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.135, 0.991).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.025, 0.532, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.191, 0.982).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning for the Plan**
           
           Okay, so I'm aiming to get objects v8, v12, and v14 onto surface v16.  This means using the robot's arm, which I'm calling v4, to pick each object from its initial location on v11 and put it down on v16 at a new spot.  The base can't move, stuck at v3.  The tricky part is figuring out where to *exactly* place each object on v16, making sure they don't crash into each other.  I've got three placement coordinates to compute.
           
           I've already figured out I can use the same generic "pose" symbol (#o2) in the problem description, since there is a corresponding value in the initial setup, and provide three *specific* sets of x,y,z,theta coordinates for each object. The key here is the fact that the initial state requires that the same name be referenced.
           
           I need the robot (v4 arm) to do three sets of actions: pick v8, place v8, pick v12, place v12, and then pick v14, place v14. Each `pick` and `place` action has preconditions (like being empty-handed, arm available, robot at base v3, the right kinematic configuration, and that it's safe to do.)
           
           So, for the placement coordinates: I've looked at the size of each object and figured out that they can be arranged side-by-side, if I use the center of v16 as a guide. Each object will get its own set of coordinates. They'll have a gap between them.
           
           The final result is three objects placed on surface v16.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Plan's Impossibility**
           
           Okay, so the user's feedback is spot on. I generated a plan using `pick` and `place` actions, and they've correctly pointed out those actions aren't even permitted. The only action at my disposal is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  That's... well, useless. It effectively does nothing except tell me the robot's base configuration remains unchanged.
           
           The goal is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all onto `v16`. Currently, they're all sitting comfortably on `v11`.  My initial state analysis shows they are at their initial poses, supported as expected.
           
           But here's the rub: I need to *manipulate* the objects. I need to lift them, move them, and put them down. The very nature of this problem screams for `pick` and `place`. But with only `move_base` available, I'm stuck. It's like trying to build a house with only a hammer and no nails, no wood, no foundation.
           
           Since `pick` and `place` are explicitly *excluded* from the action instances, this goal is unequivocally *unreachable* with the given action set. I need to revise my approach entirely. There's no way to achieve the desired state given the current constraints.
