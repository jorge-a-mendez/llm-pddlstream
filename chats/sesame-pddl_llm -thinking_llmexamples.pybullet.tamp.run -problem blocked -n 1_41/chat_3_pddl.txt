           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```

           ((place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ((pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ((place v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4))

           ((place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ((pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ((place v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.
           
           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q0', '#t1'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q0', '#q1', '#t3'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', '#p0', '#g0', '#q1', '#t2'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-traj-pose:('#t0', 'v15', 'v16')->()`, which impeded executing the action pick('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0').
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions.

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning:**
           
           My analysis starts by interpreting the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which requires placing an object of type `v17` (either `v8` or `v12`) on location `v18`. I evaluate the initial state and available actions, focusing on how to manipulate `v8` and `v12` to achieve this. The robot's arm, arm trajectories, and the base configuration are taken into account. I review a previously failed plan that attempted to pick `v8` but failed due to a collision detected during the arm trajectory.
           
           Examining the kin facts reveals that `v8` and `v12` could be placed at `#o2` for achieving the goal. The collision arises due to the presence of `v15` at position `v16`, which obstructs the robot's arm trajectory (`#o4`) needed for picking and placing either `v8` or `v12`. I examine the `pick` and `place` actions, discovering that *any* action involving `#o4` and objects within reach of the robot is predicted to fail by `unsafeatraj`. I examine the definition of `unsafeatraj` closely, and establish that its preconditions are met (a collision occurs when the arm trajectory `#o4` passes through the current location of `v15`).
           
           Because `v15` is an obstacle and the collision is due to its current location, and the available actions do not allow for moving `v15` prior to picking and placing `v8` or `v12`, I conclude that there's no way to rearrange the environment to fulfill the goal. This constitutes a *deadlock* situation, where the current state prevents successful object manipulation, making the goal unreachable with the provided actions. No valid plan can be constructed to achieve the specified goal, given the initial state and the constraints imposed by the blocked trajectory and the available actions.
