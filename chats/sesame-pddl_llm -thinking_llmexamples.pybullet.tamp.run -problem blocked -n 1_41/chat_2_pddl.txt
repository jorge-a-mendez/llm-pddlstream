           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning to Satisfy `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan that achieves the goal state defined by `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a particular type, `v17`, be `on` object `v18`. I first analyzed the available information in the initial state. I identified two objects, `v8` and `v12`, both of type `v17`. To satisfy the `on` predicate, I need to place either `v8` or `v12` on `v18`.
           
           Examining the initial state, both objects are graspable and currently supported by other objects. I noted that both `v8` and `v12` are stackable on `v18`. I also found that `v8` can be placed at a specific pose `#p0` on `v18` according to the fact `supported(v8, #p0, v18)`. Since both are viable, I opted to try placing `v8` first. This seemed like a simpler choice initially.
           
           To place `v8` on `v18`, I must execute a sequence of actions. I broke this down into a sequence of pick, move_base and place actions, ensuring each action has the right configuration. First, I must perform a `move_base` action to move the base from its initial configuration `v3` to a configuration needed for picking `v8`. Then, I will `pick` `v8` from its current pose `v9` using the provided grasping and trajectory data. Then, a second `move_base` action would adjust the base to a pose where `v8` can be placed on `v18` to satisfy the supported condition and reach pose `#p0`. Finally, the `place` action would be performed, placing `v8` at the target pose, `#p0`. After these actions the final state will satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` goal.
           
           I meticulously verified that all preconditions for each action were satisfied at each planning stage. I confirmed that required `basemotion` facts were available to support the `move_base` actions, that the grasping was viable, and that the trajectories were permissible. It seemed everything was achievable, and this specific plan would satisfy my defined goal of having `v8` on `v18` to be of the right type. I did not explore `v12` at this point, but could revert if the plan fails. It is likely that this same exact plan can be replicated with `v12`. I am confident that this plan is sound.
