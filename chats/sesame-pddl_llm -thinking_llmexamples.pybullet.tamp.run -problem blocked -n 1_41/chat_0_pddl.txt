           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's my thought process:**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which boils down to making sure an object is both of a certain type and "on" another object (i.e., at a specific pose). I've got a couple of objects that fit the type requirement. Let's start with `v8`.
           
           To get `v8` "on" something, I need to make it occupy a particular pose (`#o2`). This means I need to move it, which usually involves a `move_base` action followed by pick and place actions.
           
           First, to move the arm, I need to get the robot base to the correct position (`#o3`). That requires `move_base`. Once the base is right, then I move to pick the block.  I need to use `move_base` and then use `pick` to acquire the object and finally use `place` to move it.
           
           Let's test this strategy. The plan will be to perform `move_base`, then `pick`, then `place`.
           
           The initial state of these predicates is taken into account as the plan develops. This will let me achieve the goal of `on(v8, v18)`.
           
           It looks like the plan will achieve what I want.  I double-checked a couple things:
           *   I confirmed that the plan doesn't conflict with any preconditions or effects.
           *   I ensured I handled the `canmove()` predicate correctly, which is consumed by the `move_base` action but produced by `pick` and `place`.
           
           I then made sure I am using the right objects.
           
           Also, I made sure there aren't any less-costly plans that I've missed. It seems I will have a valid and hopefully minimal solution.
