(Thoughts: **The Path to `new-axiom@0()` in PR2-TAMP**
           
           My objective is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()` in the `pr2-tamp` domain. Based on the axioms, this means I need to make an object of `type v17` be `on v18`. I know from the initial state that `v12` is of type `v17`, so my specific goal becomes making `v12` be `on v18`.
           
           The `on` predicate is satisfied if an object is supported at a pose. I need to find a pose `p` where `v12` is supported by `v18`. Looking at the initial state, I see that `v12` is already supported at `#o2` by `v18`. Thus, I simply need to move `v12` to `#o2`.
           
           `v12` is currently at pose `v13`. I can use `pick` and `place` actions to manipulate it. To pick `v12`, I need the robot arm, `v4`, to be at the correct base configuration, which is currently `v3`. I notice that the `pick` action requires the base to be at a configuration that is linked to a symbolic base configuration, `#o3`, through a `basemotion` fact. Since my initial configuration is `v3`, I will need to use a `move_base` action.
           
           Therefore, the plan is as follows:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  I must first move the robot's base from `v3` to `#o3` (which is needed by `pick` and defined by `bconf(#o3)` in the initial state). This is achieved via `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`.
           
           2.  **Pick:** Then, I can execute `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)` to grasp `v12` from its current pose `v13`. I'll assume that the pre-conditions, such as ensuring that the grasp is safe and doesn't collide with anything, are met as the problem doesn't specify any violations of the `cfree` conditions.
           
           3.  **Place:** Finally, I'll place `v12` at pose `#o2` with `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`, and it will then be on `v18` as a result of a fact in the initial state (`supported(v12, #o2, v18)`).
           
           This plan gets the object, `v12`, on the correct target pose, which will have the effect of making `on(v12, v18)` true.  Since `v12` is already of type `v17`, I have successfully satisfied the requirements of `new-axiom@0()`.
