           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the breakdown of my thought process for achieving the goal `Atom new-axiom@0()`:**
           
           Okay, so I'm looking at this goal, `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially translates to having an object of a certain type (`v17`) be *on* another object (`v18`).  I need to identify which object satisfies these conditions in my current state.  From the provided information, I see that `v12` is of type `v17` and that it's stackable on `v18`. This tells me that `v12` is the object in question.
           
           My next step is to figure out what it means to be "on" something.  I know there's an axiom for that: `on(?o: object, ?r: object)`, and it requires `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`. So, I need `v12` to be at a particular pose `?p` supported by `v18`.  Luckily, the initial state gives me `supported(v12, #p1, v18)`, and `pose(v12, #p1)`.  So, my focus shifts to making sure `v12` is at pose `#p1`.
           
           Currently, `v12` is at pose `v13`.  To get it to `#p1`, I'm thinking I'll need to use pick and place actions.  The arm `v4` and the hand is empty.
           
           To pick up `v12`, I need to find a `pick` action that applies. I've found one. But that action includes a `kin` and needs the base at configuration `#q2`.  I see the base is currently at `v3`. That means I need to move the base from `v3` to `#q2` with `(move_base v3 #q2 #t6)`. This will satisfy the precondition of my `pick` action.
           
           After the base move, the `pick` action will work. The robot arm will move and hold `v12`.
           
           Now, with `v12` in my grasp, I need to place it. Looking at the possible `place` actions, the one that fits is `(place v4 v12 #p1 #g1 #q3 #t7)`. It requires the robot base in configuration `#q3`, but it's currently at `#q2`.  Another `move_base` is needed to complete the plan.
           
           I see a `move_base` action that moves the base from `#q2` to `#q3`  with `(move_base #q2 #q3 #o0)`. This sets up the correct precondition for my `place` action.
           
           Finally, I'll execute the `place` action.  This puts `v12` at pose `#p1`. Since it's supported by `v18`, the goal `on(v12, v18)` is true. And, since `v12` is of type `v17`, the overall goal `Atom new-axiom@0()` is achieved. I then re-check the provided plan's elements to make sure that the continuous parameters are bound in a valid fashion, with all their btrajs, atrajs, and poses well formed. They are.
           
           In summary, the plan is:
           1. `(move_base v3 #q2 #t6)`
           2. `(pick v4 v12 v13 #g1 #q2 #t5)`
           3. `(move_base #q2 #q3 #o0)`
           4. `(place v4 v12 #p1 #g1 #q3 #t7)`
