           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5 (a 0.07 x 0.07 square) on surface 0, which is defined by the points ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  My core assumption here is that "stable" means the object fits within the surface bounds and doesn't collide with anything *currently* in the scene – no fixed obstacles or other placed objects.  I'll define a placement as (surface index, rotation angle, x-coordinate of object center, y-coordinate of object center).
           
           First, let's figure out the feasible area. The surface is a 0.6 x 0.6 square. Given the object's dimensions, the center of the object must stay within certain bounds.  I've calculated those bounds. With the object's width and height being 0.07, and the surface extents being (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0), I get these: for an object orientation of 0 or pi/2, the center coordinates can range: x from 4.235 to 4.765, and y from -0.565 to -0.035.
           
           To generate 50 distinct placements, I'm going with a grid-like pattern.  I'll use 5 x 5 positions, giving me 25 placements. I'll then duplicate those 25 positions and rotate them by pi/2, effectively creating two distinct rotations for each placement: one at 0 radians and another at pi/2 radians, thus giving a total of 50 placements.
           
           The x and y coordinates are: x = [4.235, 4.3675, 4.5, 4.6325, 4.765] and y = [-0.565, -0.4325, -0.3, -0.1675, -0.035]. The first 25 placements will have theta=0 and these x and y coordinates, and the next 25 will have theta=pi/2 and the same x and y coordinates.
           
           I'm structuring the output as a list of tuples, and I'm generating them in Python. It'll be a loop through the calculated x and y coordinates using each rotation. This ensures a proper spread across the available surface area with a small variation of rotations, which is, in my professional opinion, a perfectly reasonable approach.
           
           The code will then output the placements in the desired format: a list of tuples, each representing (surface index, theta, x, y) for a stable placement. I'll then be able to submit these to the scene and evaluate the stability based on feedback.
