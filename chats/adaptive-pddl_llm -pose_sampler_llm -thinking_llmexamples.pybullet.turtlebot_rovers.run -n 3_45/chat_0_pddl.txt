           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Analysis: An Unachievable Mission**
           
           Okay, I've got a handle on the objective: `new-axiom@0()`. Breaking it down, I need to achieve the following: receive images for three objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`) using a specific mode (`v11`), and receive analyses for at least one rock of type 'stone' (`v2`) and one of type 'soil' (`v6`).  Simple enough, right?  But the devil's in the details... or rather, the *missing* details.
           
           First, the imaging.  My initial assessment was that rover `v14` was the best candidate, as `atconf(v14, v15)` is true, meaning it's ready to act.  I figured I'd use the camera (`v10`) to calibrate, take the images, and then send them via the lander (`v9`).  A standard image retrieval pipeline.  However, this involves actions like `calibrate`, `take_image`, and `send_image`.  A closer look at the *allowed* action instances reveals a serious problem: these crucial actions aren't on the list!  I'm limited to *only* `move` and `drop_rock`. This means my image capture strategy is dead in the water.
           
           Next, the analyses.  I'd planned to use the same rover, `v14`, as it also has a store (v16). With the appropriate sample and send actions I could get what I needed.  I'd need the rover to be `above` the rocks, so I could sample them. The challenge then is that the rover is currently at `atconf(v14, v15)`. The rocks are at configuration `#o5`. Even if the sampling and analysis actions *were* available, I'd need to move to `#o5` which isn't possible given the limited `move` actions.
           
           Essentially, I'm stuck. My plan for receiving images is blocked because the required image retrieval actions are prohibited. My plan for analyzing the rocks is blocked because the rovers' configuration cannot be changed using the allowed moves.
           
           The "drop_rock" action seems irrelevant, given that I'm supposed to receive, not to place anything in a store.
           
           Since I can't fulfill the image requirement and analysis requirement with only the "allowed" actions, the entire goal is unachievable, as specified. It's a mission impossible, without a set of actions that I'm allowed to execute.
