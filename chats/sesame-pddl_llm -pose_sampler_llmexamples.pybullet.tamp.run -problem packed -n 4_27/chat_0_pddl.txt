           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 4) -- 0.08176269976076067, 0.08176269976076067)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27. The object is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0818 x 0.0818. This means the object is significantly smaller than the surface, allowing for many possible placements.
           
           I will attempt to place the object on surface 0. Since the object is square, its orientation (theta) does not affect its bounding box, so I can use 0 for simplicity, or any other angle. I need to ensure that the object's bounding box is entirely within the surface's bounding box.
           
           Surface 0: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`
           Object size: `(0.08176269976076067, 0.08176269976076067)`
           
           The object's half-extents are approximately `0.04088`.
           For a placement `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`, the object's corners will be `(x +/- half_size_x, y +/- half_size_y)`.
           These must be within `(-0.135, 0.135)` for both x and y.
           So, `x - 0.04088 >= -0.135` => `x >= -0.135 + 0.04088 = -0.09412`
           And `x + 0.04088 <= 0.135` => `x <= 0.135 - 0.04088 = 0.09412`
           Similarly for y, `y >= -0.09412` and `y <= 0.09412`.
           
           This gives me a valid range for `x` and `y` from `-0.09412` to `0.09412`. I will generate a diverse set of placements within this range, using various angles as well, even if they don't change the AABB.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27.
           The new object (ID: 5) is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0733 x 0.0733.
           The previously placed object (ID: 4) is at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)` and has dimensions `0.08176 x 0.08176`.
           
           I need to place object 5 on surface 0, avoiding collision with object 4.
           Object 4's bounding box: `(-0.04088, -0.04088)` to `(0.04088, 0.04088)`.
           
           For object 5, its half-extents are approximately `0.03665`.
           The valid range for object 5's center, if placed alone, would be:
           `x >= -0.135 + 0.03665 = -0.09835`
           `x <= 0.135 - 0.03665 = 0.09835`
           Similarly for y, `y >= -0.09835` and `y <= 0.09835`.
           
           Now, I must avoid collision with object 4.
           To avoid collision, the distance between the centers of the two objects must be greater than the sum of their half-sizes.
           For axis-aligned bounding boxes (theta=0), if object 4 is at `(x4, y4)` and object 5 is at `(x5, y5)`, collision occurs if:
           `abs(x4 - x5) < (half_size_x4 + half_size_x5)` AND `abs(y4 - y5) < (half_size_y4 + half_size_y5)`
           
           Object 4 center: `(0.0, 0.0)`
           Object 4 half_size: `(0.04088, 0.04088)`
           Object 5 half_size: `(0.03665, 0.03665)`
           
           Sum of half_sizes for x: `0.04088 + 0.03665 = 0.07753`
           Sum of half_sizes for y: `0.04088 + 0.03665 = 0.07753`
           
           So, `abs(x5)` must be `>= 0.07753` OR `abs(y5)` must be `>= 0.07753` to avoid collision with object 4 (assuming theta=0 for both).
           I will prioritize placing object 5 outside the central region occupied by object 4. I will pick placements near the edges of the allowed region for object 5.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27.
           The new object (ID: 6) is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0720 x 0.0720.
           
           We have two previously placed objects:
           Object 4 (ID: 4): `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)` with size `0.08176 x 0.08176`.
           Object 5 (ID: 5): `(0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.08)` with size `0.07330 x 0.07330`.
           
           I need to place object 6 on surface 0, avoiding collision with object 4 and object 5.
           For simplicity, I will assume all objects are placed with `theta = 0`, as they are all square and their AABBs don't change with rotation.
           
           Object 4 AABB: `x in [-0.04088, 0.04088]`, `y in [-0.04088, 0.04088]`
           Object 5 AABB: center `(0.08, 0.08)`, half_size `0.03665`. So, `x in [0.08 - 0.03665, 0.08 + 0.03665] = [0.04335, 0.11665]`, `y in [0.04335, 0.11665]`.
           
           Object 6 half_size: `0.0720126746722809 / 2 = 0.03601`.
           The valid range for object 6's center, if placed alone, would be:
           `x >= -0.135 + 0.03601 = -0.09899`
           `x <= 0.135 - 0.03601 = 0.09899`
           Similarly for y, `y >= -0.09899` and `y <= 0.09899`.
           
           Now, I must avoid collision with object 4 and object 5.
           
           Collision condition for object A at `(xA, yA)` with half_extents `(hxA, hyA)` and object B at `(xB, yB)` with half_extents `(hxB, hyB)`:
           `abs(xA - xB) < (hxA + hxB)` AND `abs(yA - yB) < (hyA + hyB)`
           
           Avoid collision with Object 4:
           Object 4 half_size: `(0.04088, 0.04088)`
           Object 6 half_size: `(0.03601, 0.03601)`
           Sum of half_sizes: `0.04088 + 0.03601 = 0.07689`
           So, for object 6 at `(x6, y6)`, `abs(x6)` must be `>= 0.07689` OR `abs(y6)` must be `>= 0.07689`.
           
           Avoid collision with Object 5:
           Object 5 center: `(0.08, 0.08)`
           Object 5 half_size: `(0.03665, 0.03665)`
           Object 6 half_size: `(0.03601, 0.03601)`
           Sum of half_sizes: `0.03665 + 0.03601 = 0.07266`
           So, for object 6 at `(x6, y6)`, `abs(x6 - 0.08)` must be `>= 0.07266` OR `abs(y6 - 0.08)` must be `>= 0.07266`.
           
           Let's try to place object 6 in one of the remaining "corners" or along the edges. The region around `(0.0, 0.0)` and `(0.08, 0.08)` are occupied. I'll target the other corners like `(-0.08, 0.08)`, `(0.08, -0.08)`, or `(-0.08, -0.08)`.
           The available space is from `-0.09899` to `0.09899` for x and y.
           
           Candidate 1: `(-0.08, -0.08)`
           Against Object 4: `abs(-0.08) = 0.08 >= 0.07689` (Pass)
           Against Object 5: `abs(-0.08 - 0.08) = abs(-0.16) = 0.16 >= 0.07266` (Pass)
           This seems like a good candidate.
           
           Candidate 2: `(-0.08, 0.08)`
           Against Object 4: `abs(-0.08) = 0.08 >= 0.07689` (Pass)
           Against Object 5: `abs(-0.08 - 0.08) = abs(-0.16) = 0.16 >= 0.07266` (Pass)
           This is not necessarily `0.08`. `abs(y6 - 0.08) = abs(0.08 - 0.08) = 0.0`. This will collide with object 5 because `abs(x6 - 0.08) = abs(-0.08-0.08) = 0.16 >= 0.07266` but `abs(y6 - 0.08) = 0 < 0.07266`. So `(-0.08, 0.08)` is not valid. The collision for 5 is `abs(x6 - 0.08) < 0.07266 AND abs(y6 - 0.08) < 0.07266`. So for `(-0.08, 0.08)`, `abs(-0.08 - 0.08) = 0.16` and `abs(0.08 - 0.08) = 0`. Since `0 < 0.07266`, this would collide if the x condition was met, but it is not. My logic was slightly off. If one condition fails, it means no collision. So `(-0.08, 0.08)` is indeed valid against object 5.
           
           Let's re-evaluate `(-0.08, 0.08)`:
           x-range for obj 6: `[-0.08 - 0.03601, -0.08 + 0.03601] = [-0.11601, -0.04399]`
           y-range for obj 6: `[0.08 - 0.03601, 0.08 + 0.03601] = [0.04399, 0.11601]`
           This is entirely within the surface `[-0.135, 0.135]`.
           
           Collision with Object 4 (center `(0,0)`, half_size `0.04088`):
           Obj 6 x-range: `[-0.11601, -0.04399]`
           Obj 4 x-range: `[-0.04088, 0.04088]`
           No overlap in x. So no collision.
           
           Collision with Object 5 (center `(0.08, 0.08)`, half_size `0.03665`):
           Obj 6 x-range: `[-0.11601, -0.04399]`
           Obj 5 x-range: `[0.04335, 0.11665]`
           No overlap in x. So no collision.
           
           This confirms `(-0.08, 0.08)` is a valid placement. Similarly `(-0.08, -0.08)` and `(0.08, -0.08)` should be valid.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27.
           The new object (ID: 7) is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0959 x 0.0959.
           
           We have three previously placed objects:
           Object 4 (ID: 4): `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)` with size `0.08176 x 0.08176`.
           Object 5 (ID: 5): `(0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.08)` with size `0.07330 x 0.07330`.
           Object 6 (ID: 6): `(0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.08)` with size `0.07201 x 0.07201`.
           
           I need to place object 7 on surface 0, avoiding collision with objects 4, 5, and 6.
           For simplicity, I will assume all objects are placed with `theta = 0`, as they are all square and their AABBs don't change with rotation.
           
           Object 4 AABB: `x in [-0.04088, 0.04088]`, `y in [-0.04088, 0.04088]`
           Object 5 AABB: center `(0.08, 0.08)`, half_size `0.03665`. So, `x in [0.04335, 0.11665]`, `y in [0.04335, 0.11665]`.
           Object 6 AABB: center `(-0.08, 0.08)`, half_size `0.03601`. So, `x in [-0.11601, -0.04399]`, `y in [0.04399, 0.11601]`.
           
           Object 7 half_size: `0.09590365214140956 / 2 = 0.04795`.
           The valid range for object 7's center, if placed alone, would be:
           `x >= -0.135 + 0.04795 = -0.08705`
           `x <= 0.135 - 0.04795 = 0.08705`
           Similarly for y, `y >= -0.08705` and `y <= 0.08705`.
           
           Now, I must avoid collision with objects 4, 5, and 6.
           Collision condition: `abs(xA - xB) < (hxA + hxB)` AND `abs(yA - yB) < (hyA + hyB)`
           
           Avoid collision with Object 4 (center `(0,0)`, half_size `0.04088`):
           Object 7 half_size: `(0.04795, 0.04795)`
           Sum of half_sizes: `0.04088 + 0.04795 = 0.08883`
           So, for object 7 at `(x7, y7)`, `abs(x7)` must be `>= 0.08883` OR `abs(y7)` must be `>= 0.08883`.
           
           Avoid collision with Object 5 (center `(0.08, 0.08)`, half_size `0.03665`):
           Sum of half_sizes: `0.03665 + 0.04795 = 0.08460`
           So, for object 7 at `(x7, y7)`, `abs(x7 - 0.08)` must be `>= 0.08460` OR `abs(y7 - 0.08)` must be `>= 0.08460`.
           
           Avoid collision with Object 6 (center `(-0.08, 0.08)`, half_size `0.03601`):
           Sum of half_sizes: `0.03601 + 0.04795 = 0.08396`
           So, for object 7 at `(x7, y7)`, `abs(x7 - (-0.08))` must be `>= 0.08396` OR `abs(y7 - 0.08)` must be `>= 0.08396`.
           
           Let's try to find an open space. The centers `(0,0)`, `(0.08, 0.08)`, `(-0.08, 0.08)` are occupied.
           The allowed range for object 7's center is `x, y in [-0.08705, 0.08705]`.
           
           Let's consider `(0.08, -0.08)` as a candidate position for object 7.
           Check against surface bounds: `0.08` is within `[-0.08705, 0.08705]` for x and `-0.08` is within `[-0.08705, 0.08705]` for y. No, `0.08` for x and y are outside of the allowed range `[-0.08705, 0.08705]`. I must use a value <= 0.08705 or >= -0.08705.
           This means the maximum x or y value for the center of object 7 is 0.08705.
           
           Let's try `(0.0, -0.08)`
           Against surface bounds: `0.0` is within `[-0.08705, 0.08705]`, `-0.08` is within `[-0.08705, 0.08705]`. (Pass)
           
           Against Object 4 (center `(0,0)`):
           `abs(0.0 - 0.0) = 0`, `abs(-0.08 - 0.0) = 0.08`.
           Since `0 < 0.08883` and `0.08 < 0.08883`, this *would* collide with object 4 if both were true. Oh, collision is AND. Not collision is OR.
           Condition for NO collision: `abs(x7 - x4) >= (h_x7 + h_x4)` OR `abs(y7 - y4) >= (h_y7 + h_y4)`
           `abs(0.0 - 0.0) = 0`. `0 < 0.08883`. (Fails first part of OR)
           `abs(-0.08 - 0.0) = 0.08`. `0.08 < 0.08883`. (Fails second part of OR)
           Since both parts of the OR fail, it means it *would* collide. So `(0.0, -0.08)` is not suitable.
           
           Let's try placing object 7 at `(0.08, -0.08)` with a slight adjustment to fit the bounds. Maximum center coordinates are 0.087.
           Let's try `(0.085, -0.085)` for object 7.
           This is within surface bounds.
           
           Check against Object 4 (center `(0,0)`, half_size `0.04088`, sum_half_sizes `0.08883`):
           `abs(0.085 - 0) = 0.085`. `0.085 < 0.08883`.
           `abs(-0.085 - 0) = 0.085`. `0.085 < 0.08883`.
           This would collide with object 4. I need `abs(x)` or `abs(y)` to be *greater than or equal to* 0.08883.
           My available range for x,y is `[-0.08705, 0.08705]`. This means that `abs(x)` and `abs(y)` for object 7's center will always be less than or equal to `0.08705`.
           Since `0.08705 < 0.08883`, it means that object 7's AABB will ALWAYS overlap with object 4's AABB if object 7 is placed at `theta=0`.
           This is a problem! Object 7 is quite large. Its half-size is `0.04795`.
           Object 4's half-size is `0.04088`.
           Sum of half sizes: `0.04795 + 0.04088 = 0.08883`.
           The maximum displacement of object 7's center from the origin for its AABB to be within the surface is `0.135 - 0.04795 = 0.08705`.
           So if `x7` and `y7` are within `[-0.08705, 0.08705]`, then `abs(x7) <= 0.08705` and `abs(y7) <= 0.08705`.
           But to avoid collision with Object 4, `abs(x7)` must be `>= 0.08883` OR `abs(y7)` must be `>= 0.08883`.
           This is impossible! It means at `theta=0`, object 7 will always collide with object 4.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the object AABB for rotation.
           Object 7 (square, size `s`) has an AABB that changes with rotation.
           For `theta = 0` or `pi/2`, AABB is `s x s`.
           For `theta = pi/4`, the diagonal is `s * sqrt(2)`. The AABB in this case would be `(s * sqrt(2)) x (s * sqrt(2))`.
           Object 7 size `s = 0.09590`.
           If `theta = 0`, half_size `h = s/2 = 0.04795`.
           If `theta = pi/4`, half_size `h_rotated = (s * sqrt(2))/2 = 0.09590 * 0.7071 = 0.06780`.
           This means when rotated by `pi/4`, the object's effective half_size is larger, making it even harder to place.
           
           Let's assume the problem means the *object's actual dimensions* are `size_x, size_y` and these define its AABB *when oriented along the axes*. Any rotation will increase the effective AABB (for a square object, unless it's a multiple of 90 degrees). So I must assume `theta=0` or `theta=pi/2` for the initial AABB calculation unless specified. The problem statement says "x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)". This often implies the dimensions when the object is *not rotated*. However, later it refers to "orientation (theta)". I will stick to the interpretation that `size_x, size_y` are the dimensions of the object itself, and its AABB *changes* with rotation. This is usually how it works in physics engines.
           
           If `theta = 0` (or `pi/2`, `pi`, `3pi/2` etc.), object 7's half-extents are `0.04795`.
           The object can be placed such that its center `(x, y)` satisfies `abs(x) <= 0.135 - 0.04795 = 0.08705` and `abs(y) <= 0.135 - 0.04795 = 0.08705`.
           Object 4's half-extents are `0.04088`.
           To avoid collision with object 4, the separation distance in x or y must be `0.04795 + 0.04088 = 0.08883`.
           This means `abs(x_7 - x_4)` must be `>= 0.08883` or `abs(y_7 - y_4)` must be `>= 0.08883`.
           Since `x_4 = 0` and `y_4 = 0`, it means `abs(x_7)` must be `>= 0.08883` or `abs(y_7)` must be `>= 0.08883`.
           However, the maximum `abs(x_7)` or `abs(y_7)` we can have is `0.08705`.
           Since `0.08705 < 0.08883`, it is IMPOSSIBLE to place object 7 without colliding with object 4 if `theta=0` (or multiples of pi/2).
           
           This means I must use a rotated orientation for Object 7.
           If object 7 is rotated, its AABB becomes larger. For a square of side `s`, rotated by `theta`, the half-width of the AABB is `0.5 * (s * abs(cos(theta)) + s * abs(sin(theta)))`.
           No, that's not right. The half-width of the AABB of a square `s x s` rotated by `theta` is `s/2 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This is for a square rotated such that its corners are on the axes, which is not what's happening.
           
           The half-width of the AABB of a square of side `s` rotated by `theta` is `max(s/2 * abs(cos(theta)), s/2 * abs(sin(theta)))` if `theta` is measured from the side.
           No, that's not right either. The effective half-width of the AABB of a square of side `s` rotated by `theta` is `s/2 * (cos(theta_prime) + sin(theta_prime))` where `theta_prime = theta mod pi/2`. The max half dimension occurs at `theta = pi/4`.
           For a square object of side `s = 0.09590`, the maximum AABB half-dimension occurs at 45 degrees.
           `s_rotated_half = (s / 2) * sqrt(2)`. No, this is for a bounding circle.
           
           Let's be precise. A square of side `s`, centered at origin. Vertices are `(s/2, s/2), (-s/2, s/2), (-s/2, -s/2), (s/2, -s/2)`.
           When rotated by `theta`, a vertex `(x,y)` becomes `(x cos(theta) - y sin(theta), x sin(theta) + y cos(theta))`.
           The new AABB for a square rotated by `theta` will have half-extents of `s/2 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This is the correct formula for the AABB half-side for a square rotated by an arbitrary angle.
           Let `h_obj7 = 0.04795`.
           If `theta=pi/4` (`0.785398` rad), then `cos(pi/4) = sin(pi/4) = 0.70710678`.
           The effective half-extent of Object 7's AABB will be `0.04795 * (0.70710678 + 0.70710678) = 0.04795 * 1.41421356 = 0.06780`.
           Let's call this `h_7_eff`.
           The maximum displacement of object 7's center from the origin for its AABB to be within the surface is `0.135 - 0.06780 = 0.06720`.
           So if `theta=pi/4`, `abs(x_7)` must be `<= 0.06720` and `abs(y_7)` must be `<= 0.06720`.
           
           Now, check collision with object 4 (center `(0,0)`, half_size `0.04088`).
           To avoid collision, `abs(x_7)` must be `>= (h_7_eff + h_4)` OR `abs(y_7)` must be `>= (h_7_eff + h_4)`.
           `h_7_eff + h_4 = 0.06780 + 0.04088 = 0.10868`.
           Since the maximum `abs(x_7)` we can have is `0.06720`, which is much less than `0.10868`, it means that object 7, even when rotated at `pi/4`, will *still* collide with object 4.
           
           This implies that there is NO stable placement for object 7 on surface 0 if object 4 is at `(0,0)` and `theta=0`.
           Let's re-read the rules carefully. "You will be given feedback of whether a placement is stable and whether it collides with any of the fixed obstacles in the scene."
           And for non-fixed obstacles: "If you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene."
           
           Here, I am given a *new* object (ID 7) and must avoid *previously placed objects* (4, 5, 6). The problem is about finding a stable placement for the *new* object. It does not imply that previously placed objects are "non-fixed obstacles" that might move. They are already successfully placed. The only interpretation is that these are *fixed* in their current successful positions.
           This means my collision checks against objects 4, 5, and 6 are correct.
           
           My calculation shows that object 7, regardless of rotation, will collide with object 4 due to its size and the fixed position of object 4.
           This cannot be. There must be a valid placement. Is my understanding of the problem wrong?
           
           "The geometry of the object will be described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)."
           This sentence is tricky. It could mean `size_x` and `size_y` *are* the AABB dimensions, and rotations of the object *do not change its AABB*. This is common for simplified collision detection where the AABB is just a property, not derived from geometry. If so, then `theta` would only represent the object's visual orientation, not its collision geometry.
           If `size_x` and `size_y` *always* describe the AABB of the object regardless of its `theta`, then my original calculation for `theta=0` holds for all `theta`.
           
           Let's assume the AABB of object 7 is *always* `0.09590 x 0.09590` regardless of `theta`.
           Object 7 half_size: `0.04795`.
           Allowed center range: `x, y in [-0.08705, 0.08705]`.
           
           Collision with Object 4 (center `(0,0)`, half_size `0.04088`):
           Sum of half_sizes: `0.04088 + 0.04795 = 0.08883`.
           To avoid collision, `abs(x7)` must be `>= 0.08883` OR `abs(y7)` must be `>= 0.08883`.
           But `abs(x7)` and `abs(y7)` are limited to `0.08705`.
           This implies that *no placement is possible for object 7 if its AABB is fixed at `0.09590 x 0.09590` and object 4 is at `(0,0)`*.
           
           This is a critical issue. If my geometric reasoning is correct, then such a placement is impossible. However, the prompt says "You never give up. No matter how many times you fail... you will always try to find a new placement." This implies I *must* find a placement.
           
           Could it be that the success feedback means the object *didn't collide with fixed obstacles*, but *did* collide with the *other object* (which is not a fixed obstacle, it's a movable one, even if it has a chosen position)? No, the prompt says "whether it collides with any of the fixed obstacles in the scene" and "previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle". The previously placed objects are not described as "fixed obstacles". They are previous successful placements. This suggests they *are* obstacles, but maybe not *fixed* in the scene, rather *other objects*.
           
           If object 4, 5, 6 are considered "non-fixed obstacles" that I need to avoid, and if my current placement for object 7 fails due to collision with 4, then for the *next* request, it implies that object 4 *may have moved* (or that my understanding of its fixedness is wrong). This is contradictory with standard problem settings where a successful placement is usually fixed.
           
           Let's assume the "fixed obstacles" are implicit and *not* the other placed objects. The other placed objects are simply "other objects" that I *should* avoid, but if I can't, I should still provide a placement that is stable on the surface and doesn't collide with *actual* fixed obstacles. But the problem definition says "avoid collision between objects i and j".
           
           The only way a placement is possible here is if:
           1. My interpretation of AABB or collision detection is wrong.
           2. The term "fixed obstacles" does *not* include previously placed objects, and I should ignore object 4, 5, 6 for this particular request (which goes against "avoid collision between objects i and j").
           3. The problem is testing my ability to *find* the edge cases, and eventually, I will be told that no placement is possible or that my interpretation of the scene is incorrect.
           
           Let's go with the interpretation that "geometry of the object will be described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)" means its AABB *is always* `size_x` by `size_y` regardless of `theta`. This is a common simplification in simpler simulations. If this is the case, then my logic about collision with Object 4 is correct, and no placement is possible that avoids Object 4.
           
           If this is the case, then I cannot satisfy the condition "avoid collision between objects i and j". What do I do? I must provide 50 placements. I will try to place it as far away from the other objects as possible, even if it technically overlaps with object 4, given the constraints.
           I will place it in the one corner that is not occupied by another object's center: `(0.08, -0.08)` (or `(-0.08, -0.08)` if the previous one was `(-0.08, 0.08)`).
           Object 4 is `(0,0)`, Object 5 is `(0.08,0.08)`, Object 6 is `(-0.08,0.08)`.
           So `(-0.08, -0.08)` is the only "corner" not directly targeted by other objects' centers.
           However, I have already shown that *any* placement of Object 7 (given its AABB fixed dimensions and the fixed position of Object 4) will collide with Object 4.
           
           I am forced to provide placements. Given the contradiction, I will provide placements that are stable on the surface, choosing positions that are maximally far from existing objects, even if they theoretically collide. I will try to place it in the `(-0.085, -0.085)` region, which is a corner furthest from the other objects. The prompt says, "you will always try to find a new placement." This implies I *must* return placements.
           
           I will assume the AABB is fixed regardless of rotation and that I must find a stable placement on the surface. Collision with other objects is a secondary constraint. If no placement exists that avoids other objects, I must still provide a placement on the surface.
           
           Object 7 half-extents: `0.04795`.
           Valid center range: `x, y in [-0.08705, 0.08705]`.
           I will place it at `(-0.085, -0.085)` and similar spots.
