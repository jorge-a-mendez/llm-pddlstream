           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.19, 0.521)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.338, -0.529), (-4.244, -0.435)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.291, -0.482, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.233, 0.972).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Path to New Axiom**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially means getting a specific object, `v8`, onto a specific surface, `v18`, with the correct type. Since I already know the type of object `v8` (`type(v8, v17)` is given), I can focus on getting it onto the right surface. This boils down to achieving the condition `on(v8, v18)`.
           
           The crucial bit here is that something is "on" another thing if it's both supported by that thing *and* positioned at a particular pose. I've got a leg up because I already know `supported(v8, #p0, v18)` from the initial state, so the problem reduces to getting the object at `#p0` (where its supported).
           
           I know the robot, `v4`, is currently holding nothing and that `v8` is at pose `v9`.  My plan is to use the robot arm to pick up `v8` from pose `v9` and place it at the desired location, `#p0`. Since moving objects, especially heavy ones, between a robot and a surface requires two actions, picking the object from pose `v9` then placing it at the target pose `#p0`.
           
           To achieve this, I'll first need to move the robot base to a suitable configuration for grabbing `v8` which I've labeled `#q1`.  After the base is in position, I'll execute the `pick` action to grasp `v8`. Then, I'll need to move the base again, this time to a placement configuration which I've labeled `#q0`, so the robot arm can maneuver `v8` to `#p0` and execute the `place` action.
           
           The key to this plan working is ensuring the poses, configurations, and trajectories are valid.  For this, I need to make some assumptions about which actions will be valid.  The critical aspect is to select the right continuous values, particularly for `#p0`, and it's here that the analysis becomes most critical.  I have to find a pose for `v8` such that it lies on the bounding box `v18`. From the bounding boxes, I can see that object `v8` is smaller than the surface `v18`. Therefore, `#p0` must fit within the boundaries of `v18`, such as having the correct z-value. It is safe to assume the values are set to 0.8 to reflect it supporting a surface. The z-value of the continuous pose `#p0` will have a value to align with the supported bounding box. This is why I think I'll be able to successfully meet the goal.
           The steps:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  Move robot base `v3` to configuration `#q1` to be in position for `pick`.
           2.  **Pick:**  Use robot arm `v4` to pick up `v8` from `v9` and attach to `#g0`.
           3.  **Move Base Again:** Move base from `#q1` to `#q0`.
           4.  **Place:** Use arm to place `v8` at `#p0`.
           
           After the `place` action, the goal state should be met.  The values for the continuous poses, are now resolved for this plan to execute.
