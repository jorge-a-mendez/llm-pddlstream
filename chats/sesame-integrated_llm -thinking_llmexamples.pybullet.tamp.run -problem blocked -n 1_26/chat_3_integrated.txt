           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.196, 0.513)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.338, -0.529), (-4.244, -0.435)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.291, -0.482, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.233, 0.972).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've arrived at, breaking it down step-by-step:**
           
           The goal is to ensure `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true. I've identified `v12` as a potential object for `?green` because `type(v12, v17)` is already true in the initial state. The key is to get `v12` onto `v18`.
           
           **My analysis:**
           
           1.  **Understanding the Goal:** The `on` predicate needs to be true. From the given axiom, this means `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)` need to be true.  I can find `v12` in the initial state. I have `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` from the given facts, so it means `v12` must be at pose `#o2` on surface `v18`.  
           
           2.  **Using available actions**  The plan utilizes the `pick` and `place` actions because they are available for the specific object `v12` and can be used to set the current position to the destination position `atpose(v12, #o2)`.
           
           3.  **The Plan:**
               *   **Move Base:**  I start with a `move_base` action `v3 #o3 #o0` to move the robot base. Although I do not need to specify `x,y,z` for `#o3` because it is not a pose; it's a configuration. The system will figure out a valid one. I will provide a value for `#o2`.
               *   **Pick:** The `pick` action `v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4` picks `v12` from its current pose `v13`.
               *   **Place:** The `place` action `v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4` puts `v12` at pose `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           **Continuous Parameters:**
           
           *   I need to determine `#o2` which is the place location. It is a pose that needs to be collision-free. I've determined that a good location for `#o2` is `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`.
           
           **Key Assumptions and Reasoning:**
           
           *   I am assuming that the `kin` facts guarantee that a base configuration `#o3` *exists* that allows the robot to reach both `v13` (current position) and the target pose `#o2` using the given robot arm and grasps. This means I can pick and place with the same arm base configuration.
           *  Since I don't provide base configuration values, the system will determine these values. I will only provide values for a `#` pose.
           *   I can place the object `v12` onto the tabletop `v18` with no collisions because the pose `#o2` fits in the `v18`'s bounds.
           *   The system will handle details of collision avoidance because I don't have explicit information about the object's specific properties and collision modeling; also, the `kin` predicates *implicitly* handle this.
           
           **In summary, this plan, assuming that the system figures out and handles the specifics for arm base configurations, grasps, and trajectories, should successfully achieve the goal.**

           1.  **Understanding the Goal:** The `on` predicate needs to be true. From the given axiom, this means `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)` need to be true.  I can find `v12` in the initial state. I have `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` from the given facts, so it means `v12` must be at pose `#o2` on surface `v18`.  
           
           2.  **Using available actions**  The plan utilizes the `pick` and `place` actions because they are available for the specific object `v12` and can be used to set the current position to the destination position `atpose(v12, #o2)`.

               *   **Pick:** The `pick` action `v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4` picks `v12` from its current pose `v13`.
               *   **Place:** The `place` action `v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4` puts `v12` at pose `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           **Continuous Parameters:**
           
           *   I need to determine `#o2` which is the place location. It is a pose that needs to be collision-free. I've determined that a good location for `#o2` is `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`.

           *  Since I don't provide base configuration values, the system will determine these values. I will only provide values for a `#` pose.
           *   I can place the object `v12` onto the tabletop `v18` with no collisions because the pose `#o2` fits in the `v18`'s bounds.
