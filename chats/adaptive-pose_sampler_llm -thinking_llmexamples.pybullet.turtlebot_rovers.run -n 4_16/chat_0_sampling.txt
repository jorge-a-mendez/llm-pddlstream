User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Strategic Robot Base Placement for Target Acquisition**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding three good spots for a robot base to observe a target point, taking into account several constraints. The robot's facing will automatically adjust to the target, so that's easy. I need to be within a 2-meter radius of the target `(2.13, -1.97)`.  Importantly, I need to avoid collisions with any of the fixed obstacles, and consider the potential for them to *occlude* the target.  The base positions must also fall within the workspace boundaries: x and y both within `[-2.5, 2.5]`.
           
           First, I define my search space: the valid x range is roughly `[0.13, 2.5]` and the y range `[-2.5, 0.03]`.  However, there's a huge central wall at x=0.  Since the target is to the right of this wall, I need to ensure the robot base is also to the right. To stay well clear of this wall, I shift the x minimum to `0.3`, adding some margin for safety, assuming the robot is a point for collisions, but it probably has a radius. I decide on a robot radius of 0.25m.
           
           Now, within this restricted region, I have to contend with a couple of smaller obstacles.  I need to ensure no collisions and no occlusion. My goal is to find three diverse positions.
           
           Here's my approach: I'll try to find positions on the North, South, East, and West sides of the target. I'll test each potential position to make sure it's valid: within the 2-meter range, within the bounds `[-2.5, 2.5]`, and not colliding with any of the obstacles. I'll also carefully consider line-of-sight. If an obstacle sits in the direct line between the proposed robot base and the target, I must discard the position.
           
           **Position 1: South-West**
           
           I picked a point `(1.0, -2.0)`. It's within range and bounds and avoids collisions. The line of sight is clear of both smaller obstacles. This gives me a "low" option.
           
           **Position 2: North-East**
           
           I tried `(1.5, -0.1)`. This position is also within the rules. The line of sight is clear of both smaller obstacles. This one gives me an "above" view.
           
           **Position 3: North**
           
           Here I chose `(2.13, 0.0)`. This places the robot directly above the target but within the bounds. This offers a different vantage point, looking down on the target.
           
           All three positions are valid, relatively diverse, and seem to avoid collisions and line-of-sight occlusions.  I have taken into account the central wall, the 2-meter distance constraint, and the workspace limits. I will verify that all points will not be colliding, and that all lines of sight are not blocked. All three options seem viable to me.
