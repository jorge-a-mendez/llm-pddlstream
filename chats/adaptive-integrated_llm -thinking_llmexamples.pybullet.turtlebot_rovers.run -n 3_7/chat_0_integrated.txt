           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Unachievable Goal**
           
           My primary objective is to devise a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`. However, upon meticulously analyzing the goal's structure and the available actions, it's evident that the required conditions are not achievable within the current constraints. Specifically, the goal necessitates achieving several `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. These, in turn, depend on actions like `send_image` and `send_analysis`, which require prior actions such as `take_image` and `sample_rock`. The fundamental issue is that these crucial actions are explicitly *excluded* from the list of allowed action instances. Furthermore, the available 'move' actions are no-ops, implying that the rovers are stationary.  Given this restriction, no possible configuration change can satisfy the goal's requirements; as the required sensors cannot be deployed. Therefore, achieving the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently unfeasible.
