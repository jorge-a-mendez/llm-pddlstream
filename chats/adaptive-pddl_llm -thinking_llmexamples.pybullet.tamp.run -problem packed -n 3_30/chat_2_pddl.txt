           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Stacking**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is clear: to get objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto surface `v16`.  Essentially, to satisfy the `on(object, v16)` condition for each. It looks like everything is currently on `v11` and we have a target pose `#o2` defined on `v16`, that we'll need to hit. This will need to be broken down into steps.
           
           First, I need to understand the current state. We've got two arms, but only one is controllable, `v4`.  `v4` is currently empty.  The objects are graspable and stackable. The key is that objects are supported by surfaces at specific poses. My strategy is simple: I'll pick each object from its initial pose, and then place it on `v16` at the desired target pose, `#o2`. To make things smooth, I'll move the robot base to the correct configuration for these picks and places.
           
           Let's look at the plan:
           
           1.  **Base Movement:** Before picking up anything, I'll need to position the base to config `#o3` with `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`. This preps the robot for the subsequent manipulations.
           2.  **Object Manipulation:**  I'll start by picking `v12` up using arm `v4` from its current pose `v13` (supported by `v11`), then placing it onto the target pose `#o2` on `v16`. I'll repeat this for the `v8` from pose `v9`, then `v14` from pose `v15` onto surface `v16`, at pose `#o2`
           
           I'll use the available action instances for picking and placing with the provided grasps and kinematics. The sequence doesn't seem to matter for the target state. I've double checked for unsafe states but I see that there are no concerns there.  This approach will move each object independently to the final configuration without any collisions and should be quite direct. Let's execute this.
