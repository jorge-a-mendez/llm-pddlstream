           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Unreachable Goal: A Problem of Constraints and Actions**
           
           Okay, so the task is to get objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`. Specifically, I need to achieve the goals `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  The initial setup is clear: these objects are all currently on `v11`.  Critically, `v16` is a viable support surface, and there are specific poses for each object when they *are* on `v16`.  However, all three share the same target pose on `v16` (#o2).
           
           Looking at the initial state and the necessary preconditions for each goal clause, it boils down to matching the *current* poses of the objects (v9, v13, and v15, respectively) to the *required* poses (all #o2).  I quickly realized the severe limitation: the only action available is `move_base`. While it can update the 'canmove' predicate, it can't directly manipulate the `atpose` predicates I need to change. I'm essentially stuck because I *need* to adjust the object poses.
           
           The goal `on(v8, v16)` requires `atpose(v8, #o2)`.  Currently, I only have `atpose(v8, v9)`.  To change this, I'd need either a `pick` or a `place` action, as these are the only actions that affect `atpose`. But these actions are conspicuously absent from the available action instances. Given this severe limitation, the goal is simply unreachable.  There's no way to manipulate the objects to get them to their desired positions.
