           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.483, 2.112), (0.566, 2.196)).
           Object v5 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.623, -1.482), (0.751, -1.353)).
           Object v4 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.263, 1.284), (1.348, 1.369)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571)).
           Object v7 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.744, -1.648), (1.849, -1.542)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.821, -1.929), (1.187, -1.571)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.657, -0.596), (1.765, -0.488)).
           Object v3 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.066, -0.313), (1.157, -0.222)).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.869, 2.066), (-1.781, 2.153)).
           Object v9 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
           Object v15 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           Object v1 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.433, 1.046), (-0.353, 1.126)).
           Object v13 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis for `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, here's the situation: I've been tasked with planning to satisfy the goal defined by `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain. This axiom demands the satisfaction of several conditions: rovers at specific configurations, storage slots free, the receipt of images for two objectives, and the receipt of analyses for both a stone and soil sample.
           
           After carefully dissecting the axiom, I've noticed that some conditions (like rover positioning and free storage) are already true in the initial state, so no action is needed there. The real challenge lies in achieving `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` conditions.
           
           To receive an image, I would need to *take* and *send* the image. Achieving the `receivedanalysis` would need me to *sample* a rock, *analyze* it and *send* that information back.  However, here's the critical snag: the only allowed actions I'm permitted to use are a pair of `move` actions and a pair of `drop_rock` actions. Neither of these allowed actions can modify the state to make `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` true. The `drop_rock` actions would require the storage slots to be full, which isn't the case in the initial state, making them unusable immediately. The `move` actions, while theoretically valid in the setup, do nothing to help the overall goal state since the rovers are already in position.
           
           The `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, along with those that precede them, are the keys to achieving `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`. These actions aren't allowed in the plan. Thus, I must conclude that, given the strict constraints on the permissible actions, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently unachievable. No sequence of moves and rock drops can lead to the desired image and analysis receipt. This is due to the limited scope of the allowed actions given.
