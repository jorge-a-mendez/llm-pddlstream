           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.483, 2.112), (0.566, 2.196)).
           Object v5 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.623, -1.482), (0.751, -1.353)).
           Object v4 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.263, 1.284), (1.348, 1.369)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571)).
           Object v7 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.744, -1.648), (1.849, -1.542)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.821, -1.929), (1.187, -1.571)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.657, -0.596), (1.765, -0.488)).
           Object v3 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.066, -0.313), (1.157, -0.222)).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.869, 2.066), (-1.781, 2.153)).
           Object v9 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
           Object v15 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           Object v1 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.433, 1.046), (-0.353, 1.126)).
           Object v13 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **A Concise Plan to Achieve the New Axiom**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to satisfy this new axiom. It boils down to getting two images, `v17` and `v18`, sent to the lander, and ensuring we get analyses of a rock of type `v2` (that's `v1`, `v3`, or `v4`) and a rock of type `v6` (that's `v5`, `v7`, or `v8`) also received by the lander. The starting state gives us a solid foundation, some conditions are already true, and some objects are available. My first thought is: I need a robot to do the imaging and analysis. Then, the trick is that the rovers need to get back to their starting position. So, I will need some `drop` action at the right time.
           
           Let's break this down. The plan needs the images sent, and the analysis of two specific rocks sent to the lander. I see that the communication actions require the "haveimage" and "analyzed" precondtions.
           
           To get the images, I will have one rover, `v14`, handle getting and sending the images `v17` and `v18`. I'll have the same rover, to ensure the configuration for the communication is already known. Because `v14` has the needed camera, it needs to move to an image-taking location, calibrate the camera, take both images, move to the communication location, and send those images.
           
           For the rock analyses, I will have another rover, `v12`, sample the rock `v8`. The initial state has two conditions: `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`. The "free" condition is crucial because of the initial state. I cannot have both store values, because of the goal state.
           
           The core strategy then is:
           
           1.  **Preparation**
               *   Rover `v14` needs to be calibrated.
               *   Both rovers have to be `free`.
           
           2.  **Imaging**
               *   Rover `v14` moves to a specific point (`#o3`) so it can capture the images `v17` and `v18`.
               *   Rover `v14` calibrates its camera for `v17`, takes the image.
               *   Rover `v14` re-calibrates for `v18`, takes the image.
               *   Rover `v14` moves to a communication zone (`#o0`).
               *   Rover `v14` sends the images to the lander.
           
           3.  **Analysis**
               *   Rover `v14` gets to a position above rock `v1`. Rover `v1` is of type `v2`.
               *   Rover `v14` samples rock `v1`, then, it will be `full`.
               *   Rover `v14` moves to the communication zone `#o0`.
               *   Rover `v14` sends the sample.
               *   Rover `v14` *drops* the rock to become free.
               *   Rover `v14` returns to its initial configuration.
               *   Rover `v12` gets to a position above rock `v8`. Rover `v8` is of type `v6`.
               *   Rover `v12` samples rock `v8`, then it will be `full`.
               *   Rover `v12` moves to the communication zone `#o0`.
               *   Rover `v12` sends the sample.
               *   Rover `v12` *drops* the rock to become free.
               *   Rover `v12` returns to its initial configuration.
           
           **Continuous Parameters:**
           
           Now, for those annoying continuous parameters. The problem is a little ambiguous here; I *think* I only need to provide parameter values if their names are explicitly listed in the 'conf' of a comvisible or imagevisible. Since this is a PDDL domain, the poses (`#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`) are considered unique objects.
           
           *   `#o0` (communication zone, must be visible to the lander, and the rover can move to): Let's set it at `(-1.9, -1.75)`. This is suitable for both rovers to communicate with the lander.
           *   `#o3` (imaging zone, must be imageable to the targets): I'll make this `(0.0, 1.5)`. This should work for both rovers and both targets.

           The core strategy then is:
           
           1.  **Preparation**
               *   Rover `v14` needs to be calibrated.
               *   Both rovers have to be `free`.
           
           2.  **Imaging**
               *   Rover `v14` moves to a specific point (`#o3`) so it can capture the images `v17` and `v18`.
               *   Rover `v14` calibrates its camera for `v17`, takes the image.
               *   Rover `v14` re-calibrates for `v18`, takes the image.
               *   Rover `v14` moves to a communication zone (`#o0`).
               *   Rover `v14` sends the images to the lander.
           
           3.  **Analysis**
               *   Rover `v14` gets to a position above rock `v1`. Rover `v1` is of type `v2`.
               *   Rover `v14` samples rock `v1`, then, it will be `full`.
               *   Rover `v14` moves to the communication zone `#o0`.
               *   Rover `v14` sends the sample.
               *   Rover `v14` *drops* the rock to become free.
               *   Rover `v14` returns to its initial configuration.
               *   Rover `v12` gets to a position above rock `v8`. Rover `v8` is of type `v6`.
               *   Rover `v12` samples rock `v8`, then it will be `full`.
               *   Rover `v12` moves to the communication zone `#o0`.
               *   Rover `v12` sends the sample.
               *   Rover `v12` *drops* the rock to become free.
               *   Rover `v12` returns to its initial configuration.
           
           **Continuous Parameters:**
           
           Now, for those annoying continuous parameters. The problem is a little ambiguous here; I *think* I only need to provide parameter values if their names are explicitly listed in the 'conf' of a comvisible or imagevisible. Since this is a PDDL domain, the poses (`#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`) are considered unique objects.
           
           *   `#o0` (communication zone, must be visible to the lander, and the rover can move to): Let's set it at `(-1.9, -1.75)`. This is suitable for both rovers to communicate with the lander.
           *   `#o3` (imaging zone, must be imageable to the targets): I'll make this `(0.0, 1.5)`. This should work for both rovers and both targets.

(Thoughts: **Collision Resolution and Optimized Rover Plan**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The main issue here is the collisions reported in the previous configurations. I need to find new continuous values that don't collide with the lander (`v9`) or the wall (`v19`) while still being within the constraints of image range, communication range, and rover reachability. I'm focusing on two main configurations: `#o0` for communication and `#o3` for imaging.
           
           Based on the feedback, I need to reposition the imaging configuration and communication config. The previous config `#o0` was inside the lander's bounding box and `#o3` was in collision with `v19`. I will use the coordinates for these configurations and split these tasks, so each rover has a dedicated mission.
           
           *   **Obstacle Awareness:** The geometry includes the lander (`v9` at approximately `(-1.9, -2.0)`) and the wall (`v19` at `x=0`).
           
           *   **Communication with Lander (`#o0`):** I've chosen `(-1.3, -1.75)` as a common communication point for both rovers. This is outside the lander's bounding box and is accessible from both initial positions, ensuring a clear line of sight for communication and within the 4-meter communication range.
           
           *   **Imaging (`#o3`):** I'm splitting the imaging task. Rover `v14` will go to `(-1.0, 1.0)` to image `v17` (North-West) and Rover `v12` will go to `(0.5, 1.0)` to image `v18` (North-East). I made these selections to resolve the collision and get good visibility on both targets.
           
           *   **Simplified Plan:**
           
               *   **Rover `v14` (handles `v17` and rock `v1`):**
                   *   Move to image `v17` at `(-1.0, 1.0)`.
                   *   Calibrate.
                   *   Take image.
                   *   Move to the sampling location.
                   *   Sample Rock.
                   *   Move to communicate to `(-1.3, -1.75)`.
                   *   Send Image.
                   *   Send Analysis.
                   *   Drop.
                   *   Return to initial position.
           
               *   **Rover `v12` (handles `v18` and rock `v8`):**
                   *   Move to image `v18` at `(0.5, 1.0)`.
                   *   Calibrate.
                   *   Take image.
                   *   Move to the sampling location.

           The goal is to provide a working plan, and each `objective` must be completed. All distances are within the permissible constraints. The continuous parameters will now be linked to specific targets.

(Thoughts: **Updated Configuration Plan for Rover Navigation**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The previous configurations for communication and imaging caused some trouble. It seems the main issue is "reachability" from the rovers' current configurations, likely a combination of collision checks and pathfinding limitations.
           
           **Communication (`#o0`)**: I've decided to place the communication points at `(-1.2, -1.0)` for both rovers. This puts them near the lander (`v9`) but ensures they're clear of any collisions. It's a reasonable distance for communication (within 4m) and seems reachable from both starting positions `v15` for `v14` and `v13` for `v12`. I am hoping that their start positions enable these positions.
           
           **Imaging (`#o3`)**: For *imaging*, I'm going with `(-1.5, 0.5)` for `v14` (targeting `v17`) and `(0.8, 0.5)` for `v12` (targeting `v18`). These points are closer to the targets and clear of the wall. Although they are slightly further away (about 2.3m) from starting positions, I *hope* they are still considered "reachable". I'm relying on the assumption that a single move is possible within this distance.
           
           **Rock Analysis**: Since both rovers should be moving to their home bases, I need to make sure I satisfy the goal state and sample the correct rocks.
           
           **Revised Plan**:
           *   **Rover `v14`**:
               1.  Move to imaging config `#o3 (-1.5, 0.5)` to view `v17`.
               2.  Calibrate and image `v17`.
               3.  Move to `#o5` for `v1` sampling.
               4.  Sample `v1`.
               5.  Move to communication config `#o0 (-1.2, -1.0)`.
               6.  Send image and analysis to the lander.
               7.  Return to starting config `v15`.
           *   **Rover `v12`**:
               1.  Move to imaging config `#o3 (0.8, 0.5)` to view `v18`.
               2.  Calibrate and image `v18`.
               3.  Move to `#o5` for `v8` sampling.
               4.  Sample `v8`.
               5.  Move to communication config `#o0 (-1.2, -1.0)`.
               6.  Send image and analysis to the lander.
               7.  Return to starting config `v13`.
           
           The core focus is ensuring that the chosen configurations for communication and imaging are "reachable". The distance to both of these points may be an issue, though it seems reasonable and valid based on the distance thresholds. I am also aware that the communication setup requires line of sight, so I also need to make sure that the robots are able to establish the connection from these positions.
           
           These new coordinates keep the plan clean, reduce chances of collision, and maintain the needed line of sight. Now, it's about seeing if the system accepts these moves as reachable. I am concerned about the distance to reach the `imaging` positions, but will re-evaluate if the task fails.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating Continuous Configurations for Rover Tasks**
           
           Given the constraints and feedback, I'm now focusing on finding collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable continuous configurations for communication (`#o0`) and imaging (`#o3`) tasks, along with determining the best sampling points.
           
           **Core Assumptions & Initial State:** Rovers `v12` and `v14` start at their respective configurations (`v13` and `v15`).  `v9` (lander) is the communication target, `v17` and `v18` are imaging targets, `v19` is the central wall obstacle, and `v1` and `v8` are rock sample locations.  Both rovers must return to their initial configurations (`v13` and `v15`).  The system also requires analysis and imaging data to be sent to `v9`.
           
           **Communication Configuration (`#o0`) Strategy:**
           I need to find locations for each rover to communicate with the lander (`v9`). The key challenge is `v19`. I've determined that rover `v14` (west side) can communicate with `v9` at approximately `(-1.0, -2.0)`. Similarly, rover `v12` (east side) will use a location of `(1.0, -1.0)`.  These choices minimize distance, and based on the height of the wall, seem to allow the communication.
           
           **Imaging Configuration (`#o3`) Strategy:**
           For imaging targets, I have calculated new coordinates which minimize the distance for each rover. Rover `v14` will go to `(-1.0, 1.0)` and image `v17`. Rover `v12` moves to `(0.7, 1.0)` and images `v18`. These distances, while on the edge of reachability, appear to allow imaging without collision, and are within range for the sensor.
           
           **Sampling Configuration & Plan:**
           The `#o5` variable is a continuous value that will be filled in, but for the plan, I am assuming the following: Rover `v14` will take rock samples from `v1`. Rover `v12` will take soil samples from `v8`. The plan will proceed in the described sequence as usual: image, sample, communicate, return.
           
           **Verification and Reachability Check:** I have double-checked the reachability to make sure the paths are short enough. Given the rover's initial positions, sampling positions, and the new proposed continuous configuration coordinates for communication and imaging, I must check for occlusion and the system's "blocked" predicate. I am assuming the rover has a good line-of-sight to the communication and imaging locations, and that the distances between each point in the sequence will not exceed maximum reachability constraints. The key is to satisfy `comvisible`, `imagevisible` and avoid collisions.

Model:     **Re-evaluating Continuous Configurations for Rover Tasks**
           
           Given the constraints and feedback, I'm now focusing on finding collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable continuous configurations for communication (`#o0`) and imaging (`#o3`) tasks, along with determining the best sampling points.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Repositioning for Success in the Rovers Domain**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan, based on those "not reachable" rejections. It's clear that direct moves to image and communicate were hitting a distance or occlusion snag. We need to be more strategic about placement, using the given `motion` primitives efficiently.
           
           The key is this "reachable" constraint, which seems incredibly tight. I suspect it's about staying within a 2-meter radius for a single `move` action.
           
           The objective (`new-axiom@0()`) requires imaging, analysis, and communication, along with rover repositioning. The key, based on those "not reachable" errors, has to be the values I provide for those configurations prefixed with `#`. I *must* define them, and the system needs to find a collision-free and line-of-sight trajectory. That also means `motion` primitives cover *all* allowed intermediate configurations. This means that I can *stage* my move, to avoid long distances between moves.
           
           I'll proceed with the following strategy:
           
           1. **West Rover (`v14`):**
               *   **Image `v17`**:
                   *   Initial Position: `(-1.0, -1.75)` (Rover `v14`)
                   *   Target: `#o3 = (-1.2, 0.2)`. Reachable from initial position (`1.96m`).
                   *   Image Target: Center of `v17` `(-1.8, 2.1)`: `1.99m` from target - within range.
                   *   Free from `v19` : `x = -1.2` is safe.
               *   **Communicate with `v9`:**
                   *   Rover position: `#o0 = (-1.0, -1.5)`. Reachable from initial position (`0.25m`).
                   *   From #o0 to v9: comm range is within bounds (`1.03m`).
               *   Rover is clear of obstacle `v19`.
           
           2.  **East Rover (`v12`):**
               *   **Image `v18`**:
                   *   Target `#o3 = (0.8, 0.2)`. Reachable: `1.96m`.
                   *   Image Target: Center of `v18` `(0.52, 2.15)`: `1.97m`.
               *   **Communicate with `v9`:**
                   *   Rover position:  `#o0 = (0.5, -1.5)` (Reachable: `0.56m`)
                   *   From #o0: Communication is achievable - distance check. (`2.45m` - within 4m range.)
               *   Rover is clear of obstacle `v19`.
           
           This plan aims to respect the critical reachable-distance and visibility constraints within single moves. The `motion` primitives should hopefully guide these movements towards success.

(Thoughts: **Rethinking Reachability and Constraints**
           
           Okay, so I've been getting feedback that the continuous configurations I'm suggesting for communication (`#o0`) and imaging (`#o3`) are "not reachable." This is a tricky one. My initial assumption was that "reachable" meant the robot base could directly *move* to that configuration using the provided `move` action. But clearly, that's not the whole story.
           
           I'm starting to think that either my interpretation of "reachable" is too broad, or there are tighter, unstated constraints on the `move` action. Are there implicit limitations on the distance the robot can travel in a single move? Maybe it's a very short range, and the plan needs to string together multiple moves to get anywhere significant. 
           
           Looking at the `motion` predicates, it seems they describe valid moves *between* these continuous configurations, which suggests that the problem *should* be solvable. It's my chosen coordinates for `#o0` and `#o3` that are the issue, not the existence of such a motion. I've got to find the *right* values for those continuous parameters.
           
           **The Setup and Constraints:**
           
           I'm aiming to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which means gathering image data and analysis results from stone and soil samples.
           
           Here's the layout:
           *   Obstacle: a wall at `x=0`.
           *   Lander (`v9`) on the west side.
           *   My rovers: `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)` and `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           *   Objectives: `v17` (NW, imaging range 2m), and `v18` (NE, imaging range 2m).
           *   Rocks: `v1` (stone, type `v2`) and `v8` (soil, type `v6`).
           
           **The "Reachable" Conundrum**
           
           If the system *says* a configuration is unreachable, even when the `motion` predicates exist, I have to assume the allowed move distance for a single `move` is very small. Let's start with a really conservative estimate of 1m or less. 
           
           The initial coordinates were too far, so I'm thinking I need to keep these configurations *extremely* close to the starting positions. But, imaging targets are a good distance away north. I'm hitting a contradiction here. The given `motion` fact *must* mean that paths exist. So, the coordinates are wrong.
           
           **Re-evaluating "Reachable" and the Obstacle**
           
           Is the problem a misunderstanding of what "reachable" means in this context, or are my distance estimates incorrect?
           
           I'm thinking of "reachable" as the straight path, but is there *another* interpretation? Maybe "reachable" means that it's possible to reach those positions with a few moves?
           
           I'm worried about the obstacle `v19` at `x=0`. Does this wall block visibility between configurations?
           
           **New Approach and Coordinates**
           
           Since the distances are problematic, I will make the configurations *extremely* close to the initial position and check if the imaging/communication can still be done from there, to check the lower bound of 'reachable' for me.
           
           Rover `v14`: at `v15=(-1.0, -1.75)`
           -   `#o0` (Comms)  `(-1.0, -1.7)` Distance to `v9` should be valid.
           -   `#o3` (Imaging):  `(-1.0, 1.0)`
           Rover `v12`: at `v13=(1.0, -1.75)`
           -   `#o0` (Comms)  `(1.0, -1.7)`
           -   `#o3` (Imaging):  `(1.0, 1.0)`
           
           I am keeping them extremely close to starting positions. If it's a valid solution, that would explain "reachable".
           
           **Final Thoughts and Strategy**
           
           I'm working under the assumption that the `motion` predicates define reachability, and "not reachable" indicates problems with my chosen coordinates, the geometry, or those path constraints. If this final set of coordinate attempts fail, then the problem is structured in a way that is unsolvable for me.
           
           The plan is to try these new coordinates, keeping everything *close*, and see if it works. If it still doesn't, I will consider the problem unsolvable.
