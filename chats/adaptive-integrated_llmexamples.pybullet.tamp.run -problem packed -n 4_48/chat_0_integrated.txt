User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.213, 0.498), (-0.116, 0.594)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.188, 0.337), (-0.103, 0.422)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.114, 0.33), (0.19, 0.406)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.26, -0.384), (-0.179, -0.304)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.164, 0.546, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.962, -0.274).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.146, 0.38, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.617, 0.787).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.152, 0.368, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.046, 0.999).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.219, -0.344, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.764, 0.645).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is to place all objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) on the surface v18.
           Looking at the initial state, all objects are currently supported by v11.
           Specifically:
           - v8 is at v9 on v11
           - v12 is at v13 on v11
           - v14 is at v15 on v11
           - v16 is at v17 on v11
           
           There are also facts that state:
           - supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           - supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           - supported(v14, #o2, v18)
           - supported(v16, #o2, v18)
           
           This means that all objects can be placed at the same pose #o2 on the surface v18. Since the goal is to place all objects on v18, and we have a common target pose #o2 that is supported for all objects on v18, we can use this single pose to achieve the goal. However, since they are different objects, they will need different collision-free placements on v18.
           
           First, we need to pick up each object from its initial location and then place it on v18 at different positions within #o2. The only available arm is v4, and it is at aconf v5 and handempty. We don't have enough information on kin and collision-free predicates to form a detailed plan with pick and place operations, as there are no such action instances available in the provided list. The only action available is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, which just moves the base from v3 to v3 (effectively staying in the same place) and doesn't help with picking and placing objects.
           
           Since there are no pick or place actions in the available action instances, and no kin facts that would allow us to infer any pick or place actions, it is impossible to achieve the goal of moving objects. Therefore, the goal is unreachable given the current set of available action instances.
