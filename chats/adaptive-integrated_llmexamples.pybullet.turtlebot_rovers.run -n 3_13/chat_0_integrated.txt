           Object v1 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.668, -1.309), (1.761, -1.216)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, two configurations for them, v13 and v15 respectively, and a camera, v10, capable of supporting mode v11. There are several objectives (v17, v18, v19) and rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8). There's also a lander (v9) to send data to, and a store (v16) for samples.
           
           The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which, when expanded, means:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: Both rovers are at their initial configurations. This is true initially.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: Both rovers' stores are free. This is true initially.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: Images of objectives v17, v18, and v19 in mode v11 have been received.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: A rock of type v2 has been analyzed and the analysis received.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: A rock of type v6 has been analyzed and the analysis received.
           
           Let's break down how to achieve the goal:
           
           **1. Received Images:**
              - To achieve `receivedimage`, the rover needs to `take_image` and then `send_image`.
              - `take_image` requires the camera to be `calibrated`. So, first `calibrate`.
              - Rover v12 and v14 have `imagevisible` predicates for all three objectives (v17, v18, v19) at configuration `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
              - Both rovers are at their initial configurations (v13 and v15 respectively) and the imagevisible predicates specify they are at `#o3`. However, the initial state also says `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`. Since `#o3` and v13/v15 are different configuration symbols, if we want to take images from `#o3`, the rovers would need to `move` there. But the only move actions allowed are moving from v13 to v13 and v15 to v15, which are self-moves and don't change the configuration. This means we must assume that `#o3` effectively refers to the current configurations v13 and v15, or that the system implicitly handles this if the coordinates are the same. Since the problem statement states "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state... then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration", and `#o3` has `conf(v12, #o3)` and `conf(v14, #o3)` in the initial state, we would need to specify a configuration for `#o3`. However, to minimize new configurations and since the current configurations are at v13 and v15, and the move actions only allow self-moves, we should prioritize using the current configurations. Given the available actions, we cannot actually move to `#o3` if it's different from v13/v15. The problem statement says "If there are sufficient configurations without '#' to solve the problem, you should use those configurations instead of any with '#'.". So, let's assume `#o3` is compatible with the current location or the given `imagevisible` implies the current location. Also, the `blocked(#o4)` needs to be false. Since it's not present, it's false.
           
              Let's check `calibrate` and `take_image` for rover v12.
              - `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)` (and for v18, v19)
              - `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)` (and for v18, v19)
              Then `send_image`.
              - `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)` (and for v18, v19)
              - Similar actions can be done by v14.
           
           **2. Received Analysis:**
              - We need to analyze a rock of `type v2` and a rock of `type v6`.
              - To achieve `receivedanalysis`, the rover needs to `sample_rock` and then `send_analysis`.
              - `sample_rock` requires the rover to be `above` the rock and have a `free` store.
              - `send_analysis` requires the rover to have `analyzed` the rock.
           
              Rocks of type v2: v1, v3, v4.
              Rocks of type v6: v5, v7, v8.
           
              Rover v12 has `above(v12, #o5, v1)`, `above(v12, #o5, v3)`, `above(v12, #o5, v4)`, `above(v12, #o5, v5)`, `above(v12, #o5, v7)`, `above(v12, #o5, v8)`.
              Rover v14 has `above(v14, #o5, v1)`, `above(v14, #o5, v3)`, `above(v14, #o5, v4)`, `above(v14, #o5, v5)`, `above(v14, #o5, v7)`, `above(v14, #o5, v8)`.
              Again, `#o5` is a configuration. Similar to `#o3`, we assume it's compatible with the current location or we provide a new configuration.
              Since `conf(v12, #o5)` and `conf(v14, #o5)` exist, we'll need to define it.
           
              Let's use rover v12 to sample a type v2 rock (e.g., v1) and a type v6 rock (e.g., v5).
              - `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v1, v16)` (This will make v12's store `full(v12, v16)`).
              - `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v1)`
              To sample another rock (v5), the store must be `free`. So we need to `drop_rock` first.
              - `drop_rock(v12, v16)`
              - `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v5, v16)`
              - `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v5)`
           
           Given the constraints that we cannot move the rovers to new configurations and the initial state already defines `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`, we must use v13 and v15 as the configuration for `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. However, the `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` predicates explicitly use `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5` respectively. This means these continuous parameters must be defined at the rovers' current location. For simplicity and to satisfy the problem statement, we will use v13 for rover v12 and v15 for rover v14 as the configurations when dealing with these actions. The rays `#o4` and `#o1` will also need to be defined.
           
           Let's assume `#o3` for `imagevisible` refers to the rover's current configuration (v13 for v12, v15 for v14).
           Let's assume `#o0` for `comvisible` refers to the rover's current configuration (v13 for v12, v15 for v14).
           Let's assume `#o5` for `above` refers to the rover's current configuration (v13 for v12, v15 for v14).
           
           This is a critical assumption given the provided `move` actions do not allow changing configurations.
           
           Plan:
           1. Rover v12 calibrates its camera for objective v17, takes an image of v17, and sends it.
           2. Rover v12 calibrates its camera for objective v18, takes an image of v18, and sends it.
           3. Rover v12 calibrates its camera for objective v19, takes an image of v19, and sends it.
           4. Rover v12 samples rock v1 (type v2).
           5. Rover v12 sends the analysis of rock v1.
           6. Rover v12 drops rock v1.
           7. Rover v12 samples rock v5 (type v6).
           8. Rover v12 sends the analysis of rock v5.
           
           This achieves all parts of `new-axiom@0()`:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are true (no moves happen).
           - `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: v12 store becomes full then free. v14's remains free.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)` are achieved.
           - `receivedanalysis(v1)` (type v2) and `receivedanalysis(v5)` (type v6) are achieved.

           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The previous plan was invalid because it included actions not present in the provided list of valid action instances. The only allowed actions are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`, `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`, `(drop_rock v12 v16)`, and `(drop_rock v14 v16)`.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the goal `new-axiom@0()` given these extremely limited actions:
           
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: These are true in the initial state and are maintained by the self-`move` actions.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: These are true in the initial state. The `drop_rock` actions would be used if the stores became full, but the provided actions do not allow sampling rocks to make them full.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: There are no `take_image`, `calibrate`, or `send_image` actions allowed. Therefore, these cannot be achieved unless they are already true. Examining the initial state, they are *not* true.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: There are no `sample_rock` or `send_analysis` actions allowed. Therefore, this cannot be achieved unless it is already true. Examining the initial state, it is *not* true.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: Same as above, not true and cannot be achieved.
           
           Given that the goal requires actions like `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` which are only achievable through `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`, and none of these actions are in the provided list of *valid action instances*, the goal is unreachable. The `move` actions are self-moves and do not change the state meaningfully for the goal, and `drop_rock` is only relevant if a rock has been sampled, which is also impossible.
