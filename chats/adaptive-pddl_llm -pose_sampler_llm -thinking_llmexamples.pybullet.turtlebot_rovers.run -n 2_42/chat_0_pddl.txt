User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**
           
           Alright, the task is clear. I need to find 25 valid robot base positions for a given target point, considering various constraints. First, the robot's base must be within a maximum distance of 4 units from the target point and confined to the scene limits: x from -2.5 to 2.5, y from -2.5 to 2.5. However, there are also fixed obstacles and the possibility of other non-fixed obstacles to avoid. Furthermore, the robot's orientation will automatically adjust to face the target.
           
           I've examined the layout and noted key features. The outer walls define a square room, and I've analyzed the locations of fixed obstacles, especially internal ones. The most critical obstacle is the vertical wall at x=0, effectively splitting the scene. The target location, which I see to be in the left half, is (-1.946, -0.187), and this influences my strategy. The x=0 wall means the robot needs to be on the same side or able to view over.
           
           The target is located to the left of the x=0 wall, so the robot's x coordinate should be in this region, thus, x will generally be smaller than 0. The internal obstacles also need careful consideration, and I've reviewed each. Obstacle 13, located just below the target, is especially concerning because it creates a potential occlusion problem.
           
           **Defining the Search Space and Constraints**
           
           Based on this, the x-range should be from -2.45 to -0.05, and the y-range should be from -2.45 to 2.45 to remain within the walls. This is also restricted by the constraint of being within a distance of 4 units from the target.
           
           Now, I'll need to develop a reliable and efficient way of generating candidate positions, then I'll use filtering. I plan to use the is_valid_point() function, and I'll carefully manage point density around areas where obstacles exist, particularly near the critical Obstacle 13.
           
           **Strategy for Point Generation**
           
           To ensure diversity and cover the relevant space, I'll use a mixed approach, sampling points at various distances and angles from the target. The main strategy is to generate points in a circular pattern around the target point. I plan to test a grid approach within the valid bounds, then to generate points in a circular fashion with varying radii and angles. The angles will be carefully selected to prioritize locations around the target point, and they will be filtered for locations that pass obstacle collisions and boundary checks using my is_valid_point() function.
           
           I have thoroughly examined the code and will perform a validation test on an example point to make sure that the is_valid_point() function is correct. I have added the most relevant obstacles to a list to check collision. This approach is systematic and should produce a sufficiently diverse and obstacle-free set of candidate positions. I will shuffle this set and then select the first 25.
           
           **Implementation Details and Refinement**
           
           For the actual implementation, I'll create a list of obstacles and create a list of valid candidate points. The generation will work through a sampling routine. I'll test the validity of each candidate point against all constraints (distance, boundary, and obstacle presence) using the `is_valid_point()` function.
           
           If needed, I can refine the angle and radii choices, but I think the mix chosen will ensure a good coverage of the area. For any point that does not meet the specified constraints or falls within an obstacle's bounding box, I'll discard it. If there are fewer than 25 valid positions, I can adjust the sampling strategy.
