           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Unreachable Due to Action Constraints**
           
           My task is to devise a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain. After analyzing the goal definition, I broke it down into subgoals: acquiring images of four objectives, receiving analysis of a stone and soil sample, and ensuring that two rovers are at specific configurations with free storage.
           
           I then carefully examined the initial state of the world to determine the current status of these subgoals. I found that the initial state satisfies many of the preconditions, specifically those related to rover locations and storage availability. The challenge lies in achieving the subgoals related to image acquisition and analysis.
           
           The plan involves using rover `v14` for imaging all four objectives and both rovers to collect and send samples. To capture images, I need to perform a series of steps: calibrate the camera, take an image, and send the image. Similarly, for analysis, I need to sample a rock, and then send it.
           
           However, a crucial constraint arises: I'm only allowed to use action instances provided in a given list. These actions are only `move` and `drop_rock`. This is where the plan breaks down. The required actions—*calibrate*, *take_image*, *send_image*, *sample_rock*, and *send_analysis*—are *not* in the permitted action list.
           
           Without the necessary actions to achieve image acquisition and analysis, the goal becomes inherently unattainable. Therefore, based on the given constraints, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable.
