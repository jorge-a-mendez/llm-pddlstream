(Thoughts: **Fulfilling the Request for 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My primary goal is to generate 50 stable and valid placements for an object (ID 5) on a given surface. This surface is a square of dimensions 0.27m x 0.27m centered at (0, 0), as defined by the coordinates (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). The object in question is also square, with dimensions 0.08679m x 0.08679m. Since this is the first request for this surface, there is no need to avoid collisions with any other objects.
           
           A valid placement `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)` requires that:
           
           *   `surf_idx` is 0, since only the first surface is considered.
           *   The object's AABB, when rotated by an angle `theta`, must remain entirely within the surface boundaries.
           
           To ensure this, I need to account for the object's rotation. While a square appears the same at rotations of 0, pi/2, pi, and 3pi/2, the object's AABB changes when the object is rotated by other angles. The side length of the AABB is therefore `L = 0.08679 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. The maximum `L` occurs at a 45-degree angle, but even then, the rotated object's AABB comfortably fits within the surface.
           
           I've decided to employ a strategy where I vary both the rotation angle `theta` and the center position `(x, y)` of the object to create diverse valid placements. I specifically selected ten distinct `theta` values, spanning a range of 0 to `pi/2 + pi/16`, in such a manner that gives a wide range of different `L` values. For each `theta`, I then place the object at five different `(x, y)` positions: the center of the surface, and at the centers of each edge along its AABB boundaries (Top, Bottom, Left, Right). The magnitude for this boundary comes from calculating `0.135 - L/2`. This systematic generation ensures full coverage of the surface.
           
           My code efficiently produces this requested set of 50 placements.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements**
           
           Alright, I've got a new object (ID 4) to place on Surface 0, and I need to ensure it doesn't collide with the existing object (ID 5).  ID 5 is already placed at (0, 0, 0, 0), and I've got its AABB calculated.  Now, ID 4 is a square with side length *w4*, and the surface is a rectangle. My goal is to generate 50 stable, collision-free placements for ID 4, which means I need to avoid any overlap between the AABB of object 4 and object 5.
           
           First, I need to know the dimensions of the rectangular object so I need to find the bounding box size depending on the rotation angle. Then I'm calculating L4 at different angle values. I need to take into account the size of object 4, the bounds of the surface, and, crucially, the collision exclusion zone around object 5. I determined that some angles make it impossible to avoid collision at all.
           
           To avoid a collision, the center of ID 4 must stay outside an "exclusion zone" created by ID 5, expanded by half of ID 4's bounding box side length.  The tricky part is that the exclusion zone size depends on the rotation angle of ID 4.  The safe area is outside this zone.
           
           I've decided to test angles close to zero, because at angles close to multiples of pi/2, the object is most easily placed. I calculated a collision free boundary based on the L4 value. If the maximum coordinate of the object's center is greater than the collision free boundary then the position is valid.
           
           I'll iterate through several angles near zero radians and generate multiple candidate placements for each. I'm focusing on edge placements and I'm spacing out the positions appropriately, for a diverse distribution.
           
           For each angle I'll check a small section on the x-axis and y-axis on the rectangular surface, spacing out the placements.
           
           This way, I can ensure that all generated points will be non-colliding and well within the bounds of Surface 0.

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning for Stable Object Placements**
           
           My primary goal is to determine 50 safe, stable placements for a new, square object (ID 7) on Surface 0, ensuring it doesn't collide with the existing objects (ID 5 and ID 4) on that surface. Surface 0 is a square region centered at (0,0).
           
           I’ve meticulously analyzed the characteristics of all objects. Object 5, also square, is centered at (0,0), and has a known AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of `[-0.043395, 0.043395]` x `[-0.043395, 0.043395]`. Object 4, another square, is centered at approximately (0.088018815, 0.0) with half-dimensions of 0.042266325. This gives an AABB of `[0.04575249, 0.13028514]` x `[-0.042266325, 0.042266325]`. The new object (ID 7) is also square.
           
           To avoid collisions, I need to ensure that the AABB of object 7, regardless of its rotation, doesn't overlap with the AABBs of objects 4 and 5. I calculated the AABB side length (L7) of the new object as a function of its rotation angle, theta. I then computed the maximum extent and the minimum safe distance needed from each object to avoid collision for the new object.
           
           I determined that rotation angles near 0 and pi/2 are preferable to minimizing AABB sizes. I’m focusing on angles 0.0, 0.05, 0.1 radians near zero. The remaining 2 angles are close to pi/2.
           
           For each selected theta, I calculated the minimum required distance of object 7's center from the centers of objects 5 and 4. The y-distance is from object 5 centered at (0,0) and the x and y distances from object 4 are from the AABB of object 4. I divided the Surface 0 into three horizontal regions (top, bottom, and center) and three vertical regions (left, right, and center).
           
           I determined y-values outside of `(-0.08579, 0.08579)` ensure non-collision with Object 5; if Object 7 x position is near Object 4, additional y-distance to avoid Object 4 is needed. The x region of overlap around Object 4, which is in the x-range `(0.005345, 0.09459)`.
           
           With this knowledge, I strategically generated 50 placements to ensure no overlaps and to respect surface boundaries.

(Thoughts: **The Placement Predicament: A Deep Dive**
           
           Okay, so I've got this new object, ID 6, that needs to find a happy home on surface 0. My initial thought? Avoid the existing furniture (IDs 5, 4, and 7) at all costs! Seems straightforward, right? Well, the plot thickens.
           
           The surface is a nice square, 0.27m on each side, centered at (0,0). Simple enough. Object 6 is a square, and I'm aiming for 50 stable placements. I figured "Stable" means fully within the surface and not overlapping anything else.
           
           The initial plan was to calculate the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of each object and then make sure the new object's AABB wouldn't intersect. I was looking at Object 5's position (center at (0,0)), Object 4 (shifted right), and Object 7 (shifted up and left). With the existing objects and a new object needing space, the surface is becoming quite crowded.
           
           I calculated the object 6's AABB size with rotations. Turns out, rotating the object changes its footprint. Minimum AABB size is the object's width (0.094m) and the max with diagonal (0.133m). I then defined the permissible area for object 6, considering the AABB's center. For `theta = 0` the max center is `0.088`.
           However, it's quickly becoming apparent that things are tighter than I expected.
           
           Next, I looked at the AABBs of the existing objects. I calculated those forbidden zones and the remaining open space for object 6. Then I defined those occupied regions:
           *   Region 5 (Object 5): `X5 = [-0.043395, 0.043395]`, `Y5 = [-0.043395, 0.043395]`
           *   Region 4 (Object 4): `X4 = [0.045752, 0.130285]`, `Y4 = [-0.042266, 0.042266]`
           *   Region 7 (Object 7): `X7 = [-0.129407, -0.048593]`, `Y7 = [0.046992, 0.127806]`
           It looks like the remaining space for placing object 6 is getting quite limited, due to the placement of other objects.
           
           My first idea was to try `theta = 0`. With that, the new object's AABB dimensions are fixed, making the calculations easier. So the maximum center coordinate for the new object is at `x=0.088`, and I calculated the collision bounds, the `x` and `y` center coordinates must satisfy that.
           I defined the collision regions. Collision with Object `k` exists when the new object's x-AABB `and` y-AABB both overlap with that of object `k`. I defined for each object the allowed region, and the forbidden region for `x` and `y`.
           I needed to avoid collision, thus avoiding all forbidden regions.
           
           The problem here is that with that size of object 6, even if I place it with `theta = 0`, it will collide with Object 5 almost everywhere. It's almost impossible to place it at all!
           
           If I require strict AABB non-overlap, there are *no* valid placements. The constraints made it such that all surface-contained placements are forbidden.  With an `h=0.047019`, any position on the surface will collide, since `|x| <= 0.087981`, and `|y| <= 0.087981`. I cannot place the new object entirely outside. So, the x and y ranges overlap, collision is unavoidable.
           
           Even for the top-right corner, because of Object 4, which is in the way.
           The same goes with the other objects' positions. They occupy the space, and it's almost impossible to avoid them and fit in a similar-sized new object.
           So now I have a dilemma: The requirements of non-overlap cannot be satisfied! What to do?
           
           I need to make an assumption here. Maybe `avoid collision` means `avoid full containment of one object in another`, or some other non-strict definition, or it's a test case, and no placements are possible. However, the task specifically states "Please return 50 stable placements...

           My first idea was to try `theta = 0`. With that, the new object's AABB dimensions are fixed, making the calculations easier. So the maximum center coordinate for the new object is at `x=0.088`, and I calculated the collision bounds, the `x` and `y` center coordinates must satisfy that.
           I defined the collision regions. Collision with Object `k` exists when the new object's x-AABB `and` y-AABB both overlap with that of object `k`. I defined for each object the allowed region, and the forbidden region for `x` and `y`.
           I needed to avoid collision, thus avoiding all forbidden regions.
           
           The problem here is that with that size of object 6, even if I place it with `theta = 0`, it will collide with Object 5 almost everywhere. It's almost impossible to place it at all!
           
           If I require strict AABB non-overlap, there are *no* valid placements. The constraints made it such that all surface-contained placements are forbidden.  With an `h=0.047019`, any position on the surface will collide, since `|x| <= 0.087981`, and `|y| <= 0.087981`. I cannot place the new object entirely outside. So, the x and y ranges overlap, collision is unavoidable.
           
           Even for the top-right corner, because of Object 4, which is in the way.
           The same goes with the other objects' positions. They occupy the space, and it's almost impossible to avoid them and fit in a similar-sized new object.
           So now I have a dilemma: The requirements of non-overlap cannot be satisfied! What to do?
           
           I need to make an assumption here. Maybe `avoid collision` means `avoid full containment of one object in another`, or some other non-strict definition, or it's a test case, and no placements are possible. However, the task specifically states "Please return 50 stable placements...
