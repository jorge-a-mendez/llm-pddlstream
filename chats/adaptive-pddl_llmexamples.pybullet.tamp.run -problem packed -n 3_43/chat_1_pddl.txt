               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes three graspable objects, v12, v8, and v14, currently at specific poses on an unknown receptacle. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, both currently handempty. The goal is to move all three objects (v8, v12, and v14) onto the receptacle v16.
           
           From the initial state, the objects v8, v12, and v14 are currently at poses v9, v13, and v15 respectively, and all are supported by v11. The goal requires them to be on v16. The available kinemtaics show that arm v4 can pick up each of these objects and place them at pose #o2, which can be supported by v10 or v16. The only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which moves the robot from configuration v3 to v3, using trajectory #o0. This action essentially doesn't change the base configuration and also consumes the `canmove()` predicate. However, the problem statement says that any action not listed is not allowed to be used, meaning that pick and place actions, though defined, are not available in this instance, because no valid instances are provided for them.
           
           Since no `pick` or `place` action instances are provided, and the goal requires moving objects, which can only be achieved by `pick` and `place` actions, the goal is unreachable.
           
           The `on` predicate is an axiom `on(?o: object, ?r: object) <- supported(?o, ?p, ?r) AND atpose(?o, ?p)`.
           The initial state shows that:
           - `on(v12, v11)` is true because `supported(v12, v13, v11)` and `atpose(v12, v13)` are true.
           - `on(v8, v11)` is true because `supported(v8, v9, v11)` and `atpose(v8, v9)` are true.
           - `on(v14, v11)` is true because `supported(v14, v15, v11)` and `atpose(v14, v15)` are true.
           
           The goal is to have:
           - `on(v8, v16)`
           - `on(v12, v16)`
           - `on(v14, v16)`
           
           To achieve this goal, the objects need to be moved from `v11` to `v16`. This requires `pick` and `place` actions. However, no instances of `pick` or `place` actions are provided in the list of allowed actions. The only provided action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which does not change the state of the objects or their support relationships in a way that would satisfy the goal. Therefore, the goal is unreachable with the given allowed actions.
