User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene appears to be a square room defined by bounding boxes 0 through 4, with dimensions from -2.5 to 2.5 in both x and y. There's a vertical wall (bounding box 5) at x=0, extending the full height of the room. Several other smaller obstacles are scattered throughout the room, including a large one at (-2.4, -2.34) and others near the walls or in clusters. My strategy will be to generally prefer positions further from known obstacles and closer to the target, as long as they respect the max range. I will try to spread out my choices to increase the chances of finding a valid spot, especially considering there might be hidden non-fixed obstacles. Given the target point, I will calculate candidate positions within a radius of 2 from it, trying to avoid the explicit obstacles.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point for the last request was (2.149, 2.168). The previous attempts show that (0.0, 2.0) collided with the central wall (box 5). (1.414, 1.414) collided with box 15. (2.0, 0.0) had no line of sight, likely due to box 5. This tells me I need to be careful with the central wall and also the smaller obstacles in the room.
