           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v12, v20)
               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Base Configuration Constraint**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to get these five objects, `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18`, all stacked on `v20`.  Seems straightforward: pick them up from where they are (currently on `v11`) and place them on `v20`.  Simple plan, right?
           
           Looking at the setup, I've got two arms, both hands are empty, and I'm at base configuration `v3`. The objects are all graspable and can be stacked on `v20`.  Great.  I've even got the pre-computed kinematics: the grasps, the target poses (represented by `#o2`), and the support relations indicating they *can* be on `v20`.  
           
           The problem arises when examining the "move" operations.  I see `pick` and `place` actions that I can leverage to relocate the objects. They depend on the `kin` facts, which specify the kinematics of these pick/place actions, require the base to be at a configuration called `#o3`.  Here's the rub: I'm currently at `v3` and the *only* available `move_base` action does *nothing* - it moves me from `v3` to `v3`, which is useless!  It can't change the base configuration to `#o3`.
           
           It looks like the pick/place actions have a precondition `atbconf(#o3)`. But I can't satisfy this precondition since the available `move_base` action only gives me `atbconf(v3)`. So, the robot's base configuration is locked, unable to transition to `#o3`. All pick/place actions that I can imagine executing will require `atbconf(#o3)`. Since all `kin` facts require the base config `#o3`,  the robot is effectively unable to change its base configuration to execute any pick/place action.
           
           Therefore, given the available actions and constraints, this goal is unreachable.  I can't move the objects because I can't satisfy the preconditions of the required move actions.  It looks like my only option is to report that this plan isn't feasible given these limitations.
