(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation Strategy**
           
           Okay, so I need to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 6) on a specific surface. This object is square with dimensions 0.0923... x 0.0923..., and the surface is a square centered at (0,0) with bounds of (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           Since the object is square, its orientation (theta) doesn't impact its bounding box.  I'll simplify things by setting `theta = 0` for all placements. This means I just need to find valid (x, y) coordinates for the object's center such that its bounding box fits entirely within the surface.
           
           Let's do some quick math.  Half the object's width is 0.046...  To keep the object inside the surface, the center's x-coordinate must be between -0.135 + 0.046... and 0.135 - 0.046..., which gives me a valid x range of approximately -0.088... to 0.088... The same logic applies to the y-coordinate.
           
           Now, how to get 50 placements?  I'll use a 10x5 grid within that valid x, y range.  I'll space the x and y coordinates evenly across the valid ranges.  This means I'll have 10 x-values and 5 y-values, giving me a total of 50 distinct placements.
           
           So, the strategy:
           1.  Surface index is 0.
           2.  Orientation theta is 0 (can be PI/2, etc., but 0 is easiest).
           3.  Calculate the ranges for x and y, and space the x and y-coordinates out evenly based on a 10 x 5 grid.
           
           That's it, should work great.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Planning: Avoiding Collision**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed object 6, and now I need to figure out where to put object 5, a square-shaped object. Its dimensions are known, and I've got the surface bounds. My challenge? Find 50 stable placements for object 5 on surface 0, making sure it doesn't collide with object 6.
           
           First, I define the AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) for both objects. I know object 6's location, so I calculate its AABB. Then, I define object 5's possible placement range within the surface bounds.
           
           The critical step is collision avoidance. To avoid collision, I need to ensure the AABBs of objects 5 and 6 *do not* overlap. I derive the conditions where their AABBs *do not* overlap, which means either object 5 must be to the right, left, above, or below object 6.  I substitute known values for object 6's position and object 5's size.  After calculating, I find that object 5 *cannot* be to the left or below object 6, given the surface limits.
           
           This narrows down my options. Object 5 is valid to place on the right or above object 6. I've now defined a "forbidden" region within which the object 5's center cannot be.  I then create a grid covering the area where object 5 *can* be placed, avoiding the collision zone.
           
           I calculate a 10x6 grid (with `dx` and `dy`) and filter out the points inside the forbidden region. Since I need exactly 50 placements, after generating this grid, I only take the first 50 which results in the best candidates for object placement. Finally, the list of valid placements are obtained, with all rotations set to zero, since the object is square.

(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements for Object ID 4 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, I'm tasked with finding 50 stable positions for object ID 4, a square with extents of about 0.08855, on Surface 0. This surface has bounds of roughly [-0.135, 0.135] in both X and Y.  My primary constraint is avoiding collisions with two existing objects: ID 6 and ID 5.
           
           First, I need to define the valid range for object 4's center, ignoring collisions for now. The half-extent is about 0.04427. This means the center of Object 4 can move within a range from approximately -0.090722 to +0.090722 in both X and Y.
           
           Now, let's consider the obstacles:
           
           *   **Object ID 6:** Located at (-0.0888, -0.0888), it's a square with extents of 0.092323. Its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) spans roughly [-0.135, -0.04267] in both X and Y.
           
           *   **Object ID 5:** Centered at (-0.0996, -0.0332), its extents are about 0.07075.  My conservative square approximation gives its AABB as roughly [-0.135, -0.06425] in X and [-0.0685, 0.00217] in Y.
           
           To avoid collisions, I need to block out regions where object 4's center cannot be. I'll construct a collision avoidance region for each object.
           
           **Collision Avoidance:**
           
           For Object 6, to avoid overlap, Object 4's center must either be to the right or above Object 6.  This means: x >= 0.001600950867839905 OR y >= 0.001600950867839905.  This creates a forbidden region in the bottom-left corner of the surface bounds.
           
           For Object 5, the condition is x >= -0.019971 OR y >= 0.046445 OR y <= -0.11286.
           
           **Combining the Restrictions:**
           
           I need to combine both forbidden regions. It seems like the combination is the union of 2 regions. Forbidden region #1 is `[-0.090722, 0.0016)` x `[-0.090722, 0.0016)`, which represents the bottom-left of the surface and collision with ID 6. The second region is `[-0.090722, -0.01997)` x `(0.0016, 0.0464)` which comes from collisions with Object ID 5 and extends a little bit from bottom left to a bit towards the top of surface 0.
           
           **Placement Generation and Grid Strategy:**
           
           I'll generate a grid of potential center points for Object 4 across the valid range. I will consider `x_min_allowed`, `x_max_allowed`, `y_min_allowed`, and `y_max_allowed`. I am setting `num_x_steps = 10` and `num_y_steps = 7`, and `dx` = (0.090722 - (-0.090722)) / (10 - 1) = 0.020160450379743194, and `dy` = (0.090722 - (-0.090722)) / (7 - 1) = 0.03024067556961479.  I'll then evaluate each point for collision and accept it if it is safe and fill the placements with up to 50 of them.  The placement strategy will involve two for loops from (0, 0) up to (10, 7).

(Thoughts: **Here's my thought process to find 50 stable placements for Object ID 7 within Surface 0:**
           
           I've got a square object, Object 7, that I need to place safely on Surface 0, avoiding collisions with previously placed objects (IDs 6, 5, and 4). My main goal is to find 50 stable placements. I'll need to work through several constraints: ensuring full containment within the surface and preventing any overlaps with the other objects.
           
           **My Plan:**
           
           1.  **Understand the Geometry:** First, I'm working with a square object, so the geometry is simpler. I'll calculate the half-extents (hw7) for easy collision calculations. I'll also define the surface boundaries and object positions (x,y) to calculate object 7's AABB.
           
           2.  **Containment Check:** I'll determine the valid range for Object 7's center coordinates (x and y) within Surface 0. Object 7's placement can be no closer to the surface bounds than its half extents.
           
           3.  **Collision Avoidance:** I'll analyze each of the other three objects (6, 5, and 4) to determine their AABB, which will establish forbidden regions. I will calculate how the center of object 7 needs to avoid these areas by calculating the offset AABBs.
           
           4.  **Creating the Search Space:** I'll then create a grid within the valid containment region. I'll determine the step size for the grid based on the surface area and the needed number of placements.
           
           5.  **Placement Validation:** For each candidate grid point, I'll check it against the forbidden regions caused by the existing objects. If a point is collision-free, I'll mark it as a valid placement.
           
           6.  **Finding Stable Placements:** By starting with the upper right and working down, I should ensure that I find placements outside the forbidden regions early, therefore reaching 50 valid solutions more quickly.
