User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.238, -0.359, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.281, 0.96).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).

           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.08, 0.402), (0.017, 0.5)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.218, 0.18), (-0.132, 0.266)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.165, -0.265), (0.254, -0.177)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.071, -0.352, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.677, 0.736).

           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.175, 0.223, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.602, 0.798).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.21, -0.221, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.586, 0.81).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v20)
               Atom on(v12, v20)
               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning for Goal Unachievability**
           
           My primary goal is to move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) from their current poses on object v11 to a new pose on object v20. This requires changing the `atpose` facts associated with each of these objects to reflect their new locations.
           
           To accomplish this, I must employ `pick` and `place` actions. The `pick` action would take an object from its current pose, and the `place` action would position it at the desired location on v20. However, the problem statement presents a critical constraint: I can only utilize action *instances* that are explicitly provided in the "list of valid action instances."
           
           In the given scenario, the permitted list includes only one `move_base` action: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  No `pick` or `place` instances are included. The problem's wording is quite clear: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           Since the `pick` and `place` actions are absent from the list of valid instances, I am fundamentally unable to move the objects and thereby cannot achieve the objective of placing them on v20. The current robot base motion available does not support picking or placing objects. Therefore, the goal is unreachable given the stipulated constraints.
