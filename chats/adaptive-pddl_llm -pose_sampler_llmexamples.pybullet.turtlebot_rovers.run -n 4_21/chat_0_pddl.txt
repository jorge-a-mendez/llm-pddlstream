User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point is (0.9150143584852926 -0.9234195195447738).
           I need to find 3 robot base positions (x, y) such that the Euclidean distance between (x, y) and the target point is at most 2. The robot's orientation will be automatically adjusted to face the target.
           The scene has several obstacles:
           - A large central square obstacle (0) from (-2.5, -2.5) to (2.5, 2.5), which is likely the boundaries of the environment, not an obstacle to avoid *within* the environment.
           - Walls (1, 2, 3, 4) form an outer boundary.
           - A vertical wall (5) along x=0.
           - Several smaller box obstacles (6-22).
           
           I will try to place the robot in open areas, avoiding the known obstacles and the central x=0 wall. I will prioritize positions that are relatively close to the target but also offer some variety in angle.
           
           Given the target (0.915, -0.923), it's in the bottom right quadrant. The vertical wall at x=0 means I should generally try to stay on the right side of it if I want to be close to the target.
           
           I will try positions around the target point, varying the angle while maintaining a distance of less than 2.
           
           Let's consider some positions:
           1. Directly to the right of the target. This would be (target_x + r, target_y).
           2. Directly below the target. This would be (target_x, target_y - r).
           3. To the upper right of the target.
           4. To the lower right of the target.
           
           Positions:
           (1.9150143584852926 -0.9234195195447738)
           (0.9150143584852926 -1.9234195195447738)
           (1.5 0.0)
