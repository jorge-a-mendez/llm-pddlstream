           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`. Simple enough: currently, they're sitting on `v11`.  My usual approach?  Pick each one up and place it on `v16`.  Standard.
           
           I've examined the situation and it seems pretty straightforward. Each object has to be supported by `v16` and in the correct pose.  `supported` and `atpose` conditions must be met for `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` on `v16`.  I have all the facts, the kinematic information is available: `atpose`, `graspable`, `supported`, `stackable`, the `kin` facts that are key to finding a valid plan.  `kin` facts are key.
           
           Now, here's the rub. The provided constraints are exceptionally tight. The available action instances are restricted to only `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This base move is ineffective.  It simply moves the base from its current configuration to the same configuration - no change.  And the initial state contains the robot in the atbconf state `(atbconf v3)`.
           
           My usual 'pick' and 'place' actions are not in the approved list.  This creates a problem. In order for `v8`, `v12`, `v14` to be moved, I require these pick and place actions, and the plan would be: `pick`, `place`, `pick`, `place`, `pick`, `place`.
           
           The critical point is this: the rules strictly state that any action instance *not* in the given list is prohibited.  The plan, with 'pick' and 'place', is not allowed.   
           
           Given these tight constraints, no valid plan can achieve the desired goal. The robot is stuck and unable to execute the required moves. It's a dead end - it can't be done given only `move_base`.
