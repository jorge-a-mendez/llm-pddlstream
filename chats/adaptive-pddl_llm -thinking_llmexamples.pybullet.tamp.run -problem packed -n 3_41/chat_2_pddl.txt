           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Path to Reaching the Goal State**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is to get these three objects (v8, v12, and v14) onto v16. Currently, they're all resting on v11. The core idea is simple: pick them up one by one and place them on v16. The initial state and available actions offer the clues we need to succeed.
           
           We've got the necessary capabilities: a robot base that can move and an arm (v4) to handle the objects. The system presents us with kinesthetic data detailing the arm's motion and grasp configurations for these objects, specifically to and from a certain pose #o2.  Additionally, we have grasp configurations which are identical for each object.
           
           The current setup shows the objects are all supported on v11; our goal is supported on v16. Given how the data is structured, the critical piece is to move them all to pose #o2, because the relationships mean they will be supported when at the correct pose.  
           
           Here's the plan: First, the robot base needs to be reconfigured to position itself for the arm's operations. This base movement from configuration v3 to #o3 precedes any "pick" or "place".  
           
           Then, for each object, we'll execute the pick and place actions:
           
           1.  **Move the Base:**  Adjust the robot's base to the operational configuration (#o3) because the kinesthetic information refers to a base configuration other than the initial (v3).  A simple action gets the base in place.
           2.  **Pick:**  Use arm v4 to grasp and lift each object from its current location. Each action uses specific kinesthetic data.
           3.  **Place:** Move arm v4 to position the grasped object onto v16 at the target pose, #o2.
           
           Since there's no clear ordering constraint other than safety, the order doesn't matter too much. This pick-and-place sequence is repeated for all the objects, thus achieving our on(x, v16) goal.
