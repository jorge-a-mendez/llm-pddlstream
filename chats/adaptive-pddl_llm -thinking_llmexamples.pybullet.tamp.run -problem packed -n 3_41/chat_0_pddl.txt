User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom stackable(v14, v16)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom atpose(v14, v15)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom stackable(v14, v10)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom supported(v14, v15, v11)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Inability to Formulate a Plan**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a planning problem: get three objects (v8, v12, and v14) onto v16. Simple enough conceptually – just pick them up from their current positions (which are all on v11) and place them on v16. However, my initial state analysis quickly reveals the crux of the issue.
           
           The starting conditions are clear. I've got my base configuration at v3, both robot arms are empty, and I know the initial poses and support relationships for the objects in question.  Crucially,  v8, v12, and v14 are currently *on* v11.  The goal, of course, is to have them *on* v16.  This strongly suggests the necessary operations are *pick* and *place*.
           
           Now, the available actions are the problem. I'm only permitted to use one specific `move_base` action, which essentially does nothing useful. It does change `canmove()` to false and then the `pick`/`place` actions set it to true. But without any `pick` or `place` instances, I am stuck. `move_base` action itself can't manipulate objects.
           
           Given the constraints, I can't interact with the objects at all. The plan reduces to an exercise in frustration. I would need to *pick* up the objects from v11 and *place* them on v16.  However, the restricted list of action instances is fatal to this strategy. The goal of having the objects *on* v16 is thus unreachable.
