           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.007, -0.348), (0.103, -0.251)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.295, -0.519), (-0.21, -0.434)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.249, -0.105, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.756, 0.655).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.241, 0.319, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.138, 0.99).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.055, -0.3, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.479, 0.878).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.252, -0.477, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.785, 0.62).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.288, -0.144), (-0.209, -0.065)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.197, 0.276), (0.284, 0.362)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes four graspable objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) and a large surface (v11) where these objects are currently supported. There are also two arms, v4 and v6, both of which are handempty. The goal is to place all four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) on object v18. Object v18 is a smaller, stackable surface. All objects are currently on v11 at different poses. The robot starts at base configuration v3 and arm v4 is at configuration v5, arm v6 at v7.
           
           Since all objects are on v11 and the target is v18, the robot needs to pick up each object and place it on v18. This involves a sequence of pick and place actions. The provided action instances only include a `move_base` action, and various `kin` predicates for arm v4. This means only arm v4 can be used, and the robot base will not move.
           
           Let's consider the objects:
           - `v8` is at `v9` on `v11`. It needs to be moved to `v18`.
           - `v12` is at `v13` on `v11`. It needs to be moved to `v18`.
           - `v14` is at `v15` on `v11`. It needs to be moved to `v18`.
           - `v16` is at `v17` on `v11`. It needs to be moved to `v18`.
           
           All `kin` predicates involve arm `v4`, base `v3`, and grasp `#o1`, and trajectory `#o4`. They also include poses for the objects on `v11` (v9, v13, v15, v17) and a generic pose `#o2` on `v18` or `v10`. Since the goal is to place on `v18`, we must use `#o2` with `v18`. There are no other actions available, so we will use the same base configuration and grasp for all pick and place operations, and the same arm trajectory, meaning all pick and place operations use `v4` and `v3` and `#o1` and `#o4`.
           
           The plan will involve picking each object from its initial pose on `v11` and placing it on a designated pose on `v18`. Since there are no other poses defined for `v18` in the initial state other than `#o2`, we must use `#o2` for all objects. However, since the problem states "if the plan requires multiple different objects to be placed simultaneously at the same pose starting with '#', then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* object at that pose (not one that works for all)", we will assume that `#o2` can be instantiated to different physical poses for each object. We need to define four different collision-free poses for `#o2` on `v18` for `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`.
           
           The given AABB for v18 is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           The AABBs of the objects are:
           v14: `((0.007, -0.348), (0.103, -0.251))` (relative to v15)
           v12: `((-0.295, -0.519), (-0.21, -0.434))` (relative to v13)
           v8: `((-0.288, -0.144), (-0.209, -0.065))` (relative to v9)
           v16: `((0.197, 0.276), (0.284, 0.362))` (relative to v17)
           
           Since no values are given for `#o2`, we need to find appropriate collision-free poses on `v18` for each object. The poses will be relative to the center of `v18` which is at (0,0) in its own coordinate system. The actual poses in the world frame will have a Z coordinate such that the object is supported on v18. The base of v18 is assumed to be at Z = 0.781 (since all other objects are at this Z coordinate when on v11).
           
           Let's choose these poses on `v18` (center at (0,0, 0.781) and range from -0.135 to 0.135 in x and y):
           
           For v8 (aabb `((-0.288, -0.144), (-0.209, -0.065))`, which is smaller than v18):
           Let's place v8 at (-0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0)
           For v12 (aabb `((-0.295, -0.519), (-0.21, -0.434))`, smaller than v18):
           Let's place v12 at (0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0)
           For v14 (aabb `((0.007, -0.348), (0.103, -0.251))`, smaller than v18):
           Let's place v14 at (-0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0)
           For v16 (aabb `((0.197, 0.276), (0.284, 0.362))`, smaller than v18):
           Let's place v16 at (0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0)
           
           All these x,y values are within the bounds of v18.
           
           The plan will be:
           1. Pick v8 from v9
           2. Place v8 on #o2 (instantiated for v8)
           3. Pick v12 from v13
           4. Place v12 on #o2 (instantiated for v12)
           5. Pick v14 from v15
           6. Place v14 on #o2 (instantiated for v14)
           7. Pick v16 from v17
           8. Place v16 on #o2 (instantiated for v16)

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The problem states that only `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))` is a valid action instance. This action moves the robot's base from `v3` to `v3` using trajectory `#o0`. This action doesn't change the state of any objects or achieve the goal of placing objects on `v18`. All other actions (pick, place, clean, cook) are not provided as valid instances, meaning they cannot be used. Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the given set of valid action instances.
