User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.007, -0.348), (0.103, -0.251)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.295, -0.519), (-0.21, -0.434)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.249, -0.105, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.756, 0.655).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.241, 0.319, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.138, 0.99).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.055, -0.3, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.479, 0.878).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.252, -0.477, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.785, 0.62).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.288, -0.144), (-0.209, -0.065)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.197, 0.276), (0.284, 0.362)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes four graspable objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) and one surface (v11) on which they are currently supported. The goal is to place all four objects on surface v18. The robot currently has two arms, v4 and v6, both of which are empty. The robot is at base configuration v3 and arm configurations v5 and v7 respectively.
           
           The only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which moves the robot base from v3 to v3 with trajectory #o0. This action, however, does not directly contribute to the goal of placing objects on v18.
           
           All pick and place actions require kinematic information (kin), and the available action instance list does not contain any pick or place actions. Without pick and place actions, the robot cannot move the objects from their current locations on v11 to the target surface v18.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable given the current set of available action instances.
