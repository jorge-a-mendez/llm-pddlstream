User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.031, 0.195), (0.12, 0.284)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.053, 0.36), (0.026, 0.439)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.276, 0.313), (-0.181, 0.407)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.264, -0.184), (-0.184, -0.103)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.171, 0.378), (0.259, 0.466)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.075, 0.24, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.817, 0.577).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.014, 0.4, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.656, 0.755).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.228, 0.36, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.855, 0.519).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.224, -0.143, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.761, 0.649).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.215, 0.422, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.595, 0.804).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v12, v20)

               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Problem Analysis: Unreachable Goal**
           
           Initially, I'm faced with moving five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) from their initial positions on surface v11 to surface v20. The obvious plan is to pick each object from its current pose and place it on v20. However, the problem is that I'm restricted to using a single action instance: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. The `on` axiom that I need to satisfy `on(?o: object, ?r: object)` is true if `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)` are true. The `supported` fact exists in the initial state, so the problem is to make `atpose(?o, #o2)` true for each object.
           
           This is where things get tricky. The constraint, "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan," directly contradicts the objective of picking and placing objects. Only `move_base` is available. Without `pick` and `place` instances, the goal is unreachable.
           
           I could *try* to create the plan as if `pick` and `place` are available, defining continuous parameters like `#o2` for target poses on `v20` and trajectory parameters for picking and placing (kin and traj). However, the initial base configuration `v3 = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0)` creates a reachability issue. The robot base is positioned too far from the objects on surface v11 and within the bounded surface of v20. A PR2 arm's maximum reach is typically about 0.9 meters. The base being 1 meter away from initial object poses makes the pick impossible. Therefore, even if the robot could pick and place, it's kinematically impossible. The `kin` fact, required for the `pick` action to be feasible, is not possible to generate.
           
           Given this, the goal of getting each object `on v20` is *unreachable*. I can't achieve this because: (1) I'm restricted to only using the move_base action, and (2) even if I *could* use `pick` and `place`, the objects are beyond the robot's reach from the fixed base configuration.
