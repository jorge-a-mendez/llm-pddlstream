User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.031, 0.195), (0.12, 0.284)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.053, 0.36), (0.026, 0.439)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.276, 0.313), (-0.181, 0.407)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.264, -0.184), (-0.184, -0.103)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.171, 0.378), (0.259, 0.466)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.075, 0.24, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.817, 0.577).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.014, 0.4, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.656, 0.755).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.228, 0.36, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.855, 0.519).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.224, -0.143, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.761, 0.649).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.215, 0.422, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.595, 0.804).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Plan to Stack Objects on v20**
           
           Alright, here's the game plan: I need to get five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) onto v20. The catch? My base is stuck where it is (v3), so I'm playing the "arm-only" game. This means picking up each object from its initial perch (v9, v13, v15, v17, v19, respectively) and placing it down on v20.  I've got a set of continuous poses (#o2) for each object that guarantees a collision-free placement. These are unique coordinates on v20 that avoid overlaps:
           
           *   v8: (-0.05, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   v12: (0.05, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   v14: (-0.05, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   v16: (0.05, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   v18: (0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           
           I'm using arm v4, grasp #o1, base configuration v3, and the pre-computed trajectory #o4 for each pick and place. The sequence will be:
           
           1.  Pick v8, place v8
           2.  Pick v12, place v12
           3.  Pick v14, place v14
           4.  Pick v16, place v16
           5.  Pick v18, place v18

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v18 v19 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v18 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impasse of the Plan**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a plan and, as expected, it's riddled with issues. The user highlights the core problem: all the suggested `pick` and `place` actions are invalid. The *only* action that's actually valid is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  That's... less than helpful.
           
           The goal is pretty straightforward: get five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) onto a specific object, v20.  Looking at the initial state, those objects are currently chilling on v11. The plan needs to manipulate the objects to get them to the desired final location.
           
           Now, I understand the underlying logic. The `on` predicate translates to both `supported` and `atpose`, so for the goal to be satisfied, the `atpose` predicates for these objects must shift from their current poses on v11 to new poses on v20.  Essentially, the objects need to be *moved*.
           
           Here's the rub: the only available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  It's a no-op! It just moves the robot's base to the same location, which is completely irrelevant to the actual task of moving objects. It's like asking someone to build a bridge, and they only hand you a hammer, but no nails or wood.
           
           Given the goal and the available actions, it's immediately obvious that this plan is completely unachievable. There's simply no mechanism to actually *move* the objects from their current location to the desired location. We're stuck!
