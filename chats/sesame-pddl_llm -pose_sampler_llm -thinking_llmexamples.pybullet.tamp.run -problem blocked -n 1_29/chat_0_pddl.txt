           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Here's my thought process:**  I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0, given the object's size and surface dimensions. The object is nearly square (0.07 x 0.07), and the surface is a rectangle defined by ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  My task is to output a list of tuples, each representing a placement as (surf_idx, theta, x, y).  `surf_idx` will always be 0.  `theta` will be 0 or pi/2 for diversity in orientation.  `x` and `y` must fall within the surface bounds, considering the object's dimensions and the chosen orientation.
           
           To determine safe placement ranges, I calculated bounding box dimensions for both orientations (0 and pi/2). Because the object's extents are almost equal, the placement ranges were also almost identical. To be conservative, I chose the more restrictive bounds. After doing the precise math, I got these bounds for x: [4.2350000000000005, 4.764999999999999] and for y: [-0.5649999999999999, -0.03500000000000014].
           
           To ensure I have 50 placements, I'll create a grid. The surface dimensions are 0.6x0.6, so I can fit roughly 8 in each direction. I decided on an 8x7 grid to accommodate 50+ placements. This provides room to space out the placements.  I'll space them out equally along the ranges, using a step size of roughly 0.0757 in the x and 0.0883 in the y direction. To get 50, I'll iterate through the grid, creating the (surf_idx, theta, x, y) tuples. I'll alternate the `theta` value of 0 and pi/2.
           
           To be precise, I recalculated the AABB for a rotated object at pi/4, and the constraints of the range were too tight to be useful. I'll stick to the simpler approach. I'm taking the conservative approach when choosing the min/max coordinates to ensure that they are valid for both angles. Since the bounding boxes are almost identical, I won't have gaps. The dimensions were precisely calculated in the decimal precision, and that will be honored for the final output. The main goal is to generate 50 distinct and stable placements on surface 0.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 10 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's my plan for placing this new object (ID 10). I've got to avoid collisions with the existing, placed object (ID 5).  I'll use their successful placements to create an obstacle zone. 
           
           Since object 5's placements were all along a straight line, I calculated their bounding boxes. This revealed two main regions occupied by object 5: one centered around y=-0.565, and another near y=-0.477. Object 5 dimensions are small,  so I'll treat them as a continuous line on a very narrow region for each placement.  I'll then identify the *safe* zone for object 10 by removing these occupied areas from the usable surface area.
           
           Object 10 is almost square, so I'll create a grid-like placement strategy to make sure I get a good, evenly spaced set. For placements, I will use `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/2` for simplicity and diversity (which gives two similar AABBs).
           
           First, I define safe zones, excluding object 5 locations, which I'll call Region A and Region B. 
           Region A has x from 4.39459 to 4.75112, and y from -0.4811 to -0.3927.
           Region B has x from 4.2488 to 4.7511, and y from -0.3927 to -0.0488.
           
           I will then use a fine grid with a spacing of roughly half of object 10's side length, in both x and y. I plan to use alternating rotations (`theta = 0` and `pi/2`) to diversify object placements. I'll make a list of 104 potential placements and pick the first 50. I need to make sure I respect the surface limits.
