(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5, dimensions 0.07 x 0.07) on a rectangular surface (Surface 0, from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0)).  A placement means defining the surface, the object's orientation (`theta`), and the center coordinates (x, y) of the object's bounding box.  Crucially, the object must *fully* fit within the surface.
           
           My initial thought is that the square object means the bounding box calculations for collision will be easier. Rotating it changes the world-aligned bounding box. The dimensions will increase slightly if I choose any angle other than the axis aligned angles like zero and pi/2.
           
           Since the surface area is relatively large compared to the object, I'll spread out placement.  I'll want to cover as much area as possible. Given that the object is a square, the "effective" bounding box changes with rotation. I calculate a single value because the `size_x` and `size_y` dimensions are the same, in this case it would be `0.07 * ( abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)) )`. The half-extents will always be identical.
           
           To find the correct placement coordinates, I first calculate the ranges. When the object is not rotated, (`theta = 0`), its center can range from 4.235 to 4.765 along the x-axis and from -0.565 to -0.035 along the y-axis, since the surface is from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0) and the object is (0.07,0.07). These ranges are relatively wide: 0.53 units in each direction.
           
           I can make a good distribution with a grid of x, y coordinates and then varied rotations. I decided to make a grid of positions with two orientations, `theta=0` and `theta = pi/2`. Because object is a square object and those are the best orientations to place and ensure maximum coverage. With the axis-aligned bounding box, the best ranges is `0.035`. By using both positions, I cover the surface in an organized and evenly spread out manner, which would satisfy the requirements of "stable." I then generate `x` values in 0.1 increments and `y` values in increments of 0.1 for 0.07 bounding boxes.
           
           With the x and y values for theta=0, I create a total of 50 different locations, 25 for theta=0 and 25 for theta = pi/2. These locations are shifted slightly to reduce overlap, but use nearly the full surface with each orientation. The end result is a diverse set of coordinates that ensures that each object fits fully within the space, which fulfills the primary requirement of "stable".

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object ID 10: Avoiding Collisions with Object ID 5**
           
           Okay, so I've got the successful placement data for Object ID 5, noted. Now, I need to figure out where to place Object ID 10 on the same surface, while making sure it doesn't bump into any of those ID 5 objects.
           
           Object ID 10 is basically a square with sides of about 0.0972 units. The surface I'm working with is defined by the coordinates (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0).  First things first, I calculate the effective dimensions considering Object ID 10 can rotate, but a square's smallest bounding box (AABB) will always be the same size. So, the "half extent" of my square (half of a side length) is approximately 0.0486.
           
           Based on the surface's dimensions, the allowed area for Object ID 10's center is x-values from roughly 4.2486 to 4.7514, and y-values from -0.5514 to -0.0486.
           
           Crucially, I need to account for the previously placed Object ID 5, and the rule that I must avoid collisions with existing object placements. I've got the locations of 10 successful placements for Object ID 5, and I've analyzed that each object is an AABB with an extent of approximately 0.035.
           
           I'm thinking of placing ID 10 with `theta = 0` (or `pi/2` since the AABB is the same), meaning the AABB would be centered on the center points for placement, ranging from `[center_x - 0.0486, center_y - 0.0486]` to `[center_x + 0.0486, center_y + 0.0486]`. I need to be careful! If the AABB of the new object overlaps with any of the previous object's ABB then the placement must be considered invalid.
           
           So, I devised a collision check using AABBs to prevent placing the new object on top of any of the old ones. I have to iterate through *potential* locations and check each placement against the 10 ID 5 placements I've already confirmed work.
           Let's iterate coordinates to check for suitable places. The AABB for the surface is already mentioned, surface 0.
           
           Based on testing, and trying to space the placements, a good starting point is probably starting `x = 4.4186` instead of `4.2486` to avoid any overlap.
           The valid x locations that do *not* collide are roughly `[4.4186, 4.7514]`. I can try to generate a grid of 6 rows and 11 columns in the available space.
           My goal is to find at least 50 valid, non-colliding locations for Object ID 10.
           As long as the x-coordinate does not overlap, then collision is avoided.
           Since Object ID 10 is a square, it doesn't matter what the angle (`theta`) is.
           
           By calculating `aabb_10`'s coordinates for each center coordinate and checking it, I avoid collision as long as `x_center` of `aabb_10` `> 4.37 + h_10`, with `h_10 = 0.04860249840305045`, meaning the `x_center` for the new AABB should be no less than 4.4186.
           
           To get to 50 locations, I can place Object 10 44 times where the center coordinate starts from `(4.4486, -0.5514)` through steps of 0.05. I can then use different angles to generate some extra distinct points.
           
           I have confirmed through calculations that this approach works.  Thus, I can confidently place 50 distinct positions without collisions. The first 44 will use `theta = 0`.  The last 6 can use `theta = pi/2`.  This is a good strategy to keep placements within bounds without any collision issues.
