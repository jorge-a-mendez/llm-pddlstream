(Thoughts: **Planning to Satisfy `new-axiom@0()` in the `pr2-tamp` Domain**
           
           My goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which means placing an object of a certain type on a specific surface. After examining the axioms, I've identified the subgoals: `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.  I'm focusing on object `v12`, which is `type(v12, v17)` in the initial state, fulfilling the type requirement.  My reasoning now focuses on `on(v12, v18)`.  
           
           Since `on` is derived from `supported` and `atpose`, I need to position `v12` such that it's `atpose` where it will also be `supported` by `v18`.  `v12` is initially at pose `v13` and supported by `v14`. I see that `v12` is also `stackable` on `v18`. There's an available pose `#p1` where `v12` is *supported* by `v18`. Therefore, my plan is to move `v12` to `#p1`.
           
           To execute this plan, I'll utilize the robot's arm, `v4`, which is `handempty`. My plan involves picking up `v12` from its current location, and placing it at the new pose, `#p1`, which is on the surface, `v18`. I will also use base motion to get into position.  
           
           The plan involves four steps. First, move the robot base from initial configuration `v3` to configuration `#q2` to enable picking `v12`. Then, pick up `v12` with the available hand (`v4`). Next, move the base again from `#q2` to `#q3` (for the placement configuration). Finally, place `v12` at pose `#p1` on `v18`.
           
           I've examined the action preconditions and the state changes, including the necessary base movements, pick and place actions, and the appropriate grasp. The intermediate states after each action are also considered. All preconditions for each action are met by the initial state and previous actions in the sequence. Moreover, the goal condition is satisfied by placing `v12` with appropriate base configurations and arm trajectories. The `unsafe` predicates are all true (given the problem statement).  Therefore, I believe this plan is valid and sound. The plan sequence also adheres to the order of operations as per the action instances supplied.
