           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching the Unreachable: A Dead End**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: `new-axiom@0()`. Breaking it down, I need to achieve the following: certain `atconf` and `free` predicates are already true in the initial state, so I'm good there. However, I'm missing three `receivedimage` predicates and two `receivedanalysis` predicates (for a rock of type v2 and soil of type v6).
           
           Looking at the available actions, I'm facing a serious constraint: I can *only* use `move` (which are self-loops, meaning they do nothing) and `drop_rock`. No other actions are allowed.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`, I'd need to use `take_image` and `send_image`, but those aren't permitted. Similarly, to get `receivedanalysis`, I'd need `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`, which are also off-limits. The `drop_rock` actions won't help because the free conditions are already present. The `move` actions are self loops and don't do anything.
           
           Essentially, I'm given a set of building blocks that are utterly incapable of constructing the desired structure. The actions to obtain the necessary `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates are simply *not* available. The provided "valid" action instances are completely irrelevant to the problem.
           
           Thus, based on the initial state and the permitted actions, this goal is *unreachable*. There is no plan I can construct to satisfy the given axiom.
