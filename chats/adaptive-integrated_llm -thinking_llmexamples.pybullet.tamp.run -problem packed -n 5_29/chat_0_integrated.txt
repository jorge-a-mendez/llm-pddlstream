User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.206, 0.245), (-0.109, 0.342)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.182, -0.34), (-0.085, -0.243)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.24, 0.474), (-0.157, 0.557)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.1, -0.517), (-0.026, -0.443)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.158, 0.294, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.88, 0.475).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.115, -0.361), (0.212, -0.264)).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.133, -0.292, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.881, 0.473).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.199, 0.516, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.995, 0.105).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.063, -0.48, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, -0.027).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.163, -0.312, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.881, -0.473).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Assessing the Plan's Feasibility**
           
           Okay, I'm faced with a classic planning problem. The goal is straightforward: get five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) onto surface v20. Currently, all these objects are resting on surface v11. The core of the problem is that I'm only allowed to use the `move_base` action: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.
           
           First, I checked the initial state.  The `on` predicates are derived from `supported` and `atpose`.  It's clear that all five objects are initially `on(v11)`.
           
           The crucial constraint is the very limited action set. The only available action is the robot moving its base from v3 to v3 with trajectory #o0.  This doesn't move or manipulate any objects. It changes the robot's base configuration from the current to itself and resets the canmove() flag. It will cost nothing as there is no distance to traverse.
           
           I've got `pick` and `place` actions at my disposal, but I can't use them. To utilize them, I'd need the relevant `kin` facts and have these actions in the action list. The required initial facts are present. I have `atbconf` and `ataconf` facts, and I also have `grasp` and `pose` facts. These are all facts which are present to make both actions valid.
           
           The key observation is the absence of `pick` or `place` in the allowed actions. The problem description explicitly states: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           Since I'm only allowed to move the robot's base, which doesn't affect the objects' positions, it is impossible to achieve the goal state. No matter how many times the robot moves, it will not change the `on` predicates of the objects. Since the robot cannot manipulate any of the objects by picking them up and placing them down, the goal of getting each object onto surface v20 is *unachievable* given the constraints.
