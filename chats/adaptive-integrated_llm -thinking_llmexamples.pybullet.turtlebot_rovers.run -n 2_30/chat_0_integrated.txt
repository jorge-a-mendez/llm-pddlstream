           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v7 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.026, 0.992), (-0.885, 1.133)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571)).
           Object v4 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.514, 0.893), (1.62, 0.999)).
           Object v1 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.881, -1.615), (1.987, -1.51)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.821, -1.929), (1.187, -1.571)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.208, 0.034), (1.346, 0.172)).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.499, 1.971), (0.594, 2.066)).
           Object v5 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.283, 0.449), (-1.145, 0.587)).
           Object v9 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
           Object v15 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           Object v3 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.446, 0.245), (0.538, 0.338)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.839, 2.145), (1.918, 2.225)).
           Object v13 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unachievable Due to Geometric Constraints**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which I've dissected. It boils down to needing two rovers, *v12* and *v14*, to achieve several conditions: *receivedimage* from objectives *v17* and *v18*, and *receivedanalysis* of two rocks (one of type *v2*, the other of type *v6*). No problem, I can handle this. I know the available actions, the initial state facts, and the preconditions for each action. It seems straightforward: take some pictures, send them, analyze some rocks, and transmit the analysis.
           
           But hold on... I'm noticing something crucial here: The only available *move* actions are self-moves. *v12* can only "move" from its initial configuration *v13* *to* *v13*, and *v14* can only "move" from *v15* *to* *v15*. This is a huge constraint! This means they are effectively *fixed* in place.
           
           Now, the *imagevisible* and *comvisible* predicates, which are preconditions for image-related actions, depend on a *continuous* parameter `#o3`.  The instructions are clear: if I *use* `#o3`, I have to provide a specific value for it. Further, the values for *#o3* must make the condition valid, meaning that `#o3` must be within 2 meters for `imagevisible`.  Also, The prompt also says "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state ... then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration such that, given the geometry of the scene, the configuration is collision-free for the rover, *reachable from the rover's current configuration*". However, The *only* "reachable" configuration from *v13* is *v13* itself, and the only "reachable" configuration from *v15* is *v15*.
           
           Here's the problem: The camera *can't* see the target objects *v17* or *v18* from *v13* and *v15* if the distance restriction of the *imagevisible* predicate is in place. Simple geometry confirms this. The closest objective, *v17*, is about 3.8 units away from *v12*, and 4 units from *v14*. The distance restriction stated in the documentation is 2 units. The distance restriction makes it impossible for the `imagevisible` precondition to be satisfied and therefore impossible for the `take_image` and `calibrate` actions to be executed.
           
           Given the distance checks, it's impossible to satisfy `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, and therefore impossible to achieve the *receivedimage* preconditions. In short, the rovers *cannot* meet the goal because they can't move to a location to satisfy the *imagevisible* predicate.
