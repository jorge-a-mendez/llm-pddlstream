           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Planning:**
           
           Okay, I'm tasked with achieving the goal `new-axiom@0()`.  Let's break this down. The core requirements are to get two images sent, from objects `v17` and `v18`, and to analyze two rocks, one of type `v2` and another of type `v6`.  I've identified that `v1` and `v5` will serve as those rocks, respectively.  Furthermore, I need to make sure the rovers, `v12` and `v14`, end up back in their initial configurations, `v13` and `v15`, respectively, after the operations. I am assuming the initial conditions are met at the end of the action sequence, therefore I will not need to add the same initial state assumptions.
           
           **Strategic Considerations:**
           
           The initial state provides some key advantages: both rovers have defined motion capabilities, `v12` and `v14` are already at their initial configs. Importantly, the `comvisible` and `imagevisible` facts are given, indicating communication and imaging paths exist. We're given that `v12` has both `imagevisible` and `comvisible` to complete these tasks.
           
           **Action Sequence Design:**
           
           The plan hinges on the following steps:
           
           1.  **Imaging with Rover v12**: I need to get `v12` to a location where it can image, calibrate, take images of `v17` and `v18`, and then send them. It is very likely that `v12` will image both objectives, but I will need to consider whether it's more optimal if each rover image one of the two goals.
           2.  **Sampling and Analysis**: Once the images are sent, `v12` and `v14` must sample and analyze the designated rocks.
           3.  **Return to Starting Positions:** After analysis, I will return `v12` and `v14` to their initial states and unload the analyzed rocks from the store. I must ensure the store is set back to free after dropping the rocks, and both vehicles have the configuration at the start, at the end.
           
           **Detailed Plan (First Draft):**
           
           Given the preconditions, I have identified a valid plan as the following action sequence.
           
           `move(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)`
           `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)`
           `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`
           `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v18, v10)`
           `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`
           `move(v12, #o3, #o2, #o0)`
           `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`
           `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`
           `move(v12, #o0, #o2, #o5)`
           `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v1, v16)`
           `move(v12, #o5, #o2, #o0)`
           `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v1)`
           `move(v14, v15, #o2, #o5)`
           `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v5, v16)`
           `move(v14, #o5, #o2, #o0)`
           `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v5)`
           `drop_rock(v12, v16)`
           `move(v12, #o0, #o2, v13)`
           `drop_rock(v14, v16)`
           `move(v14, #o0, #o2, v15)`
           
           **Continuous Parameter Determination (if applicable):**
           
           I was able to identify the following relevant coordinates:
           - #o3 is set to the coordinate (1.2, 0.5)
           - #o0 is set to the coordinate (-0.5, -1.0)
           
           **Validation:**
           
           The plan appears complete.  The continuous variables I have added are appropriate.  I

It is very likely that `v12` will image both objectives, but I will need to consider whether it's more optimal if each rover image one of the two goals.
           2.  **Sampling and Analysis**: Once the images are sent, `v12` and `v14` must sample and analyze the designated rocks.
           3.  **Return to Starting Positions:** After analysis, I will return `v12` and `v14` to their initial states and unload the analyzed rocks from the store. I must ensure the store is set back to free after dropping the rocks, and both vehicles have the configuration at the start, at the end.
           
           **Detailed Plan (First Draft):**
           
           Given the preconditions, I have identified a valid plan as the following action sequence.
           
           `move(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)`
           `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)`
           `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`
           `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v18, v10)`
           `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`
           `move(v12, #o3, #o2, #o0)`
           `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`
           `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`
           `move(v12, #o0, #o2, #o5)`
           `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v1, v16)`
           `move(v12, #o5, #o2, #o0)`
           `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v1)`
           `move(v14, v15, #o2, #o5)`
           `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v5, v16)`
           `move(v14, #o5, #o2, #o0)`
           `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v5)`
           `drop_rock(v12, v16)`
           `move(v12, #o0, #o2, v13)`
           `drop_rock(v14, v16)`
           `move(v14, #o0, #o2, v15)`
           
           **Continuous Parameter Determination (if applicable):**
           
           I was able to identify the following relevant coordinates:
           - #o3 is set to the coordinate (1.2, 0.5)
           - #o0 is set to the coordinate (-0.5, -1.0)
           
           **Validation:**
           
           The plan appears complete.  The continuous variables I have added are appropriate.  I

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Updated Plan for Rover Operations**
           
           Okay, so the previous plan failed because the communication configuration, `#o0 = (-0.5, -1.0)`, was colliding with obstacle `v19`.  I need to find a new collision-free position for `#o0`.  This position needs to act as the communication hub for the lander, `v9`, while still being accessible by both rovers, `v12` and `v14`.  The lander is located at approximately `(-1.9, -2.0)`, and the communication range is 4.0 units.  My initial thought, `(-0.5, -1.0)`, was within the AABB of `v19`, which is clearly a problem.
           
           I've got a fresh idea: let's try `(-0.1, -1.0)`.  This puts me out of the range of `v19`'s AABB. The distance to the lander is only about `2.05` units, which is well within the acceptable communication distance. So, `(-0.1, -1.0)` is a strong candidate for my new `#o0`.  It appears to be collision-free.
           
           The other configuration, `#o3 = (1.2, 0.5)`, which is the imaging configuration for `v12`, seems perfectly fine. No collisions were reported there, and it's essential for getting images of the objectives, `v17` and `v18`.
           
           So, the overarching plan structure remains the same.  Rover `v12` will first move to `#o3` for imaging, then calibrate and take the pictures, then communicate at `#o0`, and later do some sampling, before returning to its starting position. Rover `v14` will sample at `#o5` and communicate at `#o0` as well. Both will report back to `v9` via `#o0`.
           
           The plan flow is as follows:
           1.  Rover `v12` moves to `#o3`.
           2.  `v12` calibrates.
           3.  `v12` images `v17` and `v18`.
           4.  `v12` goes to `#o0` and sends the images of `v17` and `v18`.
           5.  `v12` moves to `#o5` and samples rock `v1` (type `v2`).
           6.  `v12` goes back to `#o0` and sends the results.
           7.  `v12` drops the rock.
           8.  Rover `v14` moves to `#o5` and samples rock `v5` (type `v6`).
           9.  `v14` goes to `#o0` and sends the results.
           10. `v14` drops the rock.
           11. Both rovers return to their starting configurations.
           
           I've also verified that the initial conditions are met, and the final actions will satisfy the final state conditions. I have made sure to get one of each required rock type and objective. I will assume the lines of sight are good, given that no specific issues were indicated other than the collisions with the configurations themselves.  I've added calibrate to get both images.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Rethinking Configuration Parameters**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. I've been given some errors regarding unreachable and colliding configurations for rovers `v12` and `v14`. Specifically, the existing configurations `#o3` and `#o0` aren't working. My goal is to find new, valid configurations that are:
           
           *   Reachable by the rovers.
           *   Collision-free with the obstacles `v19` and `v20`.
           *   Provide a clear line of sight to the targets.
           *   Satisfy distance constraints (2 for imaging, 4 for communication).
           
           First, let's re-evaluate the object AABBs and initial rover positions. I have the lander `v9` at approximately `(-1.9, -2.0)`, targets `v17` and `v18` roughly at `(0.5465, 2.0185)` and `(1.8785, 2.185)` respectively, obstacle `v19` centered around `x = -0.5`, and the thin wall obstacle `v20` at `x=0`. Rover `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`, and `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           **Finding a New `#o3` (Imaging Configuration for `v12`)**
           
           Rover `v12` needs to image `v17` and `v18`. The previous `#o3` at `(1.2, 0.5)` wasn't reachable. I'll search for a new point that's:
           
           1.  Closer to the targets.
           2.  Within the maximum imaging distance of 2.
           3.  Reachable from `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           I'm thinking, since the targets are in the upper-right quadrant, let's try `(1.0, 1.0)`.
           
           *   Distance to `v17`: approximately `1.11` (within the limit).
           *   Distance to `v18`: approximately `1.47` (also within the limit).
           *   Reachability: The line from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(1.0, 1.0)` is a straight vertical line at `x = 1.0`. No obvious obstacles. Checks collision with `v19` and `v20`. Collision-free since it is at `x = 1.0` (away from both obstacles).
           
           So, `(1.0, 1.0)` seems like a good candidate for `#o3`.
           
           **Finding a New `#o0` (Communication Configuration)**
           
           The previous `#o0` at `(-0.1, -1.0)` was colliding with the wall `v20`. This means I need a point that is *not* at x=0. The lander `v9` is at `(-1.9, -2.0)`, with a max communication distance of 4.
           
           I need a point that is `x < -0.05` or `x > 0.05`. Let's try `(0.5, -1.0)`:
           
           *   Distance to `v9`:  `2.6` (well within the communication distance of 4).
           *   Collision-free: `x=0.5` which is away from the thin wall `v20` and the obstacle `v19`.
           *   Reachable: The point is reachable from both rovers, likely.
           
           So, for `#o0`, I'll use `(0.5, -1.0)`.
           
           **Revised Plan**
           
           The basic plan logic is the same. It is now modified with the calculated values.
           1.  `v12` moves to `(1.0, 1.0)`.
           2.  `v12` images `v17` and `v18`.
           3.  `v12` moves to `(0.5, -1.0)`.
           4.  `v12` sends image `v17` and `v18`.
           5.  `v12` moves to `#o5`.
           6.  `v12` samples rock `v1`.
           7.  `v12` moves to `(0.5, -1.0)`.
           8.  `v12` sends analysis `v1`.
           9.  `v12` drops

           *   Provide a clear line of sight to the targets.
           *   Satisfy distance constraints (2 for imaging, 4 for communication).
           
           First, let's re-evaluate the object AABBs and initial rover positions. I have the lander `v9` at approximately `(-1.9, -2.0)`, targets `v17` and `v18` roughly at `(0.5465, 2.0185)` and `(1.8785, 2.185)` respectively, obstacle `v19` centered around `x = -0.5`, and the thin wall obstacle `v20` at `x=0`. Rover `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`, and `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           **Finding a New `#o3` (Imaging Configuration for `v12`)**
           
           Rover `v12` needs to image `v17` and `v18`. The previous `#o3` at `(1.2, 0.5)` wasn't reachable. I'll search for a new point that's:
           
           1.  Closer to the targets.
           2.  Within the maximum imaging distance of 2.
           3.  Reachable from `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           I'm thinking, since the targets are in the upper-right quadrant, let's try `(1.0, 1.0)`.
           
           *   Distance to `v17`: approximately `1.11` (within the limit).

           So, `(1.0, 1.0)` seems like a good candidate for `#o3`.
           
           **Finding a New `#o0` (Communication Configuration)**
           
           The previous `#o0` at `(-0.1, -1.0)` was colliding with the wall `v20`. This means I need a point that is *not* at x=0. The lander `v9` is at `(-1.9, -2.0)`, with a max communication distance of 4.
           
           I need a point that is `x < -0.05` or `x > 0.05`. Let's try `(0.5, -1.0)`:
           
           *   Distance to `v9`:  `2.6` (well within the communication distance of 4).
           *   Collision-free: `x=0.5` which is away from the thin wall `v20` and the obstacle `v19`.
           *   Reachable: The point is reachable from both rovers, likely.
           
           So, for `#o0`, I'll use `(0.5, -1.0)`.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with devising a plan for these rovers to achieve a new axiom. The primary challenges are ensuring collision-free and occlusion-free paths to specific locations, considering reachability constraints (new!). Essentially, I need to plan where the rovers will move, and what activities they will perform at each location, all while ensuring no collisions and good line-of-sight for their sensors and communicators.  The goal involves imaging and communicating data, and also collecting samples.  The initial configuration is established, and I need to come up with a step-by-step procedure to satisfy the stated goal.
           
           **Re-evaluating Previous Failures and Obstacles**
           
           I've got a history here – prior attempts at this planning problem had issues with collision-free configurations, specifically with two configurations, `#o0` (communications) and `#o3` (imaging). Previous configurations were in collision with obstacles, or were simply unreachable. I've re-reviewed the problem description and key elements. I have a detailed list of objects and their locations, which is helpful. There are two critical obstacles: `v19` (an AABB) and `v20` (a vertical wall at x=0).  The initial starting configurations of the rovers have not changed. The objective is to image and communicate data from two targets (v17 and v18).  Furthermore, rocks (v1 and v5) have to be analysed from the rovers (v12 and v14).
           
           **Obstacle Avoidance and Reachability Considerations**
           
           Now, before, the previous configurations used were not reachable. My primary goal here is to establish a collision-free and occlusion-free path. The previous failures serve as a warning sign. To make my life easier, I need to pick points that are nearby to the starting positions, or that are not blocked off by obstacles.
           The problem emphasizes reachability – the robots cannot "jump" – I need to ensure they can *actually* reach these configurations.
           
           **Configuration Revisions**
           
           *   **#o3 (Imaging Config):** For `#o3` (imaging).  My thought is that `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`, and needs to see both objectives. Given the target locations, `(0.8, 1.0)` seems to be the best location to make the picture of the two targets.
           *   **#o0 (Communication Config):**  For `#o0` (communication), `(-1.0, -1.0)` seems like a good middle-ground location that allows communication with the lander. The idea is to make the communication area accessible to both rovers.
           *   **#o5 (Sampling Config):**  For `#o5` (sampling). Initially I thought I'd have to find a single pose for sampling of different rocks. I re-read the documentation and the "above" predicate, thankfully, I don't need to specify the value for `#o5` given the wording. This seems a bit unusual, but I have to go with it.
           
           **Revised Strategy**
           
           1.  **Imaging (v12):** Rover `v12` moves to `#o3` (`(0.8, 1.0)`) and images objectives.
           2.  **Communication (v12):** Then `v12` moves to `#o0` (`(-1.0, -1.0)`) and sends images.
           3.  **Sampling/Analysis (v12):** Rover `v12` moves to `#o5`, samples rock `v1`, then to `#o0` and sends analysis, drops the samples.
           4.  **Sampling/Analysis (v14):** Rover `v14` moves to `#o5`, samples rock `v5`, then to `#o0` and sends analysis, drops the samples.
           5.  **Return to Initial:** Both rovers return to their initial configurations.
           
           The continuous parameters are well-defined:
               -   `#o3 = (0.8, 1.0)`
               -   `#o0 = (-1.0, -1.0)`

Model:     **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with devising a plan for these rovers to achieve a new axiom. The primary challenges are ensuring collision-free and occlusion-free paths to specific locations, considering reachability constraints (new!). Essentially, I need to plan where the rovers will move, and what activities they will perform at each location, all while ensuring no collisions and good line-of-sight for their sensors and communicators.  The goal involves imaging and communicating data, and also collecting samples.  The initial configuration is established, and I need to come up with a step-by-step procedure to satisfy the stated goal.
           
           **Re-evaluating Previous Failures and Obstacles**
           
           I've got a history here – prior attempts at this planning problem had issues with collision-free configurations, specifically with two configurations, `#o0` (communications) and `#o3` (imaging). Previous configurations were in collision with obstacles, or were simply unreachable. I've re-reviewed the problem description and key elements. I have a detailed list of objects and their locations, which is helpful. There are two critical obstacles: `v19` (an AABB) and `v20` (a vertical wall at x=0).  The initial starting configurations of the rovers have not changed. The objective is to image and communicate data from two targets (v17 and v18).  Furthermore, rocks (v1 and v5) have to be analysed from the rovers (v12 and v14).
           
           **Obstacle Avoidance and Reachability Considerations**

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Planning for Goal Achievement**
           
           My primary objective is to develop a comprehensive plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain. This goal demands that both rovers are returned to their initial configurations, their stores are free, images of objectives `v17` and `v18` have been received, and analyses of rocks `v1` (type `v2`) and `v5` (type `v6`) have been received. The initial state satisfies the positional and store conditions, so the key is determining how to receive the images and rock analyses, and then returning the rovers to their initial state.
           
           The core of my approach is to leverage the two rovers strategically. I will assign rover `v12` to the imaging and analysis of rock `v1`, and I will assign rover `v14` to the analysis of rock `v5`. The rovers must operate within specific constraints, including imaging distance (max 2), communication distance (max 4), reachability from current/previous configurations, and collision avoidance.
           
           **Configuration Selection:**
           
           The key is determining the new configurations for imaging `#o3` and communication `#o0`.
           
           *   **Imaging Configuration `#o3` for `v12` (targets `v17`, `v18`):**
           
               The current configuration of `v12` is (1.0, -1.75). I must find a collision-free location within a 2-unit radius of both targets. Given the current heading of the rover, I am considering an x position beyond the initial configuration, in the positive x direction, and an y position that aligns to be in the zone of the targets, `(1.2, 1.0)`. This point meets both conditions, it is within the reach of both targets, and is not within the collision regions specified in the constraints.
           
           *   **Communication Configuration `#o0` for `v12` and `v14` (target `v9`):**
           
               The Lander is centered at `(-1.9, -2.0)`. I must find a communication point within 4 units of the lander that is also reachable and collision-free. I chose coordinates `(-1.5, -1.0)`. This ensures that they both rovers are in range to the lander and are reachable from their initial state.
           
           **Plan Verification and Execution**
           
           The general plan:
           
           1.  `v12` moves to `#o3`.
           2.  `v12` images objectives.
           3.  `v12` moves to `#o0` and communicates image data.
           4.  `v12` moves to an intermediate state, takes the sample, and sends analysis data.
           5.  `v14` goes through a similar sequence for sampling `v5` and sending analysis data.
           6.  Each rover returns to their initial position.
           
           My analysis confirms that this sequence meets the goal requirements and all preconditions, and I am confident in my proposed plan.

(Thoughts: **The Crux of the Problem: Geometric Constraints and Unreachable Goals**
           
           I've been wrestling with this problem for a while now, and it's become clear that the fundamental issue lies in the geometric constraints imposed by the environment. The primary obstacle is the wall, `v20`, positioned at `x = 0`. This seemingly simple feature has a profound impact on the rovers' ability to achieve the goal.
           
           The initial state reveals a division: `v12` is situated at `x > 0`, and `v14` is at `x < 0`. This, combined with the stipulation that actions must be collision-free, means that neither rover can freely cross the `x = 0` barrier.
           
           My initial attempts involved positioning `v12` for imaging and communication. I quickly realized this was problematic. Specifically, imaging the targets (`v17` and `v18`) required `v12` to be in close proximity to, and on the same side as, those targets, which are exclusively located at `x > 0`. Consequently, to satisfy the `comvisible` precondition, I would have to attempt to position the rover close to the wall. This invariably leads to collisions because the wall prevents `v12` from sending information to the lander `v9`, which is located at `x < 0`.
           
           Moreover, the geometry dictates that imaging and communication tasks are mutually exclusive for each rover. Because `v14` is locked at `x < 0`, it cannot view the desired targets, and `v12` cannot send images. And even when I tried to put `v14` to perform some part of imaging, it can't cross the wall.
           
           The `blocked` predicate, a crucial aspect of the environment, relies on checking for collision-free communication rays. With the wall firmly in place, any attempt to establish a communication channel between a rover in `x > 0` and the lander in `x < 0` will fail. This directly conflicts with the goal requirements, specifically, the need for the rovers to *both* provide imaging, and *both* send analysis to the lander.
           
           Therefore, the problem is unsolvable with the provided structure. Neither rover can fulfill all the goal's requirements due to their inability to cross the physical divide imposed by `v20`. The communication and imaging tasks are inherently incompatible, rendering the goal unreachable.
