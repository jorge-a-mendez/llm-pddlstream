           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The task is clear: I need to get v8, v12, and v14 "on" v16.** This means each object must be supported by v16 and in the correct pose. I'll need to break this down for each object.
           
           First, I examined the initial state. v8 is on v11 in pose v9, v12 is on v11 in pose v13, and v14 is on v11 in pose v15. I see that v16 *can* support those objects, so that's the good news.
           
           To get each object "on" v16, I'll need to pick it up from its current location and place it on v16. I noticed the available actions are pick, place, move_base, clean, cook, but with this goal, cleaning and cooking aren't relevant. Since I *can* pick and place, I need to get the objects to the right pose with the robot hand empty, at the correct base configuration, and that I *can* move.
           
           **Now, let's look at the available actions and states.** I see that the robot needs to be at base configuration v3, and that v4 is the arm I need to use (specifically for the provided kin facts). The relevant *kin* facts tell me what trajectories and configurations I will need for each pick and place action, and I'll need to figure out how to resolve the continuous parameters. I can see the appropriate grasping pose for all three objects.
           
           With the facts in mind, I need to make the *plan*: pick v8 and place it on v16, pick v12 and place it on v16, pick v14 and place it on v16, with arm v4. Each 'pick' action requires that I be at bconf(v3) and have the hand empty. Each 'place' action requires that I be at bconf(v3) and have grasped the object. The `move_base` action doesn't seem required since I am already in the appropriate configuration and the action itself consumes and restores `canmove()` and doesn't change `atbconf`. In sum, assuming those continuous values are valid, the initial and goal states are correct and the robot is ready.
           
           So, here's the plan. I'll start with v8, pick it up from its initial location, and then place it on v16 at the pose defined by #o2. Then I'll move to v12, pick it up from its current spot, and then place it on the same target location, still using #o2. Finally, I'll perform the same pick and place for v14. Each step uses arm v4.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Re-Evaluating Goal Achievability with Limited Actions**
           
           Okay, the user's plan is invalid. I need to take another look at this. The objective is clear: I need to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` *on* `v16`. Specifically, `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)` must be true.
           
           I know how the `on` predicate works. It's an axiom, meaning to have `on(?o, ?r)`, I must have both `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)` be true.  So, to get `v8` *on* `v16`, I need it to be *supported* by something and *at* a particular pose on `v16`.
           
           Looking at the initial state, I can see that `v8` is currently supported by `#o2` and has its pose at `v9`. The same logic applies to `v12` and `v14`: They are currently supported by `#o2` but have poses at `v13` and `v15` respectively.
           
           To get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`, I need to change their `atpose` facts. Right now, they're not in the right position. `pick` and `place` actions would be the way to change that: `pick` negates the current `atpose` and `place` sets it. However, the *only* action I'm allowed to use is a `move_base` action, and that does *not* affect the `atpose` predicates. It only moves the robot.
           
           Therefore, because I can't change the `atpose` of `v8`, `v12`, or `v14` using `move_base`, I can't reach the target state. The goal is simply unachievable with the actions that are allowed.
