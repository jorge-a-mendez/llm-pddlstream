(Thoughts: **Planning to Achieve Multiple "On" Relations**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to get those three objects, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, all resting on `v16` in the correct positions.  It's a straightforward sequence, really, given the initial state.  The current situation is that all three objects are supported by `v11` at their respective positions (`v9`, `v13`, and `v15`). The robot's arm, `v4`, is currently empty and the robot is at `v3`.
           
           My approach is simple:
           
           1.  **Move the Base:** First, I've got to make sure I'm in the right spot to interact with these objects. My current base location is `v3`, but the actions require base configuration `#o3`, so I'll initiate a `move_base` action to get there.
           
           2.  **Pick, Place, Repeat:** Then I iterate. I'll focus on one object at a time. The common pattern is:
           
               *   **Pick:** Use the `pick` action to grasp the object from its initial location (off of `v11`).
               *   **Place:** Then `place` it onto `v16` at its required position using the `place` action.
           
           3.  **Specifics for Each Object:**  For `v8`, I'll move to the robot to `#o3`, then pick it up from `v9` and set it down in its spot on `v16` (position `#o2`).  Then I do the same for `v12` off of position `v13` and place it in the same way. The pattern repeats for `v14`, picking it up at `v15` and setting it on the `#o2` pose on `v16`.
           
           The precondition checking is pretty mechanical, ensuring that things like  `atbconf`, `handempty` and `kin` relations are satisfied before each action.  I have to note, if  `unsafe` conditions are given, I'll need to account for them. I assumed I have a safe trajectory and safe approach given the information I currently have.
           
           This should handle things.  Once all the "pick" and "place" actions are complete, I should achieve the required `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)` goals, given the support facts.
