           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The core of the problem is to get three objects (v8, v12, and v14) onto another object, v16.  Essentially, I need to rearrange these objects from their current positions, which are all on v11, to stack them on v16. Simple enough conceptually, right?
           
           But here's the snag: I'm stuck with a single, pretty useless action: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  This, essentially, does nothing useful. It consumes a `canmove()` predicate, which is necessary for actions but not essential here.
           
           The real issue is that I lack the key actions:  `pick` and `place`. These are *essential* for changing an object's location. The `pick` action would remove an object from its initial pose, and `place` would put it in a new one.  But these aren't available to me. And without these, I can't modify the crucial `atpose` predicates.
           
           Currently, I have these `atpose` facts: `atpose(v14, v15)`, `atpose(v12, v13)`, and `atpose(v8, v9)`. These indicate each object's starting position supported on v11. The goal requires these objects to be supported on v16, and the only path to do so involves the non-existent `pick` and `place` actions. 
           
           Since I can't *move* these objects, I can't fulfill the `on` goal. It's that straightforward.  I'm at an impasse. Therefore, I conclude the goal is unattainable with the available actions.
