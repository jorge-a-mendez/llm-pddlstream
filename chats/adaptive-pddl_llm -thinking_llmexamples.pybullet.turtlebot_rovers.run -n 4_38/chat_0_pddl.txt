           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, but looking at the definition, I see this is going to be tricky.  It hinges on a few key conditions: having images of four specific objectives (`receivedimage`), performing analyses of a stone and soil sample (`receivedanalysis`), and some initial state conditions that are, thankfully, already met.
           
           My first thought is to satisfy the image and analysis requirements. To get `receivedimage`, I'll need to use `send_image`.  That, in turn, hinges on having `haveimage` which is a product of `take_image`. The precondition for `take_image` involves being at a location where the objective is visible (`imagevisible`), having the correct camera calibrated, being `atconf` at the visibility location, and that the ray path is not blocked. It seems to have prerequisites of `calibrate` actions to be properly done.
           
           Similarly, `receivedanalysis` demands `send_analysis` which in turn requires `analyzed` predicate. The best bet here is to use `sample_rock`.
           
           Now, here's where the problem arises.  All the `imagevisible` and `above` predicates point to configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, or `#o5`. But both rovers, `v12` and `v14`, are stuck at `v13` and `v15`, respectively. My only move actions are the no-ops that preserve this state!
           
           I've examined the move actions and I have noticed they are all no-op actions. They don't change the rovers' configuration.
           
           I need the rovers, `v12` and `v14`, at these configuration, specifically to take images, and samples. But these `move` actions will not bring me there. Therefore, `calibrate`, `take_image`, `sample_rock` are unachievable.
           
           Since I can't get to those locations, I cannot take images or perform any analyses. This blocks me from satisfying  `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`. These are the requirements of the axiom `new-axiom@0()`.
           
           Therefore, based on the provided actions and the current initial state, achieving `new-axiom@0()` is currently *impossible*. I'm stuck, and I need to communicate this conclusion clearly.
