           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Plan for Object Placements**
           
           I need to place an object (ID 4) onto a surface (0) 50 times in a stable manner. The surface is a square of size 0.27 centered at (0,0), and the object is a square of approximately 0.0865. To find stable placements, I'll calculate a bounding box around the object for different orientations and ensure the placement remains fully within the surface area. I'll represent each placement as (surf_idx, theta, x, y).
           
           Since the object is almost square, I'll make the key simplification that its effective size, `h`, is `0.5 * obj_s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`, where `obj_s = 0.0865`. The object AABB will always have sides of equal length. By calculating different `h` values for a set of angles, I can compute the safe `x` and `y` center placement ranges.
           
           For the 50 placements, I've decided to use three rotation angles: 0, pi/6, and pi/4. I'll calculate the valid x and y range limits for these angles, then I'll generate a grid of positions within the valid range for each angle. With the use of a grid approach for x and y locations, I am confident that I can achieve the request and find all the necessary valid locations.  Finally, I will generate the list of `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)` positions.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Object Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's my plan for placing this new object (ID 5) while avoiding collisions with the previously placed one (ID 4), which is located at approximately `(-0.0917, -0.0917)` on the surface. I'll need to remember that object 4 occupies the bottom-left corner of surface 0, from `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(-0.0485, -0.0485)`.  ID 5 has an almost square shape with side `0.09659025`.
           
           I'll start by calculating the dimensions of the bounding box around object 4. Then, for the new object, I'll generate placement candidates at three different rotation angles: `0`, `pi/6`, and `pi/4`. For each angle, I need to account for rotation and calculate the resulting half-extents of the object's bounding box.  
           
           For each rotation, I'll define the valid range for the center coordinates `(x, y)` on the surface, keeping in mind the surface limits (`-0.135` to `0.135`). To avoid collisions,  the approach is to generate a grid of potential `(x, y)` coordinates at a range and filter placements that are close to where object 4 is located.
           
           I've determined that the placement will require a grid. For `theta = 0`, I calculate a threshold for `x` and `y` (-0.000176) to define the forbidden region (a small "corner" where overlap is guaranteed). I use a 5x5 grid (25 total points) and then filter the ones overlapping the bottom-left corner of surface 0 occupied by object 4:  That leaves 21 valid placements for that rotation.
           
           Similarly, I generated a 5x5 grid to find valid placement locations for `theta = pi/6` and `theta = pi/4`.  For these two rotations, I determine the `x_threshold` and `y_threshold` coordinates and avoid the bottom-left corners as well. 9 point will overlap for each rotation, and only the remaining 16 will be added. 
           
           With 21 placement possibilities for 0 degrees, and 16 possibilities for pi/6 and pi/4, the total is 53 valid places. The first 50 positions can be used to meet the requirement.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I need to place Object 6 a total of 50 times on Surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into either Object 4 or Object 5, which are already in place. My initial thought is to tackle this by strategically setting the rotation (theta) of Object 6 and then running a grid search to find valid positions.
           
           First, I figured out the relevant surface dimensions and the sizes of Object 4, Object 5, and Object 6.  I made sure to calculate the AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) for Objects 4 and 5 because they're already set at a theta of 0, which makes calculating these easier. Then, I summarized the occupied space. Object 4 is down in the left corner. Object 5 is to the right and above it. This means the left part of the surface has the most restrictions.
           
           I know I have to keep the object centered within bounds, so I figured out the valid x and y center ranges, which depend on the rotation.
           
           Now, my approach is to try out different theta values: 0, pi/6, and pi/4. For each theta, I have to calculate a new 'h' value, which is like the half-width of the rotated object.  I'll then set up a grid of potential x, y coordinates within the allowable surface space.
           
           For theta = 0, with that easy rotation, I found a 10x10 grid worked nicely, and I set the valid x-y coordinates in a numpy array.  Then, I ran each grid point through a check where I compared the box of Object 6's position with those of Objects 4 and 5 to see if any boxes overlap.
           
           I then did the collision checking calculations as described above to determine if they overlap with the previously placed objects. This means, the center `(x, y)` has a valid object if the object's box doesn't overlap those of other objects.
           
           This also applies to theta = pi/6 and pi/4, with 7x7 grids and collision checks. Finally, I will choose 20 valid placements from theta = 0, 15 from pi/6, and 15 from pi/4 to meet the 50 total.
