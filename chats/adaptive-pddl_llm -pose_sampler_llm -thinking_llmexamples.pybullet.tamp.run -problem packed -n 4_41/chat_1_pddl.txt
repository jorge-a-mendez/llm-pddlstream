           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Stacking Strategy**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` all stacked on `v18`. From the facts, I see that these objects are all graspable, the robot has two arms (though only one, `v4`, has the necessary kinematic information), and they're initially supported on a common object, `v11`.  Crucially, all these objects *can* be placed on `v18`.  Furthermore, a common target pose, `#o2`, is available for them, and that pose is indeed supported by `v18`.
           
           My strategy will be straightforward:  I'll just pick each object, one by one, using arm `v4` and place it at `#o2`. Since the robot's base can't move (it's staying at configuration `v3`), I don't need to consider any base movements or adjustments.  I can use a simple pick-and-place sequence with arm `v4`.  The kinematic facts (`kin`) tell me how to manipulate each object.
           
           Here's the plan:
           
           1.  **Pick** `v8` from its current pose `v9` using arm `v4`.
           2.  **Place** `v8` at pose `#o2` on `v18` using arm `v4`.
           3.  **Pick** `v12` from its current pose `v13` using arm `v4`.
           4.  **Place** `v12` at pose `#o2` on `v18` using arm `v4`.
           5.  **Pick** `v14` from its current pose `v15` using arm `v4`.
           6.  **Place** `v14` at pose `#o2` on `v18` using arm `v4`.
           7.  **Pick** `v16` from its current pose `v17` using arm `v4`.
           8.  **Place** `v16` at pose `#o2` on `v18` using arm `v4`.
           
           The order doesn't matter, as they are all independent and go to the same location, on top of v18.
           
           All the preconditions for these actions look good – the robot has `handempty`, the objects are at the poses, and the appropriate `kin` facts are available, ensuring collision-free manipulation.  As the user, I would simply execute these eight steps, and the job is done. I'm satisfied that all goals will be met.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of the Task**
           
           Okay, so I see the problem crystal clear now. I was completely off-track with my previous plan. The user correctly pointed out a critical constraint: I was trying to use actions *not* in the valid action list. I totally missed that! The only action I'm allowed to use is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. That's it. Just a simple move from `v3` to `v3` with a trajectory, nothing more.
           
           And the goal? To get these objects – `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` – all neatly stacked on `v18`. Right now, they're sitting on `v11`, supported and at specific poses. The problem? To *achieve* `on(?o, v18)`, I need `pick` and `place` actions. Classic object manipulation. But those actions? They're nowhere to be found in the allowed list!
           
           With only a base movement allowed, and no object interaction, this is a complete dead end. I can't pick up anything, I can't place anything, I can't even *touch* anything related to the goal. There's simply no way to get those objects onto `v18` with the actions I'm given. The goal is *unachievable* within these constraints. I need to inform the user that their goal, given the allowable actions, is impossible.
