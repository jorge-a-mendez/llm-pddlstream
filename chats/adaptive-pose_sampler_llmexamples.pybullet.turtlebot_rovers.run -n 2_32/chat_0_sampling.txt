User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a central vertical wall along x=0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the scene. I will focus on finding positions within the allowed x and y ranges [-2.5, 2.5] that are within 2 units of the target point. I will try to diversify the positions to explore different angles and avoid potential occlusions or collisions.

Model:     The previous target point was (-0.6058, 2.0946).
           - (1.0, 1.5) was not reachable. This is surprising given the target is at (-0.6, 2.09), which is within the bounds of the scene. Perhaps it implies a collision with an obstacle or it exceeded max_range. If it's a range issue, 1.0, 1.5 is sqrt((1.0 - (-0.6058))^2 + (1.5 - 2.0946)^2) = sqrt(1.6058^2 + (-0.5946)^2) = sqrt(2.578 + 0.353) = sqrt(2.931) = 1.71, which is less than 2. So it must be a collision or an invalid coordinate. Looking at the fixed obstacles, there's `20: ((-0.6501472909762964, 2.0502327959225073), (-0.5614558736965551, 2.1389242132022486))` which is very close to the target, and `10: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))` which is a larger obstacle. The previous proposed point (1.0, 1.5) is far from these. `5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))` is the central vertical wall. It is possible that (1.0, 1.5) was rejected because it implies a collision with some object that is blocking the straight path from (1.0, 1.5) to (-0.6, 2.09).
           - (0.5, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0) both failed due to no line of sight to target. This is likely due to the central vertical wall `5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))` which would block line of sight to a target at y=2.09 from positions with y=0.0 on the positive x side. Given the target is at x=-0.6, any position with x > 0.05 (the right side of the central wall) will have its line of sight blocked by this wall. Therefore, I should focus on positions with negative x values to view the target at (-0.6058, 2.0946).
           
           For the new target point, I will consider its position relative to the central wall and previous failures.

Model:     The previous request was for target point (2.1243, 2.1806).
           - (-1.0, 1.5), (-0.5, 0.5) failed due to no line of sight. This is expected given the central vertical wall (x=0) and the target being at x=2.1243.
           - (-2.0, 2.0) collided with obstacle 8: ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)). This is good information as it marks off a section of the upper left quadrant.
           
           For the current target point, (1.812328224182129, -1.8906649351119995), I need to find positions that are within 2 units, within x,y bounds, and avoid known obstacles. The target is in the lower right quadrant.
           
           I will try positions in the lower right quadrant. The target is close to obstacle `11: ((1.9506209409510848, -1.4743073665821793), (2.0904094660008194, -1.3345188415324447))`, `14: ((1.3233829058540918, -0.6564567767249486), (1.4626097165213965, -0.5172299660576442))`, `18: ((0.412404831098517, -1.9609047513733306), (0.5533074181805052, -1.8200021642913422))` and `13: ((-0.6131263240378736, -2.3100398047965407), (-0.4717077747780443, -2.1686212555367113))`. I will try to stay clear of these.
