           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Here's how I'm thinking about this placement problem:**
           
           I need to find 50 stable positions for object ID 8 on a flat surface. The surface is a square AABB defined by its minimum and maximum coordinates, and the object is nearly square with dimensions just a bit larger than 0.09. A placement consists of the surface index (0 in this case), the rotation angle `theta`, and the `(x, y)` coordinates for the center of the object's AABB.
           
           The core of the problem is figuring out where I can place the object while keeping it entirely within the surface boundary.  I've got to consider the effect of rotating the object.  The key is that the dimensions of the object's AABB change as it rotates – I've got to calculate the "rotated width" and "rotated height" for each possible angle.  The key is, for a given `theta`, the effective AABB will vary, and since the object is nearly square, the change will be smaller for various rotations.
           
           With that in mind, I need to work out the valid region for the center of the object's AABB for a given `theta`.  I've calculated the minimum and maximum `x` and `y` center positions, taking into account the surface boundaries and the object's rotated dimensions.
           
           Since I need 50 placements and rotation angle is a factor, I'll generate a grid of `(x, y)` locations and vary the rotation to maximize the variety of the object placements. I'll sample a range of rotations, making sure to spread them out evenly to cover the full range of possible orientations. I'll pick a few rotations such as 0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, pi/2, and their reflections. Then I'll generate samples by sampling the x and y coordinates with equal spacing within the valid ranges. Finally, I generate the placements in the right format.
           
           With the grid of `(x, y)` pairs, and the range of angles, I can guarantee that I'll have 50 unique placements that meet the criteria.  Since the object is almost square, I can be relatively sure that I get a good distribution, given that the boundary conditions will vary only a little.

(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements for Object ID 4 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've got a new request: find 50 stable positions for object ID 4 on surface 0.  I've got to avoid colliding with the previously placed object, ID 8, which is at `(0, 0.0, -0.08886671345405838, -0.08886671345405838)`.  Let's break this down.
           
           First, I analyze the surface. It's a square centered at (0,0) with sides of 0.27. Now, for the new object (ID 4), it's also a square with a side length of approximately 0.097.  That means the half-extent is 0.048.  Since this object is much smaller than the surface, it *could* fit anywhere, but I need to avoid the collision.
           
           I know Object ID 8's extents from a previous analysis, and it's snugly placed in the bottom-left corner of the surface.  Since it's placed at `theta=0`, its AABB is simply centered at `(-0.0888, -0.0888)` with dimensions `obj8_size_x` and `obj8_size_y`. I need to generate placements that avoid its AABB.
           
           To do this, I need to focus on preventing the AABB's from overlapping. I will generate positions in quadrants/regions around object 8. Object 4’s orientation does not matter. The valid range for placing is `[-0.0866, 0.0866]`. I’ll create a grid of potential `(x, y)` centers. I have to create this grid and filter out any points that collide. It looks like it would make sense to place the object to the right and above object 8 or its upper right region.
           
           Given that object 4 is also square, the maximum AABB dimension won’t change with rotations (theta).  I'll generate several angle values for diversity. I then need to generate a dense grid and check each position to see if the two objects' AABBs collide.
           
           I'll calculate the valid ranges for the object's center. I'll test all combinations of x, y, and theta and determine if they collide by using a filter. I'll generate a grid, checking for collisions within the existing object's AABB.
           
           I know object 8 is placed at the bottom-left corner, and is square shaped. I also know that all positions to the right and above it should be free. To determine collision, the check of `obj4_aabb_max_x > obj8_min_x` AND `obj4_aabb_min_x < obj8_max_x` AND `obj4_aabb_max_y > obj8_min_y` AND `obj4_aabb_min_y < obj8_max_y` determines collision, for which the code has been written.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 5) on surface 0, while carefully avoiding collisions with two already placed objects (ID 8 and ID 4).
           
           **Problem Setup:**
           Surface 0 is a square, centered at the origin, with sides of 0.27 units. The new object is also a square, with dimensions of about 0.079 units per side. I've calculated the half-extents (0.039) for ease of calculations.
           
           **Occupied Space Analysis:**
           First, I analyzed the occupied space to determine the best placement candidates. Object 8 is located in the bottom-left corner of the surface and Object 4 is in the bottom-middle. I have determined the bounding box ranges (AABB) for both objects and combined the regions to find the best free regions. I know that the objects overlap and create an area of the surface where the new square can't be placed.
           
           **Collision Detection:**
           I'm using a standard AABB collision check. Given the AABBs of the new object and the existing objects, I will see whether the candidate locations collide. The existing objects and the new object can be rotated, so this information will be used in calculations.
           1. Define a function to check if any two bounding boxes overlap.
           2. The grid of candidates is generated using a linear space array of x and y points that are sampled and iterated.
           3. For each candidate (x, y) location on the surface I'll convert it to bounding box form and check for collisions.
           
           **Sampling Strategy:**
           I will try to place the object 50 times using a methodical approach. First, I define a fine grid of points across the surface. Then, I iterate through these points, considering potential rotations (0, pi/4, pi/2, 3*pi/4, pi). For each point, I check for collisions with the existing objects using my AABB collision check. If a collision is found, I skip that location; otherwise, I add it to the list of potential placements.
           
           **Grid Generation:**
           I'm generating a fine grid of 15 x 15 points using numpy's `linspace` function. I do the sampling systematically using the x and y dimensions. The `x_coords` and `y_coords` are in a valid placement range within the scene. I am now working on generating many values along the valid range.
           
           The plan is to check these candidate placements systematically, using the AABB collision function.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 7**
           
           My primary goal is to find 50 stable, non-colliding placements for object 7 on surface 0, taking into account the existing objects 8, 4, and 5. Surface 0 is a square with an AABB of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. Object 7 is essentially a square with a size of `0.09897638475747289` x `0.09897638475747292`, which results in a half extent of roughly `0.049`.
           
           First, I need to visualize the space occupied by the existing objects. Object 8 has an AABB of `((-0.135, -0.135), (-0.0427, -0.0427))`, meaning the bottom-left corner of the surface is occupied. Object 4 has an AABB of `((-0.0366, -0.135), (0.0602, -0.0382))`, occupying a region in the bottom-middle. Object 5 has an AABB of `((-0.135, -0.0307), (-0.0562, 0.0481))`, covering the left-middle of the surface.
           
           To locate feasible placements for object 7, I'll calculate the valid center ranges for its position, considering its half-extents. Object 7's AABB will change with rotation, so I need to account for that. Given that it is close to a square, the maximal AABB can be computed for a pi/4 rotation. I will also incorporate rotations from 0 to pi using increments.
           
           I will define the following functions: `get_rotated_bbox_dims` to determine the bounding box dimensions based on object dimensions and a provided angle and `check_collision` to determine if two AABBs are intersecting. I'll use a loop to iterate through a pre-defined set of angles from 0 to pi.  For each angle, I will determine the corresponding object half-width and half-height for each rotation, and the bounds of valid placements to generate evenly-spaced center coordinate locations. I will check for collision between each candidate location with all previously placed objects, to determine the position of the new object. If the placement is valid (no collision), I will store the position and move on until I reach the required number of placements.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**
           
           Alright, the task is clear: I need to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 6) on a given square surface, avoiding collisions with the existing objects. The surface is centered at (0,0) with side length 0.27, and the object itself has a side length of approximately 0.072.
           
           My first step is to accurately characterize the constraints.  I'll start by determining the effective bounding box (AABB) of the object, taking its rotations into account.  Since the object is square, the effective AABB will vary depending on the rotation.  I'll need to consider both the object's original body-frame dimensions and how those dimensions are projected into the world frame with each possible rotation.  The max rotated bounding box will be crucial.
           
           Next, I'll analyze the space occupied by the existing objects. This requires calculating the AABBs of all previously placed objects, each of which might have its own rotation.  For rotated objects, I'll calculate the rotated width and rotated height.
           
           **Collision Detection Strategy**
           
           To avoid collisions, I'll formulate a robust strategy for placement generation and collision checking.  I will iterate over a set of candidate placements, each specified by an x-coordinate, a y-coordinate, and a rotation angle (theta). For each candidate placement, I will:
           
           1.  **Calculate the AABB:** Determine the AABB of the new object given its position and rotation.
           2.  **Collision Check:** Compare the new AABB to the AABBs of all existing objects. If there is no overlap, I add this to the list of safe positions.
           
           **Placement Generation and Refinement**
           
           For generating potential placements, I'll follow a systematic approach.  I will define valid regions for the object's center, based on the rotation angle, in order to maximize the surface utilization. I'll define a suitable grid to generate a good variety of potential coordinates. I will also make sure to use a variety of rotation candidates to cover various configurations.
           
           To improve the accuracy and efficiency of the collision checks, I'll start with an early exit condition, and I will keep the existing and candidate bounding boxes as accurate as possible to make the best decision.
           
           The goal is to generate placements within the valid ranges and efficiently check for collisions with a suitable number of sampling points and rotations. The code will then generate placements in a form that makes sense given this specific task.
