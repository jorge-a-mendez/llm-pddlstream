           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.389, 0.357), (-4.291, 0.455)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.34, 0.406, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.315, 0.949).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((3.036, -1.018), (4.394, 0.073)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Goal Breakdown**
           
           Okay, let's get this rolling. The objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, but that's just a shorthand. Breaking it down, we're aiming for `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. Luckily, the initial state shows that `type(?green, v17)` is already true, so our focus shifts to getting `on(?green, v18)`. Easy enough, right?  The fact that both axioms for `new-axiom@0()` are the same reinforces that we're dealing with a singular concept.
           
           **Object Instantiation and Simplification**
           
           It appears `?green` needs to be replaced. Looking at the initial state,  `Atom type(v12, v17)` is available, so we can replace `?green` with `v12`.  Boom, the goal is now simplified to `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           **Action Decomposition and Pre-Planning**
           
           We've got to figure out how to get `v12` onto `v18`.  The knowledge base tells us that `on` translates to needing  `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)` - meaning, we need `v12` to be at some pose `?p` supported by `v18`.
           
           **State Examination and Pose Discovery**
           
           Examining the initial state, we find several relevant facts: `supported(v12, v13, v14)` (meaning it's *on* something, just not *where* we want it),  `atpose(v12, v13)` (it's *somewhere*), `stackable(v12, v18)` (we can put it on v18).  Critically, `pose(v12, #o2)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` exist, meaning that `v12` can be supported on `v18` at some pose `#o2`.  This tells me we want  `atpose(v12, #o2)` which, when combined with `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`, will satisfy the `on` constraint and give us the result.
           
           **Robot Action Selection and the Plan**
           
           We need to get `v12` from its current pose `v13` to `#o2`. This screams "pick and place." The robot has two arms: `v4` and `v6`.  Focusing on `v4` for now, there are `kin` facts that include possible base configs and the pick/place actions with respect to our object of interest.  Looking at those, we can see `((pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4))` and  `((place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4))` are available to us. Great! The preconditions for each look straightforward, like `handempty`, etc.
           
           **Precondition Checking and the Crucial Assumption**
           
           The key is ensuring the preconditions hold.  We have `atpose(v12, v13)`, which allows us to pick the object up. The main concern, though, is `atbconf(#o3)`.  The problem statement mentions that facts *not* explicitly stated are false. So, *technically*, this would fail.  However, the `kin` facts all use `#o3`, suggesting that's the robot's default base configuration for this task, so for now, I'm assuming it's true. This may require additional steps if it's the wrong interpretation, but at present, it seems most logical based on the available information.
           
           **Plan Formulation and Execution Simulation**
           
           Given the above, the plan looks like this:
           1.  `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           2.  `place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           Now, the effect of the pick will change `v12`'s state from `atpose(v12, v13)` to `atgrasp(v4, v12, #o1)`, and free up `v4`.  Then, the place action will move it to `#o2`.
           
           **Continuous Value Determination and Pose Definition**
           
           We need to actually *define* `#o2`. I need to figure out its coordinates. Let's look at the given AABBs. We have `v12` whose AABB is ((-

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', #o3) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Unreachable State: A Circular Dependency**
           
           Okay, I've got it. The previous plan failed, and it's clear why: the system explicitly states that `atbconf(#o3)` is *false* in the initial state, and I was incorrectly assuming it was true. This is a crucial detail that I missed at first.
           
           Looking closely at the initial state, I see that we have `Atom canmove()` and `Atom bconf(#o3)`.  The `bconf(#o3)` is just a type declaration, it doesn't give us any useful information here. My attention quickly turns to `move_base`:
           
           ```
           move_base(?q1: object, ?q2: object, ?t: object)
           Precondition:
             Atom basemotion(?q1, ?t, ?q2)
             Atom atbconf(?q1)
             Atom canmove()
           Effects:
             Atom atbconf(?q2)
             NegatedAtom atbconf(?q1)
             NegatedAtom canmove()
           ```
           
           The key here is that `move_base` *requires* `atbconf(?q1)` as a precondition.  In my available actions, the only valid `move_base` action is `(move_base #o3 #o3 #o0)`. For this to execute, `atbconf(#o3)` must be true.  But... it's *not* in the initial state.
           
           Then I recalled the problem description explicitly states: "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is *false*." This means that *no* `pick` or `place` action is possible, since they all require `atbconf(#o3)`. And, as I've established, no `move_base` can execute because of this circular dependency. `atbconf(#o3)` is needed as a precondition to *any* action available, it is not present in the initial state, and can only be set true via the effects of a valid move base, which requires an `atbconf` in the first place!
           
           I double-checked the action definitions to confirm: `pick`, `place`, and `move_base` all require `atbconf(#o3)`.  This strongly suggests the goal state is *unreachable* under the given conditions. I see no way out of this catch-22.  I think it is a bug in the problem generation, or I need to make some assumptions about the initial state, or I am missing an assumption about how `atbconf` is used within this planning domain.
