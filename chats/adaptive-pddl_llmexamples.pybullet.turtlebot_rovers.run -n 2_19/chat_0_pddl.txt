           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which, by examining the axioms, means that the following conditions must be met:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover v12 is at configuration v13.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover v14 is at configuration v15.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: Rover v12 has a free store v16.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: Rover v14 has a free store v16.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: Image of objective v17 in mode v11 has been received.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Image of objective v18 in mode v11 has been received.
           7. `type(?stone, v2)`: There exists an object of type v2 (stone).
           8. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: Analysis of an object of type v2 (stone) has been received.
           9. `type(?soil, v6)`: There exists an object of type v6 (soil).
           10. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: Analysis of an object of type v6 (soil) has been received.
           
           Let's analyze the initial state against these goal conditions:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: True (initial state).
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: True (initial state).
           - `free(v12, v16)`: True (initial state).
           - `free(v14, v16)`: True (initial state).
           
           So, the first four conditions are already met. We need to focus on conditions 5, 6, 8, and 10.
           
           For `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           To achieve `receivedimage`, the rover must first `take_image` and then `send_image`.
           The preconditions for `take_image`:
           - `imagevisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o)`
           - `onboard(?c, ?v)`
           - `supports(?c, ?m)`
           - `atconf(?v, ?q)`
           - `calibrated(?c, ?v)`
           - `~blocked(?y)`
           
           The preconditions for `send_image`:
           - `comvisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l)`
           - `objective(?o)`
           - `mode(?m)`
           - `haveimage(?v, ?o, ?m)`
           - `atconf(?v, ?q)`
           - `~blocked(?y)`
           
           From the initial state, we have:
           - `rover(v12)`, `rover(v14)`
           - `objective(v17)`, `objective(v18)`
           - `mode(v11)`
           - `onboard(v10, v12)`, `onboard(v10, v14)` (v10 is the camera)
           - `supports(v10, v11)`
           - `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           - `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           - `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`, `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` (v9 is the lander)
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`, `atconf(v12, v13)`
           - `ray(#o4)`, `ray(#o1)`
           - `conf(v14, #o3)`, `conf(v12, #o3)`, `conf(v14, #o0)`, `conf(v12, #o0)`
           
           No `blocked` predicates are present, so `~blocked` is true by default.
           No `calibrated` predicates are present, so we need to calibrate the camera.
           
           For `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`:
           To achieve `receivedanalysis`, the rover must first `sample_rock` and then `send_analysis`.
           The preconditions for `sample_rock`:
           - `above(?v, ?q, ?r)`
           - `store(?s)`
           - `atconf(?v, ?q)`
           - `free(?v, ?s)`
           
           The preconditions for `send_analysis`:
           - `comvisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l)`
           - `rock(?r)`
           - `analyzed(?v, ?r)`
           - `atconf(?v, ?q)`
           - `~blocked(?y)`
           
           From the initial state, we have:
           - `rock(v7)`, `rock(v5)`, `rock(v4)`, `rock(v3)`, `rock(v1)`, `rock(v8)`
           - `type(v1, v2)`, `type(v4, v2)`, `type(v3, v2)` (these are "stone" type rocks)
           - `type(v8, v6)`, `type(v5, v6)`, `type(v7, v6)` (these are "soil" type rocks)
           - `above(v14, #o5, v3)` (v3 is stone)
           - `above(v14, #o5, v8)` (v8 is soil)
           - `above(v12, #o5, v3)` (v3 is stone)
           - `above(v12, #o5, v8)` (v8 is soil)
           - `store(v16)`
           - `free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)`
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`, `atconf(v12, v13)`
           - `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`, `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           - `ray(#o1)`
           
           No `analyzed` predicates are present, so we need to sample the rocks.
           
           Let's use rover `v14` for image tasks and sampling for both stone and soil. It's already at `v15` which is where it can access the rocks. For image taking, `v14` is at `v15` and `imagevisible` uses `#o3`, so we need to calibrate at `#o3`. For communication, `comvisible` uses `#o0`. We'll assume the ray for communication `#o1` is not blocked.
           
           Plan:
           1. Calibrate camera `v10` on rover `v14` for objective `v17` at conf `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           2. Take image of `v17` with `v14` using camera `v10` in mode `v11` at conf `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           3. Send image of `v17` with `v14` to lander `v9` at conf `#o0` with ray `#o1`.
           4. Calibrate camera `v10` on rover `v14` for objective `v18` at conf `#o3` with ray `#o4`. (Calibration is undone after taking an image)
           5. Take image of `v18` with `v14` using camera `v10` in mode `v11` at conf `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           6. Send image of `v18` with `v14` to lander `v9` at conf `#o0` with ray `#o1`.
           
           Now for sampling:
           7. Sample rock `v3` (type v2, stone) with rover `v14` at conf `#o5` using store `v16`.
           8. Send analysis of rock `v3` with rover `v14` to lander `v9` at conf `#o0` with ray `#o1`.
           9. Drop rock from store `v16` on rover `v14` to free the store.
           10. Sample rock `v8` (type v6, soil) with rover `v14` at conf `#o5` using store `v16`.
           11. Send analysis of rock `v8` with rover `v14` to lander `v9` at conf `#o0` with ray `#o1`.
           
           All required conditions should be met. No `move` actions are needed as `v14` is already at `v15` and `v12` is at `v13`, and the necessary configurations for sampling and imaging (e.g., `#o3`, `#o5`, `#o0`) are associated with `v14`'s current location (`v15`) or `v12`'s current location (`v13`) and are used in the given `imagevisible`, `above`, `comvisible` facts.
           
           Let's check the available actions: only `move` and `drop_rock` actions are available. This means that if we need to take images, calibrate, sample rocks or send data, those actions should be in the initial available action instances. Since they are not, the plan I devised is not executable. The goal `new-axiom@0()` includes `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates, which require actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. None of these actions are available in the provided list of allowed action instances, except `drop_rock` (which only helps in freeing a store, but the stores are already free and we need to *sample* first, then drop). The `move` actions also don't help in achieving the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` goals, and the existing `atconf` are already satisfying parts of the goal.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the given limited set of allowed actions.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires `receivedimage` for two objectives and `receivedanalysis` for a stone and a soil.
           The initial state already satisfies:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`
           - `free(v12, v16)`
           - `free(v14, v16)`
           - `type(v1, v2)`, `type(v4, v2)`, `type(v3, v2)` (stone types exist)
           - `type(v8, v6)`, `type(v5, v6)`, `type(v7, v6)` (soil types exist)
           
           The remaining unsatisfied conditions are:
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`, the actions `take_image` and `send_image` are required.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis`, the actions `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` are required.
           
           However, the list of allowed action instances provided is:
           - `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`
           - `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`
           - `(drop_rock v12 v16)`
           - `(drop_rock v14 v16)`
           
           None of the necessary actions (`take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`, `calibrate`) are present in this list. The `move` actions would simply move a rover from one configuration to the same configuration, effectively doing nothing to change the state relevant to the goal. The `drop_rock` actions would make a full store free, but in the initial state, both `v12` and `v14` have `free(v16)`, so `drop_rock` is not applicable or useful without prior `sample_rock` actions. Since these critical actions are missing, the goal is not achievable.
