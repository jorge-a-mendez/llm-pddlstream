User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Initial Thoughts on Finding Robot Positions**
           
           Okay, here's the deal. I've got to find three good spots, three base positions, for a robot to hang out near a target point.  This is all happening within a 5x5 area, basically.  The catch?  I've got a maximum range of 2 units from the target point and have to avoid hitting any of those pesky fixed obstacles.  Oh, and the robot's orientation is automatically facing the target, so that's one less thing to worry about.
           
           First, I need to get a handle on the layout.  I'm given a bunch of axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) that define the obstacles.  There's the outer boundary, some walls, and smaller scattered blocks.  I've noted that the AABB that defines the boundaries of the environment at (-2.5, -2.5) to (2.5, 2.5) isn't necessarily an object to collide with (or at least, I'm treating it this way). It's more of a playable area, the x,y bounds.
           
           My plan? First, I'm going to generate a bunch of candidate spots near the target, all within that max range. Then, I'll start filtering these candidates:
           
           *   **Bounds Check:** Make sure they're within the valid x and y range which is \[-2.5, 2.5\].
           *   **Collision Detection:** Check if the candidate spot is inside any of the obstacles I've been given, using those AABBs.
           *   **Line-of-Sight:** This is where it gets interesting.  I need to check if there's a clear, unobstructed path (a line) from the candidate spot to the target.  This means making sure the line-of-sight doesn't intersect any obstacles.
           
           For the line-of-sight part, I'm using a fairly standard approach. I check if the line segment from the candidate to the target passes through any of the AABBs. I'll utilize a function that checks for a line-AABB intersection. Importantly, if the target point happens to be within an obstacle, it won't count as blocked for LOS because the goal is to view, not prevent visibility of, the target.
           
           Once I've got my three valid positions – those that clear the boundary constraints, collision tests, and line-of-sight requirements – I'm good to go!
