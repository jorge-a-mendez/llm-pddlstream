           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.299, 0.019), (-0.223, 0.095)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.242, 0.39, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.679, 0.734).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.179, -0.335, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.728, 0.685).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.261, 0.057, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.673, 0.74).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.205, 0.352), (0.28, 0.428)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.216, -0.372), (-0.142, -0.298)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's my approach to this placement problem. The core task is to get objects v8, v12, and v14 onto surface v16, specifically at these defined poses. I need to use the robot's arm, v4, to move each object from its starting point on surface v11. The robot's current base configuration is v3, with arm configuration v5, and its hand is empty.
           
           Given the constraints, the best strategy is a straightforward "pick and place" sequence for each object. We need to move the robot base to a suitable pick/place configuration, then pick each object in turn and set it onto v16. We'll start by determining this pick/place configuration, called #o3, based on the provided kinematic information, likely near the workspace. The move_base is only needed initially.
           
           Let's dissect this plan for one object, v8, as a template:
           
           1.  **Move Base (if needed):** I'll start by moving the robot base from v3 to base configuration #o3 using `move_base`.
           
           2.  **Pick v8:** The action `pick` will grab v8 from its initial pose, v9, using arm v4. I'll need to make sure the robot can reach and grasp v8 from #o3, which requires satisfying the `kin` predicate.
           
           3.  **Place v8:** The `place` action then puts v8 onto v16 at the new pose I designate for v8 (`#o2`). This assumes the hand is still holding the object and the robot remains at #o3.
           
           I'll repeat this for v12 and v14, placing them on v16 sequentially.
           
           Now, a key point arises regarding the placement pose `#o2`. While the problem initially suggests a single symbolic pose, `#o2`, I realize I need separate continuous values for each object on v16. So I need to supply different specific poses for each. I'll need to define distinct poses on v16: #o2_v8, #o2_v12, and #o2_v14. I'll ensure these poses are collision-free and within v16's boundaries.
           
           The main challenge is to determine suitable positions for these objects, considering the dimensions and avoiding collisions. Since v16 is a square table of 27cm x 27cm, and the objects' footprints are 7.5cm x 7.6cm (v8), 7.6cm x 7.6cm (v12), and 7.4cm x 7.4cm (v14), I will ensure they can fit, I should avoid overlap and place them close to each other. I'll arrange them in a linear configuration with a suitable gap between each object, ensuring stable placement.
           
           Given the existing poses, I'll estimate the `z` coordinate to be the surface height of v16, based on the objects' z coordinate in their initial poses.
           
           The overall action sequence, combining all the specifics, should be:
           
           1.  Move to base configuration #o3 (if needed).
           2.  Pick v8 from v9.
           3.  Place v8 at pose #o2\_v8 on v16.
           4.  Pick v12 from v13.
           5.  Place v12 at pose #o2\_v12 on v16.
           6.  Pick v14 from v15.
           7.  Place v14 at pose #o2\_v14 on v16.
           
           **Specific Poses**
           
           For placement, I'll put the robot close to the objects, on the edge of the tabletop v16, so the `z` dimension is the surface height. The x and y values are relative to the center of v16.
           
           *   #o2\_v8: (0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   #o2\_v12: (0.0, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   #o2\_v14: (0.0, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           
           With this plan, each object will be picked and then placed sequentially, resulting in the correct configuration to achieve the stated goal, to have each object placed on v16.
