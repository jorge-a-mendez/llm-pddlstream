           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've come up with to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()` in the rovers domain:**
           
           First, I identified the key predicates within the goal. Essentially, I need the rovers to take images of three different objectives, send them to the lander, and then analyze and send back the analysis of a stone and soil sample. 
           
           I broke this down:
           
           1.  **Image Taking & Sending:** I noticed that both rovers are already in their starting configurations and that the problem restricts them to fixed positions, so I don't need to move them. It's all about coordinating the camera and communication, and the camera mode. I decided to use rover `v12` to take all the images, and that requires calibrating the camera and then sending the image. I have image visibility and communication visibility facts available. 
           2.  **Analysis & Sending:** For analysis, I can send an analysis of rock type `v2` (like `v4`) and soil type `v6` (like `v7`). I'll have rover `v12` sample the rock sample, then I'll use `v12` to sample `v4`, send the analysis, and then drop it from the store to ensure it's free. After that, I'll have `v14` sample `v7`, send the analysis, and drop it.
           3.  **Critical Assumption:** The main assumption is that the continuous parameters (like `imagevisible` and `comvisible` configurations, which are `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`) are compatible with the rovers' fixed locations (`v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14`) since the only `move` actions do nothing (the rovers can't move).
           
           **Here's the detailed plan:**
           
           **Image Sequence with `v12`:**
           
           1.  **For objective `v18`:** Calibrate, then take image, then send.
           2.  **For objective `v17`:** Calibrate, then take image, then send.
           3.  **For objective `v19`:** Calibrate, then take image, then send.
           
           **Analysis & Send:**
           
           1.  **Rover `v12`:** Sample `v4` (rock), then send analysis, then `drop_rock`.
           2.  **Rover `v14`:** Sample `v7` (soil), then send analysis, then `drop_rock`.
           
           This strategy uses the given information and allowed actions to achieve the specified goal state. The order of image-taking and analysis doesn't matter, as they use different resources.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10), (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11), (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11), (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10), (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11), (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11), (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v19 v10), (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v19 v10 v11), (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v19 v11), (sample_rock v12 #o5 v4 v16), (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v4), (sample_rock v14 #o5 v7 v16), (send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v7)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Rethinking the Strategy with a Severely Limited Action Set**
           
           Okay, so the previous plan failed because it relied on actions that are no longer permitted. Now I've been given a very restricted set of actions: basically, pointless "move" commands that do nothing, and the ability to drop rocks from stores. I need to re-evaluate how I can achieve `new-axiom@0()` with these constraints.
           
           First, I examined the goal's conditions against the initial state. I see that `atconf` and `free` conditions for rovers and stores are already satisfied. However, achieving `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates is impossible, as the necessary `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions are unavailable. The current "move" actions won't change anything, so they won't help.
           
           The only remaining option is to use the `drop_rock` actions. But even that's useless in the initial state. Since both stores are initially *free*, I can't even apply the `drop_rock` action in the first step. The preconditions aren't met.
           
           Based on this, it's pretty clear. The goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently *unreachable*. Given the severely limited actions at my disposal, I can't satisfy the critical `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` conditions. I'm essentially stuck.
