(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation for Object ID 4**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The task is to find 50 stable placements for an object (ID 4) on a surface.  The surface is a square, centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27m x 0.27m. The object is also nearly square, with dimensions approximately 0.0835m x 0.0835m.  A stable placement means the object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box), when rotated, must fit within the surface's AABB.
           
           Since the object is almost square, the effective dimensions of its rotated AABB won't change dramatically with rotation.  I can simplify by considering the range of possible rotated dimensions. The minimum extent will be when aligned with axes, and the maximum at 45 degrees.
           
           The surface bounds are: `surf_min_x = -0.135, surf_max_x = 0.135, surf_min_y = -0.135, surf_max_y = 0.135`. The bounds for a stable placement will be derived from there.
           
           My strategy is to generate placements for several key rotation angles (theta) and center coordinates (x, y).
           
           1.  **`theta = 0` (and `2*pi`)**: Here, the object's AABB is aligned with the axes. So the rotation is trivial. The object is `0.0835` wide, and so the center coordinates can be in the range `[-0.093, 0.093]` in x and y. I'll place 25 placements in a grid.
           2.  **`theta = pi/4`**: Here, the object will be rotated 45 degrees. I calculate the new AABB dimensions. The bounds are slightly tighter than `theta=0`. So my placements are `[-0.0759, 0.0759]`. I'll place 9 locations.
           3.  **`theta = pi/2`**: Again the rotation is simple. I can use the values as for `theta = 0`. I'll place 9 locations.
           4.  **`theta = 3*pi/4`**: Since the dimensions of the AABB will be the same as pi/4, I'll reuse those values, but vary the coordinate placements slightly to create additional placements. This gives 7 locations.
           
           These 50 placement combinations should cover the surface reasonably well and ensure stable containment.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Analysis and Strategy**
           
           Okay, so I've received confirmation that the previous object (ID 4) was successfully placed. Its dimensions and location are now fixed, and I need to strategically position object 5 on the same surface without any overlap. The challenge is that both objects are close to square, and I have to ensure stability.
           
           First, I've carefully calculated the bounding box of object 4. This gives me a precise region to avoid.  Since object 5's dimensions are roughly the same, I need to consider its position and rotation carefully. To avoid collisions, I'll analyze the best options.
           
           I can make the placements stable by placing object 5 to the right, to the top, to the bottom, to the left of object 4 or by entirely avoiding the object 4. After doing collision checks, here are all of the placement combinations:

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Object 7 Placement**
           
           Okay, so I've got the successful placements for objects 4 and 5, which I need to treat as fixed obstacles. Now I need to figure out the best spot for this new object, ID 7.
           
           First things first: I need to calculate Object 7's effective size based on its rotation, `theta`. Since it's a square, it simplifies to  `obj7_s_eff(theta) = obj7_sx * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This means the *maximum* effective size will be at 45 degrees (`theta = pi/4`) and the *minimum* size at 0 or 90 degrees.
           
           Next, I need to define the valid *ranges* where I *could* potentially place Object 7 on Surface 0. Surface 0 is basically a square region defined by `[-0.135, 0.135] x [-0.135, 0.135]`. So I need to account for Object 7's effective size to define this range for both `x` and `y`.
           
           The main objective is to *avoid* collision with Object 4 and 5. I calculated the AABBs for Object 4 and 5:
           
           *   Object 4: `[-0.12177, -0.03823] x [-0.12177, -0.03823]`
           *   Object 5: `[-0.12671, -0.03329] x [-0.00671, 0.08671]`
           
           By looking at their `x` and `y` ranges, it's pretty clear that Object 4 and 5 are primarily clustered in the *left half* of the available surface space.
           
           So, I plan to place Object 7 in the *right half* of the surface, or the bottom.
           
           To find valid placements, I am generating 50 possible locations for Object 7 by focusing on the right half, considering the space not occupied by Objects 4 and 5.
           I selected 50 placements by varying `x` and `y`, with different rotation values, and verified the valid placements.
           I'll also keep in mind that I could explore the bottom part of the surface too.
           
           For placements with `theta = 0` and `pi/2`, I am considering `x` values of `0.04` and `0.08`, and `y` values spanning the surface to avoid any overlap, while maintaining the object's `x` placement.
           For placements with `theta = pi/4, pi/6`, I adjusted the values based on their rotation angles.
           For placements in `x > 0`, it is `(0.04, -0.07)`, `(0.04, -0.04)`, `(0.04, 0.0)`, `(0.04, 0.04)`, `(0.04, 0.07)`, etc, for various rotations.
           
           I've made sure that the AABB calculations will *always* put Object 7 to the right of Objects 4 and 5 in the x direction to avoid collision with both.
           The placement ranges I generated were calculated and double-checked for collision-free placements. The plan is to select the set that meets all requirements.

           For placements with `theta = pi/4, pi/6`, I adjusted the values based on their rotation angles.
           For placements in `x > 0`, it is `(0.04, -0.07)`, `(0.04, -0.04)`, `(0.04, 0.0)`, `(0.04, 0.04)`, `(0.04, 0.07)`, etc, for various rotations.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **My Primary Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           I'm tasked with placing 50 stable instances of object 6 onto surface 0, avoiding collisions with the existing objects 4, 5, and 7 while staying within the surface bounds. Given the object's square shape (0.09687 units on each side), I must account for its size and potential rotations. My approach is to consider both surface containment and collision avoidance in a systematic way.
           
           To remain on the surface, I first establish valid center ranges for the new object's placement. For 0-degree or 90-degree rotation, the center's x and y coordinates need to fall within a range of [-0.08656, 0.08656]. For 45-degree and 135-degree rotation, the range is [-0.0665, 0.0665].
           
           Next, I need to prevent any collisions. I will determine "safe" zones for object 6 by analyzing the occupied regions of objects 4, 5, and 7. After visualizing the object extents, I can calculate the combined bounding box of existing objects, which is approximately [-0.1267, 0.0799] x [-0.1218, 0.0867].
           
           Considering the size of the objects, rotations and the surface bounds, I must identify regions that provide enough space. I will look for empty spaces within the surface. I also aim to place new objects far away from the existing objects, specifically on the top right quadrant (positive x and positive y values).
           
           A crucial area to check will be the right edge of the surface. This is because most of the current obstacles are on the left side of surface. Since I need to place objects in a strategic region with a variety of angles and spatial arrangements, I'll identify a number of coordinates.
           I will place the object in the positive range of coordinates to minimize conflict.
           
           Based on the shape of the surface and the other objects, it might be possible to place it entirely *above* or to the *right* of all existing objects. This would provide the greatest chance for stable placements. I will select a suitable subset that allows 50 placements. I will choose x and y coordinates that provide a reasonable spread within the valid regions. I will also make sure the placement does not exceed surface dimensions.
           After going through the process, the coordinates chosen are:
           
           **25 Placements for rotation 0 degrees:**
           `x_coords = [0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06]`
           `y_coords = [0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06]`
           
           **25 Placements for rotation pi/2 degrees:**
           `x_coords = [0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06]`
           `y_coords = [0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06]`
