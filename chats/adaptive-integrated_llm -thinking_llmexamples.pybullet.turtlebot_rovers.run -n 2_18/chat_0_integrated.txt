           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v7 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.897, 0.61), (1.034, 0.747)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571)).

           Object v15 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           Object v9 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **A Strategic Breakdown for Achieving the Goal**
           
           Alright, let's dissect this. My primary objective is `new-axiom@0()`, which I know translates into ensuring that images of two objectives are received, and that analyses are received for a set of rocks. The initial state is a given, so let's use what we know.
           
           The first few conditions in the goal statement are already true. No action needed! It looks like there are two rovers, two objects to take pictures of, and a set of rocks to sample.
           
           My starting point is the readily available knowledge in the initial state. I’ve identified a few key actors: rovers, cameras, modes, stores, and objectives.
           
           *   **Objectives:** I've noted down the objects `v17` and `v18`.
           *   **Rocks:** Rocks of type 'stone' (`v2`) are `v1`, `v3`, `v4` and those of type 'soil' (`v6`) are `v8`, `v5`, `v7`.
           
           The challenge lies in getting the images and analyses. I know I have the building blocks: actions like `send_image`, `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_analysis`, and `sample_rock`. The puzzle is to fit them together.
           I've determined that `send_image` and `send_analysis` are the most critical actions, as they achieve the *primary* goal.
           
           **Image Acquisition:**
           
           I need to take images of both objectives (`v17`, `v18`) and send them. It appears that rover `v12` is the ideal choice for this, because it has lines-of-sight and communication capabilities at its initial configuration, `v13`.
           
           **Step 1:** To take and send an image of `v17`, I need `calibrate` the camera `v10` on rover `v12` (at configuration `v13`) to focus on the objective `v17`. Then, I must capture the image with `take_image` using mode `v11`, and finally, send it using `send_image`.
           
           The same steps are then repeated for `v18`.
           
           **Rock Analysis:**
           
           Now for the rock analyses. I will have to ensure that all the rocks receive their appropriate analysis to their respective types. I have to use both rovers and their store to accomplish this. Rover `v12` can sample rocks `v1`, `v3` and `v4` and `v14` can sample `v5, v7, v8`.
           
           **Step 2:** Sample `v1` with rover `v12`, `send_analysis`, then `drop_rock`. This frees up the store for the next analysis.
           
           I will repeat this `sample`, `send`, `drop` procedure for the three soil rocks using rover `v14`. I'm going to take this sequence for each.
           
           **Important Note:** I must assume that all the continuous parameters like #o0, #o3, #o5 correlate to the current configuration of the appropriate rover as my plan will fail if I deviate from the initial setup.
           
           After careful consideration of the problem constraints, I have the following plan.
           *   Calibrate `v10` on rover `v12` for `v17` (at `v13`). Then send and take an image.
           *   Repeat for `v18`.
           *   Sample rocks:
               *   `v12`: sample, send, drop, then repeat for remaining rocks.
               *   `v14`: sample, send, drop then repeat for the other rocks.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Problem: An Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been presented with a very constrained set of actions – basically just moving and dropping rocks. The user's input highlighted that any other actions I might've tried are invalid. That's a huge restriction.
           
           Looking at the goal, `new-axiom@0()`, I see it's composed of several sub-goals: maintaining two configurations (`atconf`), ensuring two locations are free (`free`), and establishing several image and analysis receipts.
           
           My initial thought was to consider the `move` actions as maintaining configurations and then to focus on dropping rocks to make locations free. But then I realized that the `free` predicates are already true in the initial state. This meant the available `drop_rock` actions wouldn't *do* anything useful.
           
           The bigger problem is the image and analysis receipts. I immediately recognized that I'd need actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`, and `calibrate` to reach those parts of the goal. But none of those actions are even *valid* in this problem.
           
           Therefore, because I can't achieve several key components of the goal with the given valid actions, I must conclude the goal is simply unreachable.
