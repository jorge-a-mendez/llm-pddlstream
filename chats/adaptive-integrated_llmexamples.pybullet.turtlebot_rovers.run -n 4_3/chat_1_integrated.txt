           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires that at least four objectives have received images, at least two types of rocks have received analysis, and both rovers have a free storage slot and are at some configuration. Looking at the initial state, rover v12 and v14 both have free storage v16 and are at specific configurations (v13 and v15 respectively). So we need to satisfy the image and analysis conditions.
           
           For the images, we have four objectives: v17, v18, v19, v20. Both rovers (v12 and v14) can take images of all of these objectives, as well as send them to the lander v9. Since only one camera (v10) is onboard both rovers and it supports mode v11, we will need to calibrate it for each image taking operation.
           
           For rock analysis, we have several rocks of type `v2` (v1, v3, v4) and type `v6` (v5, v7, v8). The goal requires `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, which map to type `v2` and `v6` respectively. We need to sample and send analysis for at least one rock of type v2 and at least one rock of type v6. Both rovers can sample all these rocks, but only when above them. The initial state indicates that both rovers are `above` all of them at configuration `#o5`.
           
           Let's prioritize using rover v14 because its current configuration v15 seems closer to some of the targets (e.g., v5).
           
           The plan will involve:
           1. Calibrating the camera.
           2. Taking images of four objectives.
           3. Sending those images.
           4. Sampling a rock of type v2.
           5. Sampling a rock of type v6.
           6. Sending the analysis for both sampled rocks.
           
           We will use rover `v14` for all operations.

           Configuration #o5 =  -1.0) for rover v14 at target v1 is not in the correct format. Please provided configurations in the format `(<x> <y>)`.
           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires that at least four objectives have received images, at least two types of rocks have received analysis, and both rovers have a free storage slot and are at some configuration. Looking at the initial state, rover v12 and v14 both have free storage v16 and are at specific configurations (v13 and v15 respectively). So we need to satisfy the image and analysis conditions.
           
           For the images, we have four objectives: v17, v18, v19, v20. Both rovers (v12 and v14) can take images of all of these objectives, as well as send them to the lander v9. Since only one camera (v10) is onboard both rovers and it supports mode v11, we will need to calibrate it for each image taking operation.
           
           For rock analysis, we have several rocks of type `v2` (v1, v3, v4) and type `v6` (v5, v7, v8). The goal requires `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, which map to type `v2` and `v6` respectively. We need to sample and send analysis for at least one rock of type v2 and at least one rock of type v6. Both rovers can sample all these rocks, but only when above them. The initial state indicates that both rovers are `above` all of them at configuration `#o5`.
           
           Let's prioritize using rover v14 because its current configuration v15 seems closer to some of the targets (e.g., v5).
           
           The plan will involve:
           1. Calibrating the camera.
           2. Taking images of four objectives.
           3. Sending those images.
           4. Moving to the sample configuration.
           5. Sampling a rock of type v2.
           6. Sending the analysis for the sampled rock of type v2.
           7. Dropping the sampled rock.
           8. Sampling a rock of type v6.
           9. Sending the analysis for the sampled rock of type v6.
           
           We will use rover `v14` for all operations.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires that at least four objectives have received images, at least two types of rocks have received analysis, and both rovers have a free storage slot and are at some configuration. Looking at the initial state, rover v12 and v14 both have free storage v16 and are at specific configurations (v13 and v15 respectively). So we need to satisfy the image and analysis conditions.
           
           For the images, we have four objectives: v17, v18, v19, v20. Both rovers (v12 and v14) can take images of all of these objectives, as well as send them to the lander v9. Since only one camera (v10) is onboard both rovers and it supports mode v11, we will need to calibrate it for each image taking operation.
           
           For rock analysis, we have several rocks of type `v2` (v1, v3, v4) and type `v6` (v5, v7, v8). The goal requires `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, which map to type `v2` and `v6` respectively. We need to sample and send analysis for at least one rock of type v2 and at least one rock of type v6. Both rovers can sample all these rocks, but only when above them. The initial state indicates that both rovers are `above` all of them at configuration `#o5`.
           
           Let's use rover v14 for all operations. We need to find valid configurations for `#o0`, `#o3` and `#o5`.
           
           For `#o0` (comvisible with lander v9 from rover v14): v9 has an AABB of ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). A position around (-2.0, -2.0) should be reachable and visible.
           For `#o3` (imagevisible with objective v17 from rover v14): v17 has an AABB of ((-0.548, 2.138), (-0.465, 2.221)). A position around (-0.5, 2.0) for the rover should work.
           For `#o5` (above rock v1 from rover v14): v1 has an AABB of ((1.369, -0.749), (1.475, -0.643)). A position around (1.4, -0.7) for the rover to be above. We also need to consider other rocks like v5 ((1.593, -1.565), (1.719, -1.44)) which is of type v6. A position like (1.5, -1.0) could be above both.
           
           Let's adjust the `move` actions to ensure the rover is in the correct configuration before `send_image` and `sample_rock`. The current `atconf` for `v14` is `v15`.

           For `#o3` (imagevisible with objective v17 from rover v14): v17 has an AABB of ((-0.548, 2.138), (-0.465, 2.221)). A position around (-0.5, 1.5) for the rover might work, avoiding collision with v22 ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)).
           For `#o5` (above rock v1 from rover v14): v1 has an AABB of ((1.369, -0.749), (1.475, -0.643)). A position around (1.4, -0.7) for the rover was unreachable. Let's try (1.0, -1.0) which is still within reasonable distance to be "above". If that's not reachable, we'll try a different `above` configuration provided in the initial state. Since we have multiple `above` facts with `#o5`, the continuous value for `#o5` needs to allow the rover to be above `v1` and `v5`. Let's assume there is a general `#o5` that makes it "above" these rocks.

           For `#o0` (comvisible with lander v9 from rover v14): v9 has an AABB of ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). There's an obstacle v23: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1)). This means the rover cannot be at x=0.0. Let's try x = -0.5 and y = -2.0.
           For `#o3` (imagevisible with objective v17 from rover v14): v17 has an AABB of ((-0.548, 2.138), (-0.465, 2.221)). Obstacle v22: AABB(lower=(-0.75, 1.75, 0.0), upper=(-0.25, 2.25, 0.1)). This means we need to avoid the region around (-0.5, 2.0). Let's try (0.0, 1.70).
           For `#o5` (above rock v1 from rover v14): v1 has an AABB of ((1.369, -0.749), (1.475, -0.643)). Rock v5: ((1.593, -1.565), (1.719, -1.44)). A position around (1.0, -0.7) might be reachable and above the rock.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires that at least four objectives have received images, at least two types of rocks have received analysis, and both rovers have a free storage slot and are at some configuration. Looking at the initial state, rover v12 and v14 both have free storage v16 and are at specific configurations (v13 and v15 respectively). So we need to satisfy the image and analysis conditions.
           
           For the images, we have four objectives: v17, v18, v19, v20. Both rovers (v12 and v14) can take images of all of these objectives, as well as send them to the lander v9. Since only one camera (v10) is onboard both rovers and it supports mode v11, we will need to calibrate it for each image taking operation.
           
           For rock analysis, we have several rocks of type `v2` (v1, v3, v4) and type `v6` (v5, v7, v8). The goal requires `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, which map to type `v2` and `v6` respectively. We need to sample and send analysis for at least one rock of type v2 and at least one rock of type v6. Both rovers can sample all these rocks, but only when above them. The initial state indicates that both rovers are `above` all of them at configuration `#o5`.
           
           Let's try to use rover v14 for all operations. We need to find valid configurations for `#o0`, `#o3` and `#o5`.
           
           For `#o0` (comvisible with lander v9 from rover v14): v9 has an AABB of ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). Obstacle v23 at x=0.0. Let's try to find a position to the right of the lander and to the left of v23. Try (-1.0, -1.0). The initial `atconf` for `v14` is `v15` which is `(-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)`. This position is close to the lander. Let's try this.
           For `#o3` (imagevisible with objective v17 from rover v14): v17 has an AABB of ((-0.548, 2.138), (-0.465, 2.221)). Obstacle v22: AABB(lower=(-0.75, 1.75, 0.0), upper=(-0.25, 2.25, 0.1)). Obstacle v23 at x=0.0. Let's try to move outside these obstacles. Try (-1.0, 1.75).
           For `#o5` (above rock v1 from rover v14): v1 has an AABB of ((1.369, -0.749), (1.475, -0.643)). Rock v5: ((1.593, -1.565), (1.719, -1.44)). Obstacle v24: AABB(lower=(0.763, -0.626), upper=(0.897, -0.491)). Let's try (1.5, -1.0), which is close to v5.

           Let's continue to use rover v14 for all operations, as it is currently at v15 which is `(-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)`. We need to find valid configurations for `#o0`, `#o3` and `#o5` that are reachable from v15, collision-free, and occlusion-free.
           
           For `#o0` (comvisible with lander v9 from rover v14): v9 has an AABB of ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). The rover is currently at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. This is very close to the lander. Let's try to stay at `v15` as the communication configuration, if `comvisible` allows this. The initial state has `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `conf(v14, #o0)`, but also `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o0)`. This implies that `v15` might not be `#o0` directly, but a motion to `#o0` from `v15` is allowed. Let's try `(-1.5, -2.0)`.
           For `#o3` (imagevisible with objective v17 from rover v14): v17 has an AABB of ((-0.548, 2.138), (-0.465, 2.221)). Obstacle v22: AABB(lower=(-0.75, 1.75, 0.0), upper=(-0.25, 2.25, 0.1)). Obstacle v23 at x=0.0. Let's try to position the rover where it has clear line of sight to v17. A good candidate could be around `(-1.5, 1.5)`.

           Let's continue to use rover v14 for all operations, as it is currently at v15 which is `(-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)`. We need to find valid configurations for `#o0`, `#o3` and `#o5` that are reachable from v15, collision-free, and occlusion-free.
           
           For `#o0` (comvisible with lander v9 from rover v14): v9 has an AABB of ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). The rover's current location `v15` is `(-1.0, -1.75)`. Let's try to get `comvisible` from `v15` itself. `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `conf(v14, #o0)` are given. This means we are free to set `#o0` to `v15` for simplicity IF that location provides a good ray to v9. If not, we will try to find a configuration reachable from `v15` that is not in collision with v9 and can see it. Let's try `(-1.0, -1.0)` for `#o0`, as it's near `v15` and potentially allows communication. This was previously found as not reachable. Let's try `(-0.5, -1.5)`.
           For `#o3` (imagevisible with objective v17 from rover v14): v17 has an AABB of ((-0.548, 2.138), (-0.465, 2.221)). Obstacle v22: AABB(lower=(-0.75, 1.75, 0.0), upper=(-0.25, 2.25, 0.1)). Obstacle v23 at x=0.0. Let's try `(-0.25, 1.5)`. This avoids both obstacles and provides visibility.
           For `#o5` (above rock v1 from rover v14): v1 has an AABB of ((1.369, -0.749), (1.475, -0.643)). Rock v5: ((1.593, -1.565), (1.719, -1.44)).

           Let's use rover v14 for all operations. It's currently at `v15` which is `(-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)`. We need to find valid configurations for `#o0`, `#o3` and `#o5` that are reachable from `v15`, collision-free, and occlusion-free.
           
           For `#o0` (comvisible with lander v9 from rover v14): v9 has an AABB of ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). `v15` is `(-1.0, -1.75)`. This is very close to the lander. The `comvisible` predicate only needs a ray to the lander, not that the rover is inside the lander's AABB. Let's try `(-1.0, -1.75)` which is `v15`, meaning no `move` for communication is required. The provided action instances include `(send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11)` which has `#o0` as a configuration. Also, the initial state includes `conf(v14, #o0)` which means `#o0` is a configuration of `v14`. Let's assume that `#o0` can be set to `v15`.
           For `#o3` (imagevisible with objective v17 from rover v14): v17 has an AABB of ((-0.548, 2.138), (-0.465, 2.221)). Obstacle v22: AABB(lower=(-0.75, 1.75, 0.0), upper=(-0.25, 2.25, 0.1)). Obstacle v23 at x=0.0. Let's try `(-0.9, 1.0)`. This is outside the obstacle range.
           For `#o5` (above rock v1 from rover v14): v1 has an AABB of ((1.369, -0.749), (1.475, -0.643)). Rock v5: ((1.593, -1.565), (1.719, -1.44)). Obstacle v24: AABB(lower=(0.763, -0.626), upper=(0.897, -0.491)). Let's try `(1.0, -0.5)`. This should be above v1 and still reachable and avoid v24.
           
           If `#o0` is set to `v15`, then we do not need to move to `#o0` before sending images, we just need to be at `v15`. Then, `move v14 #o3 #o2 #o0` would mean moving from `#o3` to `v15`.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires that at least four objectives have received images, at least two types of rocks have received analysis, and both rovers have a free storage slot and are at some configuration. Looking at the initial state, rover v12 and v14 both have free storage v16 and are at specific configurations (v13 and v15 respectively). So we need to satisfy the image and analysis conditions.
           
           For the images, we have four objectives: v17, v18, v19, v20. Both rovers (v12 and v14) can take images of all of these objectives, as well as send them to the lander v9. Since only one camera (v10) is onboard both rovers and it supports mode v11, we will need to calibrate it for each image taking operation.
           
           For rock analysis, we have several rocks of type `v2` (v1, v3, v4) and type `v6` (v5, v7, v8). The goal requires `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, which map to type `v2` and `v6` respectively. We need to sample and send analysis for at least one rock of type v2 and at least one rock of type v6. Both rovers can sample all these rocks, but only when above them. The initial state indicates that both rovers are `above` all of them at configuration `#o5`.
           
           Let's use rover v14 for all operations. It's currently at `v15` which is `(-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)`. We need to find valid configurations for `#o0`, `#o3` and `#o5` that are reachable from `v15`, collision-free, and occlusion-free.
           
           For `#o0` (comvisible with lander v9 from rover v14): v9 has an AABB of ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). `v15` is `(-1.0, -1.75)`. This is the initial position of `v14`. Let's assume that `v15` itself satisfies `comvisible` to `v9` since it's directly from the initial state that `conf(v14, #o0)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` exist. The "not reachable" error for `(-1.0, -1.75)` as `#o0` might imply that the `motion` predicate has to be used to reach `#o0` and `v15` is not `#o0`. Let's re-evaluate. If `v15` is not directly `#o0`, then we need a *different* continuous value for `#o0`. Let's try `(-2.0, -1.0)` for `#o0`, assuming a larger move is allowed and it's free.
           For `#o3` (imagevisible with objective v17 from rover v14): v17 has an AABB of ((-0.548, 2.138), (-0.465, 2.221)). Obstacle v22: AABB(lower=(-0.75, 1.75, 0.0), upper=(-0.25, 2.25, 0.1)). Obstacle v23 at x=0.0. Let's try `(-1.5, 1.0)`. This should be outside the obstacles.
           For `#o5` (above rock v1 from rover v14): v1 has an AABB of ((1.369, -0.749), (1.475, -0.643)). Rock v5: ((1.593, -1.565), (1.719, -1.44)). Obstacle v24: AABB(lower=(0.763, -0.626), upper=(0.897, -0.491)). Let's try `(1.8, -1.0)`. This should be above `v5` and avoid `v24`.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires that at least four objectives have received images, at least two types of rocks have received analysis, and both rovers have a free storage slot and are at some configuration. Looking at the initial state, rover v12 and v14 both have free storage v16 and are at specific configurations (v13 and v15 respectively). So we need to satisfy the image and analysis conditions.
           
           For the images, we have four objectives: v17, v18, v19, v20. Both rovers (v12 and v14) can take images of all of these objectives, as well as send them to the lander v9. Since only one camera (v10) is onboard both rovers and it supports mode v11, we will need to calibrate it for each image taking operation.
           
           For rock analysis, we have several rocks of type `v2` (v1, v3, v4) and type `v6` (v5, v7, v8). The goal requires `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, which map to type `v2` and `v6` respectively. We need to sample and send analysis for at least one rock of type v2 and at least one rock of type v6. Both rovers can sample all these rocks, but only when above them. The initial state indicates that both rovers are `above` all of them at configuration `#o5`.
           
           Let's switch to using rover `v12` if `v14` is having trouble finding reachable configurations. Rover `v12` is at `v13` which is `(1.0, -1.75, 3.142)`.
           
           Let's try to find valid configurations for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` for rover `v12` that are reachable from `v13`, collision-free, and occlusion-free.
           
           For `#o0` (comvisible with lander v9 from rover v12): v9 has an AABB of ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). `v13` is `(1.0, -1.75)`. This is quite far from the lander. The max communication range is 4. Let's try `(0.0, -1.0)`.
           For `#o3` (imagevisible with objective v17 from rover v12): v17 has an AABB of ((-0.548, 2.138), (-0.465, 2.221)). Obstacle v22: AABB(lower=(-0.75, 1.75, 0.0), upper=(-0.25, 2.25, 0.1)). Obstacle v23 at x=0.0. Let's try `(0.5, 1.0)`. This should be outside listed obstacles and within image range (2 units).
           For `#o5` (above rock v1 from rover v12): v1 has an AABB of ((1.369, -0.749), (1.475, -0.643)). Rock v5: ((1.593, -1.565), (1.719, -1.44)). Obstacle v24: AABB(lower=(0.763, -0.626), upper=(0.897, -0.491)). Let's try `(1.5, -0.7)`. This is close to the center of v1. It should be reachable from `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)`.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires that at least four objectives have received images, at least two types of rocks have received analysis, and both rovers have a free storage slot and are at some configuration. Looking at the initial state, rover v12 and v14 both have free storage v16 and are at specific configurations (v13 and v15 respectively). So we need to satisfy the image and analysis conditions.
           
           For the images, we have four objectives: v17, v18, v19, v20. Both rovers (v12 and v14) can take images of all of these objectives, as well as send them to the lander v9. Since only one camera (v10) is onboard both rovers and it supports mode v11, we will need to calibrate it for each image taking operation.
           
           For rock analysis, we have several rocks of type `v2` (v1, v3, v4) and type `v6` (v5, v7, v8). The goal requires `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, which map to type `v2` and `v6` respectively. We need to sample and send analysis for at least one rock of type v2 and at least one rock of type v6. Both rovers can sample all these rocks, but only when above them. The initial state indicates that both rovers are `above` all of them at configuration `#o5`.
           
           Let's continue with rover `v12` at `v13` `(1.0, -1.75, 3.142)`. We need to find valid configurations for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` that are reachable from `v13`, collision-free, and occlusion-free.

Configuration #o5 = (1.5 -1.5) for rover v12 at target v1 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires that at least four objectives have received images, at least two types of rocks have received analysis, and both rovers have a free storage slot and are at some configuration. Looking at the initial state, rover v12 and v14 both have free storage v16 and are at specific configurations (v13 and v15 respectively). So we need to satisfy the image and analysis conditions.
           
           For the images, we have four objectives: v17, v18, v19, v20. Both rovers (v12 and v14) can take images of all of these objectives, as well as send them to the lander v9. Since only one camera (v10) is onboard both rovers and it supports mode v11, we will need to calibrate it for each image taking operation.
           
           For rock analysis, we have several rocks of type `v2` (v1, v3, v4) and type `v6` (v5, v7, v8). The goal requires `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, which map to type `v2` and `v6` respectively. We need to sample and send analysis for at least one rock of type v2 and at least one rock of type v6. Both rovers can sample all these rocks, but only when above them. The initial state indicates that both rovers are `above` all of them at configuration `#o5`.
           
           Let's use rover `v12` which is at `v13` `(1.0, -1.75, 3.142)`. We need to find valid configurations for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` that are reachable from `v13`, collision-free, and occlusion-free. The repeated "not reachable" errors suggest a systematic problem with the chosen coordinates or the allowed motion predicates. Let's try to be very close to the objects for `#o3` and `#o5`, and for `#o0`, ensure it's not within the AABB of the lander or obstacles.
           
           For `#o0` (comvisible with lander v9 from rover v12): v9 has an AABB of ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). `v13` is `(1.0, -1.75)`. Let's try a point far from `v13` but within communication range and free space. Maybe `(-0.5, -1.0)`.
           For `#o3` (imagevisible with objective v17 from rover v12): v17 has an AABB of ((-0.548, 2.138), (-0.465, 2.221)). Obstacle v22: AABB(lower=(-0.75, 1.75, 0.0), upper=(-0.25, 2.25, 0.1)). Obstacle v23 at x=0.0. Let's try `(-0.4, 1.7)`. This is very close to v17 but outside v22 and v23.
           For `#o5` (above rock v1 from rover v12): v1 has an AABB of ((1.369, -0.749), (1.475, -0.643)). Rock v5: ((1.593, -1.565), (1.719, -1.44)). Obstacle v24: AABB(lower=(0.763, -0.626), upper=(0.897, -0.491)). Let's try `(1.4, -1.2)`. This is between v1 and v5, and outside v24.

The repeated "not reachable" errors are a significant challenge, indicating either complex geometry or limitations in the motion model. I've tried many permutations of nearby locations.
           
           I will attempt one final set of coordinates, trying to stay as close as possible to the starting configuration and the target objects, while carefully considering the obstacles and reachability.
           
           For `#o0` (comvisible with lander v9 from rover v12): v9 has an AABB of ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). `v13` is `(1.0, -1.75)`. Let's try `(-1.5, -1.7)`. This is very close to the lander and reachable from `v13`.
           For `#o3` (imagevisible with objective v17 from rover v12): v17 has an AABB of ((-0.548, 2.138), (-0.465, 2.221)). Obstacle v22: AABB(lower=(-0.75, 1.75, 0.0), upper=(-0.25, 2.25, 0.1)). Let's try `(-0.6, 1.5)`. This is outside `v22` and close to `v17`.
           For `#o5` (above rock v1 from rover v12): v1 has an AABB of ((1.369, -0.749), (1.475, -0.643)). Rock v5: ((1.593, -1.565), (1.719, -1.44)). Let's try `(1.2, -1.0)`. This should be above `v1` and `v5` and reachable from `v13`.
           
           If these coordinates still fail due to reachability, it is highly likely that the provided problem instance is unsolvable given the combination of scene geometry and restricted motion. I have exhausted plausible coordinate choices that are clearly outside of reported collision zones and within reasonable proximity for reachability.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires that at least four objectives have received images, at least two types of rocks have received analysis, and both rovers have a free storage slot and are at some configuration. Looking at the initial state, rover v12 and v14 both have free storage v16 and are at specific configurations (v13 and v15 respectively). So we need to satisfy the image and analysis conditions.
           
           For the images, we have four objectives: v17, v18, v19, v20. Both rovers (v12 and v14) can take images of all of these objectives, as well as send them to the lander v9. Since only one camera (v10) is onboard both rovers and it supports mode v11, we will need to calibrate it for each image taking operation.
           
           For rock analysis, we have several rocks of type `v2` (v1, v3, v4) and type `v6` (v5, v7, v8). The goal requires `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, which map to type `v2` and `v6` respectively. We need to sample and send analysis for at least one rock of type v2 and at least one rock of type v6. Both rovers can sample all these rocks, but only when above them. The initial state indicates that both rovers are `above` all of them at configuration `#o5`.
           
           It appears that finding reachable, collision-free, and occlusion-free configurations for any of the hash-marked parameters is proving to be extremely difficult given the provided scene, obstacle locations, and reachability constraints. I have tried many combinations of coordinates within plausible ranges, attempting to avoid all specified obstacles and maintain line-of-sight/proximity. The continuous nature of the task makes it challenging to pinpoint exact coordinates without a visual aid or more sophisticated collision/reachability checking that I can perform.
           
           Given the repeated failures to find such configurations, it's highly probable that the goal, as described, is *not achievable* from the initial state within the given geometric and kinematic constraints. The "not reachable for robot base" error specifically indicates that the robot cannot physically move to that x,y coordinate from its current position, or "in collision" means it overlaps with an obstacle at that location. The occlusion error means line-of-sight is blocked. These are fundamental issues that prevent the necessary actions from being taken.
           
           Therefore, I cannot provide a plan that satisfies all the conditions.
