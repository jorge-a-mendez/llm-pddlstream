User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm dealing with. I need to generate 25 (x, y) coordinates for robot base positions. The tricky part is ensuring they are all within 4 units of a given target point, avoid collisions with some predefined obstacles, and maintain a clear line of sight to the target. I'll be receiving feedback on the validity of my proposed positions (collision-free and line of sight), but for now, I need to come up with a valid set for the first request.  I'll start by diving into the world of collision detection and line-of-sight analysis.
           
           **Obstacle Analysis and Defining the Playable Space**
           
           First, I need to thoroughly understand these static obstacles. They're presented as AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes). The first AABB I see, ((-2.5, -2.5), (2.5, 2.5)), seems to define the overall space but also functions as an obstacle. The next four AABBs define the boundaries of the space, so I'm thinking the robot needs to be *inside* this map space. Since I have these boundaries as obstacles, the effective navigable space is not the boundary but the space *inside* the outer walls. The boundaries are obstacles, the robot must be *within* them and *not* overlap. The other obstacles are more standard AABBs that I have to work around.
           
           **Collision Detection Logic**
           
           Since I'm dealing with point robots, the AABB collision check is straightforward: a point collides if it's within the box's (x, y) bounds. I've designed an `is_collision_with_aabb()` function to make this efficient. The most prominent obstacle is a vertical wall at x=0. This wall is the main blocker for line of sight and has to be dealt with for any x value in the given range.
           
           **Scene-Specific Constraints: Target (1.88, 0.0)**
           
           I'm given a specific target point: (1.88, 0.0).  This position is important because it changes where the valid robot positions can be. Because the target is to the right of the vertical wall (x=0), the robot *must* also be on the right side of the wall.
           
           **Position Generation Strategy**
           
           I'm aiming for a mix of approaches to achieve 25 distinct positions. I'm going to start with a radial sampling strategy to get diverse positions around the target. This ensures I get various distances and angles. If that's not enough, I'll fall back on a fine-grained grid to fill in the gaps. This ensures robust coverage of the feasible space.  To handle the fact that I want the robots to stay on the right side, I've restricted my X values in the grid to only that side of the map (greater than 0.05).
           
           **Collision and Line-of-Sight Filtering**
           
           For each candidate position, I'm going to run it through a series of checks. First, I check whether the robot's coordinates are in range of the given target (4 units max distance) and are in the scene's given bounding box. Next, I perform collision checks against all the fixed obstacles in the map. After, I implement the line-of-sight rule where if the robot is on the wrong side of the x=0 wall, it is an invalid position. If a potential position passes all these checks, it's considered valid.
           
           **Final Refinement and Output**
           
           I will generate the 25 distinct (x, y) robot positions.  I'll ensure there's a good mix of positions based on the logic described above. Then, I'll output the results in the requested format - no extra formatting, just the list of coordinates.
