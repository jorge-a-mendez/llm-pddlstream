User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with walls at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5. There's a central vertical wall at x = 0. There are also several smaller rectangular obstacles scattered throughout the room, including some near the corners and along the walls. My strategy is to try to place the robot in open areas, avoiding the known obstacles and the central wall. I'll prioritize positions that offer a clear line of sight to the target. For the given target point {target_point}, I'll try to place the robot within a circle of radius 2 centered at the target.
           
           Positions:
           ({target_point.x - 1.5} {target_point.y})
           ({target_point.x + 1.5} {target_point.y})
           ({target_point.x} {target_point.y - 1.5})
