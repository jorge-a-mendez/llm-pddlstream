           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.046, -0.371), (0.047, -0.279)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.09, -0.462), (0.169, -0.383)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.0, -0.325, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.211, 0.977).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.174, 0.275), (-0.075, 0.374)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.13, -0.422, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.655, 0.755).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.125, 0.325, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.922, 0.388).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes three objects: v8, v12, and v14, which are currently on surface v11. The goal is to place all three objects on surface v16. This requires picking up each object from its current pose and placing it on a new pose on v16. The robot arm v4 is initially at configuration v5, and the base is at v3. The poses #o2 are placeholders for the new poses on v16 for each object.
           
           Since all objects must be placed on `v16`, a common strategy is to pick up each object, move the arm/base to the target location if needed, and place the object. The initial state shows `atbconf(v3)`, and the `basemotion` actions allow moving between `v3` and `#o3` (which is itself a base configuration). It's most efficient to avoid unnecessary base movements. All the `pick` and `place` actions are available with `kin` relations that involve `#o3` for the base configuration. This implies that the robot may need to move its base to `#o3` to perform these actions, or `#o3` could be the same as `v3`. For now, we will assume it might be necessary to move the base. However, the provided `basemotion` actions show that `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)` and `basemotion(#o3, #o0, #o3)` and `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)` and `basemotion(#o3, #o0, v3)` are available, which allow the robot to move from v3 to v3 (no movement), v3 to #o3, and #o3 to v3. The plan will be to pick each item from its current pose and place it at a new pose on v16. We need to assign specific collision-free poses on v16 for each object.
           
           Plan:
           1. Move base to a configuration suitable for picking and placing (if #o3 is different from v3 and better). If not, stay at v3. Given the available kin relations, we need to achieve `atbconf(#o3)`. We can achieve this by `move_base(v3, #o3, #o0)`.
           2. Pick v8 from v9.
           3. Place v8 on #o2 (on v16).
           4. Pick v12 from v13.
           5. Place v12 on #o2 (on v16).
           6. Pick v14 from v15.
           7. Place v14 on #o2 (on v16).
           
           Since #o2 is used for three different objects, we need to provide a different coordinate for each.

User:      Pose #o2 = (0.15 0.0 0.82 0.0) for object v12 on surface v16 is not stable, as the 2D AABB of the object (AABB(lower=(0.11500000596046447, -0.035), upper=(0.18500000596046448, 0.035))) is not contained in the 2D AABB of the surface (AABB(lower=(-0.135, -0.135), upper=(0.135, 0.135))).

Make sure your poses are in the format `(<x> <y> <z> <theta>)`.
           Please provide a plan and poses that achieves the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all poses are valid and stable.

Model:     The scene describes three objects: v8, v12, and v14, which are currently on surface v11. The goal is to place all three objects on surface v16. This requires picking up each object from its current pose and placing it on a new pose on v16. The robot arm v4 is initially at configuration v5, and the base is at v3. The poses #o2 are placeholders for the new poses on v16 for each object.
           
           The previous attempt failed because the chosen poses for v12 and v14 on v16 were not stable. The AABB for v16 is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I need to ensure that the objects' AABBs, when placed on v16, are entirely within these bounds. The objects are v8 (AABB `((-0.046, -0.371), (0.047, -0.279))`), v12 (AABB `((-0.174, 0.275), (-0.075, 0.374))`), and v14 (AABB `((0.09, -0.462), (0.169, -0.383))`). Let's calculate the effective AABBs of these objects, assuming their origin is at the center of their geometry.
           
           For v8 (AABB `((-0.046, -0.371), (0.047, -0.279))`):
           - Width: 0.047 - (-0.046) = 0.093
           - Height: -0.279 - (-0.371) = 0.092
           - These are small enough to fit within v16 (max dimension 0.27).
           
           For v12 (AABB `((-0.174, 0.275), (-0.075, 0.374))`):
           - Width: -0.075 - (-0.174) = 0.099
           - Height: 0.374 - 0.275 = 0.099
           - These are small enough to fit within v16.
           
           For v14 (AABB `((0.09, -0.462), (0.169, -0.383))`):
           - Width: 0.169 - 0.09 = 0.079
           - Height: -0.383 - (-0.462) = 0.079
           - These are small enough to fit within v16.
           
           The issue was that I interpreted the provided AABBs as dimensions, rather than the actual coordinates. I need to make sure the pose of the object when placed on v16 is such that its specific AABB coordinate bounds fit within v16's bounds, taking into account the object's original AABB. A simpler approach is to use the center of the object and ensure its extent (half-width, half-height) plus its center coordinates fit within the surface.
           
           Given `v16`'s AABB is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`, the center is (0,0) and the half-dimensions are 0.135.
           Let's define the poses for the objects such that their AABB is within these bounds. The `z` value for placing on `v16` should be the `z` of `v11` (0.781) plus the height of `v16` plus some offset for the object's own height. The objects have different heights and exact models are not given, so a default `0.82` (which was used previously) might be a reasonable estimate for the top of the object. Let's try to place them close to the center of `v16` but offset from each other to avoid collision.
           
           New proposed poses on v16 for:
           - v8: Let's try (0.0, 0.0, 0.82, 0.0). The AABB of v8 is `((-0.046, -0.371), (0.047, -0.279))`. If we place it at (0,0), its effective AABB relative to (0,0) would be roughly centered. Its width is 0.093 and height is 0.092. These are smaller than 0.135 * 2. So if we place it at (0,0), its extent is within v16.
           - v12: Let's try (0.0, 0.05, 0.82, 0.0). Its AABB `((-0.174, 0.275), (-0.075, 0.374))` is for its own coordinate system. The width is 0.099 and height 0.099. If we place it at (0.0, 0.05), it should fit.
           - v14: Let's try (0.0, -0.05, 0.82, 0.0). Its AABB `((0.09, -0.462), (0.169, -0.383))` is for its own coordinate system. The width is 0.079 and height 0.079. If we place it at (0.0, -0.05), it should fit.
           
           All these new poses should ensure that the objects are fully contained within v16's boundaries when considering the object's actual dimensions relative to its placement point.
