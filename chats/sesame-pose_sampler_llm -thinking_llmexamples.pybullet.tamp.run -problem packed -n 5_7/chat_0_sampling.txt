(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for object ID 4, which is a square with specific dimensions, on a square surface (surface 0). I've got this. Here's my thought process:
           
           First, I need to figure out what "stable" means.  For this problem, it means the object stays entirely within the surface bounds.  That involves calculating the *effective* size of the square object after rotation, which is pretty straightforward since it's square.  After some quick trigonometry, I know the effective size changes depending on the rotation angle (theta).
           
           I'll denote the half effective size as `h_eff(theta)`.
           
           Now, the surface is square, centered at the origin, with dimensions (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  This means I need to make sure the object's center point is within the bounds of the surface, taking into account the effective size.
           
           Since I need 50 placements, I need to be strategic. The object is relatively small compared to the surface. It will fit at any orientation. I can generate a 5x5 grid of positions for two different orientations which will give me 50 positions. I will choose two angles: 0 degrees and 45 degrees.
           
           I'll calculate the valid ranges for the x and y coordinates of the object's center for each angle, then generate a grid of positions within those ranges. Let's do a calculation of the x, y ranges for each orientation.
           For angle 0, I can use h_eff = s/2. The valid ranges are [-0.0898, 0.0898].
           For angle pi/4, I can use h_eff = s * sqrt(2) /2. The valid ranges are [-0.0712, 0.0712].
           
           I will use 5x5 grid of positions for two angles (0 and pi/4) will provide 50 placements. No other considerations are necessary for collisions since no objects have been placed. All 50 placements will have surf_idx = 0.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Placing Object ID 5 While Avoiding Collision**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. I've successfully placed Object ID 4, and I've got its position and dimensions. Now, I need to place Object ID 5 on the same surface, but it *cannot* collide with Object ID 4. This is a classic collision avoidance problem!
           
           First, I analyze Object ID 4. I know its center coordinates and rotation (which is 0 degrees in this case). From its dimensions, I calculate its half-extent to determine the extents of its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box). This gives me the exact region Object ID 4 occupies on the surface. Importantly, I determine that Object ID 4 is positioned in the lower-left corner of the surface.
           
           Next, I look at Object ID 5. I know its dimensions. Since it's square, I can use a simplified formula to calculate its "effective half-size" for any given rotation. The goal is to find at least 50 stable placements, which is a good target number for coverage.
           
           Now, for collision avoidance. I plan to use two main rotations: 0 degrees and 45 degrees (pi/4 radians). For each rotation, I'll calculate the valid center coordinates for Object ID 5, ensuring its AABB doesn't overlap with Object ID 4's AABB.
           
           For the 0-degree rotation (theta=0), I'll determine the valid range of x and y coordinates by calculating the effective half-size. Since Object ID 4 is in the lower-left corner, I'll choose to avoid placements in that quadrant, to guarantee I don't intersect the other object. I'll achieve this by generating a grid and, for points on that grid, filtering for values of x and y which are beyond the extent of the collision box. This will give me at least 25 possible placements.
           
           I'll do the same for the 45-degree rotation (theta=pi/4). After I calculate its effective size for that angle, I'll set up a similar grid. I'll filter for locations where either x or y is large enough to avoid the other object. Again, I'll generate a grid and filter locations which overlap. This will also give me at least 25 different choices.
           
           Finally, I'll combine these two sets of placements for a total of at least 50 valid, collision-free placements. My approach ensures I cover a diverse range of positions on the surface while strictly adhering to the no-collision constraint.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for New Object (ID 7)**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 7) on surface 0, avoiding collisions with two existing objects (ID 4 and ID 5) already placed there. I'm focusing on the surface's dimensions, which are a square of side 0.27 centered at (0,0).
           
           First, I need to understand the constraints. Object 4 is in the bottom-left corner of the surface and object 5 is left-middle.  Object 7's size is 0.0738 x 0.0738. A placement is considered *valid* if it’s within the surface bounds and doesn't intersect with either object's AABB.
           
           I will attempt two orientations.  For both, I will use a helper function to quickly determine if any placement collides with the previously placed objects.
           
           For the first orientation (theta = 0), object 7's effective half-extent is 0.0369. This means that the center of object 7 needs to be within a smaller square centered on (0,0). I will check a 10x10 grid of points in this area.
           
           For the second orientation (theta = pi/4), the effective half-extent is 0.0522. This also means, I need to check the surface bounds further inwards. I will again check a 10x10 grid.
           
           I will generate all the valid points in both cases, then append them to a list.  Finally, I will take the first 50 points in the final combined list to achieve the required placement count.

           I'm thinking of testing placements on a grid, but with two orientations: 0 degrees and 45 degrees (pi/4 radians). For each orientation, I need to calculate the effective half-size, which depends on the rotation.
           
           *   **For 0 degrees,** the effective half-size is simply half the object's side length (which is 0.04308). The valid area for placement is around `[-0.0919, 0.0919]` x `[-0.0919, 0.0919]`. I'll generate a 10x10 grid of points in that area.
           *   **For 45 degrees,** the calculation is a bit more involved. The effective half-size is slightly larger (about 0.0609). The valid center range for this rotation is approx `[-0.0740, 0.0740]` x `[-0.0740, 0.0740]`. I'll generate a 8x8 grid of points for this rotation.
           
           For collision detection, I have a handy function that will check for overlap between AABBs. I'll iterate through my candidate grid points for each orientation, check each candidate placement with existing AABBs to be sure that they are non-colliding. I'll store the stable and non-colliding positions until I reach 50 good placements. It's really just a matter of checking all the combinations within the defined ranges. After double-checking the code to make sure the math is correct, I believe this method will effectively provide the required stable and non-colliding positions.

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning for Placing Object ID 6**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 6) on surface 0, avoiding collisions with four existing objects (IDs 4, 5, 7, and 8).  Surface 0 is a square region centered at (0,0) with a side length of 0.27.
           
           My strategy involves two main orientations: `theta = 0` (aligned with the axes) and `theta = pi/4` (rotated 45 degrees). For each orientation, I first determine the valid central region of the surface, ensuring the new object's bounding box doesn't extend beyond the surface boundaries. Then, I'll generate a grid of potential center points within this region and check each point for collisions against the existing object bounding boxes (AABBs).
           
           To check for collisions efficiently, I'll use the AABB approach.  I'll calculate the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the new object's AABB for each candidate placement. A collision occurs if the intervals of the AABBs of the new object and any existing object overlap on both the x and y axes. Overlap is simply `max(obj1_min, obj2_min) < min(obj1_max, obj2_max)`.
           
           For the `theta = 0` orientation, the object's half-extent is roughly 0.04.

Model:     **Summary of my Reasoning for Placing Object ID 6**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 6) on surface 0, avoiding collisions with four existing objects (IDs 4, 5, 7, and 8).  Surface 0 is a square region centered at (0,0) with a side length of 0.27.
           
           My strategy involves two main orientations: `theta = 0` (aligned with the axes) and `theta = pi/4` (rotated 45 degrees). For each orientation, I first determine the valid central region of the surface, ensuring the new object's bounding box doesn't extend beyond the surface boundaries. Then, I'll generate a grid of potential center points within this region and check each point for collisions against the existing object bounding boxes (AABBs).
           
           To check for collisions efficiently, I'll use the AABB approach.  I'll calculate the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the new object's AABB for each candidate placement. A collision occurs if the intervals of the AABBs of the new object and any existing object overlap on both the x and y axes. Overlap is simply `max(obj1_min, obj2_min) < min(obj1_max, obj2_max)`.
           
           For the `theta = 0` orientation, the object's half-extent is roughly 0.04. This means I'll use the bounding box with `x_min = center_x - 0.04`, `x_max = center_x + 0.04`, `y_min = center_y - 0.04`, `y_max = center_y + 0.04`. With `theta = pi/4`, the diagonal extent (and hence the half-extent) is slightly larger, roughly 0.057.  I will generate two grids of points: 10x10 and 8x8.
