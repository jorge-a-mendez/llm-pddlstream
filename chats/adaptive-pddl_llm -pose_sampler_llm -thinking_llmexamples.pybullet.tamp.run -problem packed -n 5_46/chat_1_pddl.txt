           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v12, v20)
               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           My objective is to generate a plan to achieve the goal state: all of the objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` are `on` object `v20`.  To achieve this, the objects must be at a particular pose `#o2` supported by `v20`. However, the initial state currently has them `atpose` in various locations on `v11`. To accomplish this, I must `pick` each object from its initial pose and `place` it at the desired pose `#o2`. I must carefully check the preconditions of these `pick` and `place` operations. I am constrained to use only action instances listed, which is simply `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.
           
           A careful examination of the action, its preconditions, and the constraints of `kin` facts reveals a crucial mismatch. The `kin` facts, which are essential for `pick` and `place` to determine what arm trajectories can be used, all define base configuration `#o3`, which must also be `atbconf(?q)` (in the preconditions of those actions). However, the initial state has the `atbconf(v3)`. The only allowed base motion is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, which leaves the base configuration as `v3`. It is not possible to execute `pick` or `place` actions because all the required arm trajectory predicates have a mismatched base configuration. Given these restrictions, it is evident that the given goal is simply unreachable with the provided actions.
