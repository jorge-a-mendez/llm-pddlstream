           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for a near-square object (object ID 6) on a square surface. The surface is defined by its AABB bounds: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  The object's dimensions are roughly `0.0898 x 0.0898`, making it almost square. A stable placement means the object must be entirely inside the surface's boundaries.
           
           I'm thinking about the standard conditions for containment: the object's center `(x, y)` needs to stay within the surface bounds adjusted by half the object's effective width and height.  Those effective dimensions change when you rotate the object. I'm using the formula `effective_w = obj_w * abs(cos(theta)) + obj_h * abs(sin(theta))` and `effective_h = obj_w * abs(sin(theta)) + obj_h * abs(cos(theta))` to calculate the effective width and height at a given rotation `theta`.
           
           Since the object is practically square, its effective size doesn't change much with rotation. The most conservative approach is to consider the worst-case scenario, which is at a 45-degree angle. In this case, I'll calculate `effective_s_max = obj_s * sqrt(2)`. This provides me with a safe margin to determine the bounds for the object center.
           
           I've determined the surface's dimensions, which are `0.27 x 0.27`, and the object's dimensions `obj_w = 0.08978647722579997` and `obj_h = 0.08978647722579991`. Since the object is quite small relative to the surface (0.09 vs 0.27), there's plenty of space.
           
           My strategy to generate 50 placements is to use a grid-like structure within the safe region. I will utilize two rotations: 0 and pi/2, or 90 degrees. I will generate 25 placements at 0 degrees and 25 at pi/2 degrees. For each rotation I am considering the following grid points: `x = [-0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06]` and `y = [-0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06]`. The bounds I'm using are safe to cover even when considering the rotated object dimension bounds, specifically `(-0.0715, 0.0715)` for `x` and `y`.
           I need to avoid the placement of new objects in the scene in future requests.
           
           By combining the grid strategy and simple rotation, I will easily satisfy the request while ensuring stability.

(Thoughts: **Collision-Free Object Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, so I've got a handle on this. The task is to find 50 collision-free positions for a new object (ID 4) on surface 0, while avoiding a previously placed object (ID 6). The feedback tells me ID 6 is placed at (-0.06, -0.06) with zero rotation, a fact that's critical to the process.
           
           First, I need to define the safe area for object 4. Since the object is almost a square, I use the largest side (0.094) to determine the effective half-dimension when calculating its AABB.  I'm also provided the surface limits, which are from -0.135 to 0.135 in x and y. Because I aim to place all parts of the objects on the surface, I calculate the maximum safe (x,y) coordinates for object 4's center, which I'll call `(x_c, y_c)`.
           
           To avoid collisions with object 6, I calculate where the object should not be. Since I know the placement of object 6's center, I calculate its AABB. Then I need to figure out what areas within the limits of the surface I can place the object 4. I know I have to avoid the area of collision, thus, I define the expanded area of Object 6, for instance, a point could have a value close to 0.03, where the center could not be place. This tells me that the object 4 should be placed at positions (x,y) on the surface, such that both (x, y) should not lie between [-0.0879, 0.0879]. Then I check the point coordinates on the grid points that are far away from object 6.
           
           To meet the 50-placement requirement, I create grid and identify 7x7 grid points within the acceptable range (-0.087, 0.087). These positions will have rotations of 0 and pi/2. I have 24 positions for rotation 0 and 24 position for rotation pi/2, for a total of 48 positions.
           
           To get the other two, I will add an rotation of pi/4, and select two safe (x, y) values that are not overlapping. I confirm these placements do not intersect. The rotations are 0.0, 1.57079632679, and 0.78539816339.
           
           The final strategy is: identify the safe (x,y) points, calculate the safe range, avoid overlapping object 6's region, calculate collision conditions with `theta=0, pi/2`, and then use pi/4 for the remaining positions.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object 5**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. I've been tasked with finding 50 stable placements for object 5 on surface 0, while carefully avoiding collisions with objects 6 and 4. This is a classic constrained optimization problem, and I'll approach it systematically.
           
           First, I need to understand the geometry of the scene.  Surface 0 is a simple rectangle. Object 6 and Object 4 are already placed, and I have their AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) - essentially, rectangular envelopes that enclose them. The goal is to place object 5 at different positions to avoid collisions while keeping it within the surface boundaries. Object 5 is also almost square.
           
           My strategy involves a few key steps:
           
           1.  **Define the search space:** I need to determine the valid region on surface 0 where object 5's center can be placed, ensuring it stays within the surface's bounds and taking into account object 5's maximum "radius" at any rotation. This is based on calculating the maxiumum half-size (diagonal/2).
           2.  **Identify collision-free zones:**  I'll analyze the space occupied by objects 6 and 4. The union of their AABBs will define the regions I need to avoid. In essence, I'll be looking for "gaps" or "safe zones" where object 5 can be placed without overlapping these existing objects.
           3.  **Generate a set of candidate placements:**  I will start with a grid of potential center locations to consider.
           4.  **Filter the placements:**  I will systematically check each potential center location, and only consider the ones where object 5 wouldn't intersect any of the objects already placed.
           5.  **Placement conditions:** I will check for the conditions that ensure collision avoidance.
           6.  **Rotation selection:** I plan to consider two orientations of the object.  I'll start with 0 degrees (0 radians), and another at 90 degrees (pi/2 radians).
           
           Based on these steps, let's now consider the problem:
           
           *   The AABB (X and Y coordinates) of the region to exclude are identified.
           *   Let's check for these constraints at 0.0 radians
           *   I can also see if I get more efficient results with a 1.5707 radian rotation and compare those sets.
           
           With my calculations, the grid locations for both cases are:
           *   (0.04, -0.08), (0.04, -0.06), (0.04, -0.04), (0.04, -0.02), (0.04, 0.0), (0.04, 0.02), (0.04, 0.04), (0.04, 0.06), (0.04, 0.08)
           *   (0.06, -0.08), (0.06, -0.06), (0.06, -0.04), (0.06, -0.02), (0.06, 0.0), (0.06, 0.02), (0.06, 0.04), (0.06, 0.06), (0.06, 0.08)
           *   (0.08, -0.08), (0.08, -0.06), (0.08, -0.04), (0.08, -0.02),
           
           This gives 25 points.
           
           I add the rotation:
           (0.08, 0.0), (0.08, 0.02), (0.08, 0.04), (0.08, 0.06), (0.08, 0.08) (5 points)
           This gives 30.
           
           I now need to apply 25 unique placements for the `theta=0` configuration and then 25 unique placements for the `theta = pi/2`. This will create the required 50.
