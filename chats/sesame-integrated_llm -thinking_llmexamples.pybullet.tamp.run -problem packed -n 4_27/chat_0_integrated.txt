           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's my plan:**
           
           Okay, so I've got this scenario where I need to place four objects—v8, v12, v14, and v16—onto surface v18. Currently, they're sitting in their respective poses supported by v11, and the objective clearly states they need to end up on v18. This means I'll need to use a single target pose, `#o2`, on `v18` for all of them, because that's the only one provided. Since all the objects are starting at different poses, I will pick them individually from each starting position and place them on `v18`. All of the 'pick' and 'place' actions require the robot's base to be at a specific configuration, `#o3`, so I'll need to incorporate a `move_base` action at the start of the sequence. Then, to make sure I don't violate the constraints, I will place all the objects into their appropriate positions.
           
           Here are the specific actions I'm going to take:
           
           1.  I will start by moving the robot base from its initial configuration `v3` to configuration `#o3`.
           2.  Next, I'll pick up object `v8` from its current pose `v9` and place it onto `#o2` on `v18`.
           3.  I'll then pick up object `v12` from pose `v13` and place it onto `#o2` on `v18`.
           4.  Then, I'll pick up `v14` from pose `v15` and place it onto `#o2` on `v18`.
           5.  Finally, I'll grab `v16` from `v17` and place it onto `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           Before making the plan executable, let's verify.
           The preconditions check out. All of the required *kin* relations and initial states are in place.
           
           And since I have to assign the `#o2` as target to all four objects, I must assign unique positions on the surface. Now, `v18` is a square surface of size 0.27m x 0.27m. My idea is to arrange them on a 2x2 grid. I will place each object's center at distinct coordinates, with the same Z-coordinate to ensure that they are on the surface, and without any overlaps or collisions between objects.
           
           The coordinates for the poses will be:
           
           *   For `v8`: (-0.05, 0.05, 0.781, 0)
           *   For `v12`: (0.05, 0.05, 0.781, 0)
           *   For `v14`: (-0.05, -0.05, 0.781, 0)
           *   For `v16`: (0.05, -0.05, 0.781, 0)
           
           That should satisfy the constraints. All the pre and post conditions will be satisfied and I will have a valid solution.
