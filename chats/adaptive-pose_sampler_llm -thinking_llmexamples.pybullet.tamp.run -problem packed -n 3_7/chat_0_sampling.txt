(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning**
           
           I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 4, dimensions 0.0759967451635617 x 0.0759967451635617) on a square surface defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  My focus is on ensuring these placements are entirely *within* the surface boundaries.
           
           Since the object is square, its bounding box (and therefore its collision footprint) *doesn't* change with rotation. This significantly simplifies things. I need to determine valid ranges for the object's center coordinates (x, y) such that the entire object remains within the surface.
           
           I've calculated the valid ranges for x and y.  The surface's edges are at -0.135 and 0.135, and I need to account for the object's half-size (0.03799837258178085) to avoid any part of the object extending beyond the surface. This leads to valid ranges of approximately [-0.097, 0.097] for both x and y.
           
           To generate the 50 placements, I'll take a methodical approach to cover the available area:
           I will use a 7x7 grid of evenly spaced points within the valid x and y ranges to get 49 placements.
           
           For the final (50th) placement, I will place it at the center of surface 0.
           
           Since the object is square, theta isn't critical. I will make a variety of placements, and set `theta` to 0 for most of them. And in one case, use `math.pi/4`.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've successfully placed object ID 4, and its configuration `(0, 0.0, -0.09700162741821915, -0.09700162741821915)` avoids collisions, which is great. Now, I need to place object ID 5, and I need to generate 50 stable, collision-free placements on the available surface.
           
           First, let's establish the scene: there's only one surface, Surface 0, which is a square region: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. Object 5 is also square, with dimensions (0.0855896380048845, 0.0855896380048845). I've already determined the valid placement area for ID 5. Its center coordinates (x, y) must lie within the range `[-0.09220518099755775, 0.09220518099755775]`.
           
           Now, the collision avoidance: I need to ensure ID 5 doesn't collide with the previously placed ID 4, which is located in the bottom-left corner of the surface.  Since I know ID 4's dimensions and placement, I can calculate its bounding box (AABB). ID 4 occupies the bottom-left corner and will act as an "obstacle". My strategy: the square valid region minus the rectangular obstacle should leave me enough free space to put ID 5.
           
           Here's my approach:
           
           1.  **Calculate Valid Placement Range:** Determine the maximum extent of Object 5 along the x and y axes to identify the valid region.
           2.  **Calculate the AABB of Object 4:**  I've already calculated the AABB of object 4. I need this to identify which area is colliding.
           3.  **Generate a Grid:** I'll set up a grid within the valid placement area for Object 5. I calculated the step needed to create a grid. I avoid any points that would overlap the Object 4 AABB. This will give me a base of 40 safe, collision-free placements.
           4.  **Add Rotations:** To increase diversity and ensure good coverage, I will generate some extra points with rotations. I will select the points that are far from the bottom-left and add various rotations to them. This generates 10 more placements.
           
           I am using this logic to calculate the (x, y) coordinates and theta for a set of placement points.
           
           I will populate an array with the generated positions, each of them in the format (0, theta, x, y) to represent surface index, rotation, and (x, y) center coordinates.
           
           This gives a total of 50 placements.
           
           This strategy ensures that I find stable placements for object ID 5 on the surface while avoiding collisions with the existing object ID 4.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Object Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. I've got to place 50 stable instances of `Object ID: 6` on `Surface 0`.  `Surface 0` is that square area, and I've crunched the numbers: `Object 6` is also a square, with a half-extent of roughly `0.047`.
           
           My first step is to figure out where I *can* actually place these objects without them going over the edge of the surface. Easy enough, given the surface size and object's extents, it's a valid interior rectangle.  Now I need to account for previously placed objects.
           
           I've already calculated the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for `Object ID: 4` and two placements of `Object ID: 5`.  I need to use these AABBs to make sure `Object 6` doesn't overlap them.
           
           Here's where it gets interesting: I can't just place objects willy-nilly. I need to figure out the areas on the surface that are off-limits because they will collide. The collision conditions are clear: I'm checking if the potential position of object `6`'s center is too close to one of the prior objects' AABBs (specifically, their minimum or maximum coordinates).
           
           With that in mind, I need to find the regions I must avoid placing the objects. Once I have those, I can then calculate a 7x7 grid of points within the valid space, as well as an additional point at the center of the valid space with a non-zero rotation.
