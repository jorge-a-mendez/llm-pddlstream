(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: A Square Object on an AABB Surface**
           
           My task is to find 50 stable placements for a square object of dimensions (0.07, 0.07) on a rectangular surface. Stability means the object is fully contained within the surface's bounds. The surface's parameters are AABB: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)). I'll represent each placement as (surface_index, rotation, x, y), where the surface index will always be 0, rotation (theta) is in radians, and (x, y) is the object's center.
           
           Since the object is square, its bounding box's half-extents are consistently (0.035, 0.035) regardless of rotation.  This simplifies the problem: I can set theta to 0 for all placements.  To ensure stability, the object's center must lie within the bounds: 4.235 <= x <= 4.765 and -0.565 <= y <= -0.035.
           
           I'll generate a grid of 56 potential positions within these valid ranges, covering the x and y dimensions. The x range has a length of 0.53 and the y range also has a length of 0.53. I'll split the x range in 8 and the y range in 7 using steps that give a total of 56 placements to satisfy the 50 placements desired. Then I'll generate the grid with the 56 placements.
            I will take the first 50 positions to submit as stable positions.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **My plan for Object ID 10's placement:**
           
           Okay, so I have a new object (ID 10) to place, and I know the surface it needs to be on and its size. I also need to consider the previously placed object (ID 5) as an obstacle.  ID 5 was successfully placed at `(0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565)` and is a square object with sides of `0.07`.  This means it occupies the space around `(4.2, -0.6)` to `(4.27, -0.53)`.
           
           ID 10 is also square, with dimensions `0.0987660953201317` by `0.09876609532013197`.  After some quick calculations, I'm approximating the half-extent of the object as `0.04938`.  I need to place this object on surface 0, which has the bounds `min_x = 4.2, max_x = 4.8` and `min_y = -0.6, max_y = 0.0`.
           
           To fit within the surface, ID 10's center `(x, y)` needs to fall within the range `4.24938 <= x <= 4.75062` and `-0.55062 <= y <= -0.04938`.  Now, I need to make sure it doesn't collide with object 5.
           
           If I consider the bounding boxes, the ranges for the center of object 10 that creates a potential collision zone are the same as object 5, and expands it with its own half extents. The center of ID 10, therefore, needs to be outside the rectangle from `4.24938` to `4.31938` along x, and from `-0.55062` to `-0.48062` along y. That's my "no-go" zone.
           
           To be safe, I need to place object 10 to the right or above this "no-go" region.
           So, I will select an x in the range `[4.32, 4.75]` and a y range in `[-0.55, -0.05]`, while staying outside of the boundaries of the no-go zone.
           That should give me enough safe spots. With precise calculation and coordinate generation, I will be able to deliver 50 stable placements.
