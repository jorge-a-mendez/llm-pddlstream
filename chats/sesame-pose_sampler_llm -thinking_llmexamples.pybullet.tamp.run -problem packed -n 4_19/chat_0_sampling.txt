           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Stable Object Placement Strategy**
           
           My objective is to identify 50 stable placements for a rectangular object (ID 5, dimensions approximately 0.099 x 0.099) on a square surface (0.27 x 0.27). The object must be fully contained within the surface, and its stability is affected by rotation.
           
           To ensure stability, I'll calculate the axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) that encloses the rotated object.  The effective AABB dimensions change with the rotation angle (`theta`):
           *   `W = obj_w * abs(cos(theta)) + obj_h * abs(sin(theta))`
           *   `H = obj_w * abs(sin(theta)) + obj_h * abs(cos(theta))`
           
           A stable placement's center must be within a range defined by the surface dimensions and the rotated AABB. Specifically, the object's center must be located such that:
           *   `surf_0_min_x + W/2 <= x <= surf_0_max_x - W/2`
           *   `surf_0_min_y + H/2 <= y <= surf_0_max_y - H/2`
           
           I plan to generate a diverse set of placements by varying the rotation angle (`theta`). I will choose 10 evenly spaced angles from 0 to 2*pi, and for each angle, I calculate the `W` and `H` of the rotated object.
           
           Then, for each angle, I will generate a small set of points, trying to get a good spread, specifically using a 3x3 grid centered in the available rectangle for the coordinates (x,y).
           
           The code then calculates these values, creates distinct and plausible valid points, and stops after creating 50 valid placements.
           
           The assumption of this technique is that the object is of similar shape to the rectangle (in a general context, if it were significantly different, we might have to increase the placement points).

(Thoughts: **My Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking: The user has given feedback that a previous object (ID 5) placement was successful. That tells me this placement (`0, 0.0, -0.08555215373452908, -0.08555215373452906`) is stable and doesn't collide with any *fixed* obstacles. This is crucial information, and I *must* keep track of it to avoid any future conflicts with object 5 when placing *new* objects.
           
           I've received a request for a new object (ID 7). It's a square roughly `0.073 x 0.073`, and I need to find 50 stable placements for it. I'll need to generate these, while simultaneously avoiding collision with the known object 5, which is already fixed on the surface.
           
           To start, I'll define object 5's details. I have the *exact* placement information that the user gave: surface index, rotation, x and y coordinates, and its size. I'll use this data to calculate the *exact* AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of object 5, so I can accurately detect any collisions.  Since the rotation is 0, the AABB is straightforward to calculate.
           
           Surface 0 spans from `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`. I'll also define the AABB for object 7, so I can generate placements that fit it safely. I know the AABB size will depend on the rotation (theta).  The formula to get the AABB size is straight forward.
           
           My strategy involves generating a grid of potential placements, rotating them, and then checking for collisions.  The process will generate 10 angles to start, then use a 5x5 grid (25 points) along x and y, for each angle. The AABB overlap check for any placement with object 5 has a straightforward formula: checking the intersection of their boundaries. If there's an intersection, it's a collision, and that position is discarded. If not, the current placement is added.  I'll use some basic geometry.
           
           So I will use the established formula and algorithms, and proceed with generating placements for the new object. I will need to iterate to generate enough positions with that.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement for Object 4: A Detailed, Iterative Approach**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan for placing this new object, ID 4, on the surface. We've got two successful placements to work around, and the surface constraints. I'm leveraging my understanding of AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) collision detection and geometric principles for this.
           
           First things first, I'm setting up the groundwork. I've calculated the AABBs for the existing objects (Objects 5 and 7) based on their provided positions and sizes.  This gives me a clear picture of the "no-go" zones.  I'm also noting the dimensions of the new object (approximately 0.0985 x 0.0985).
           
           Now, the core strategy:
           
           1.  **Define the Playground:**  I've established the surface boundaries (-0.135 to 0.135 for both X and Y).
           
           2.  **Obstacle Mapping:**  I'm keeping track of the occupied regions by Objects 5 and 7, represented by their respective AABBs.
           
           3.  **Rotation Exploration:**  To find diverse placements, I will iterate through a range of rotations (theta). I'm planning to sample rotations from 0 to 2\*pi (radians) with 10 equal steps.
           
           4.  **AABB for all rotations:** For each rotation, I'll calculate the new object's AABB extents (W and H) after the object has rotated by `theta`.
           
           5.  **Placement Range:** Then, I'll figure out the valid range for the center of object 4, ensuring it stays within the surface bounds considering the object's width (W) and height (H) for a given `theta`.
           
           6.  **Position Grids:** Then, I'll create a grid of potential center positions within that valid range. I am going to make a 6 x 6 grid of points (5 points from the edge of the surface, plus the center `0,0` for when valid).
           
           7.  **Collision Checks:** I'm going to test each potential `(x, y)` center and `theta` combination for collision with the occupied areas, using an efficient AABB collision check.
           
           8.  **Output:** I will collect a list of at least 50 unique valid, non-colliding placements of object 4.
           
           I had to be extremely careful with my calculations, and there were several fine-grained analyses done of exact placement of all objects.
           
           To refine the approach, I'll need these precise numerical values: `obj_w = 0.09845375701864102`, `obj_h = 0.09845375701864101`.  Then, I'll generate the grid points, check collisions using the AABBs of the other objects, and identify the diverse valid placements.  I'm confident I can find a suitable set of placements with this approach, because of the available, unoccupied space, and my careful attention to detail.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 6**
           
           Okay, I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for this new, approximately square object (Object 6, ID 6) on surface 0.  It's a bit of a puzzle because I have to avoid collisions with three existing objects: Object 5, Object 7, and Object 4. I've got their precise dimensions and AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) to work with. The surface itself is a square region: `[-0.135, 0.135]` by `[-0.135, 0.135]`.
           
           My approach is to iterate through several rotations (theta values) and for each one, calculate the object's effective width and height. Since it's nearly square, the rotated bounding box changes with angle: at 0 and 90 degrees, the width is simply the object's side length. At 45 degrees, though, the rotated bounding box is slightly bigger due to the diagonal. I have to precisely calculate these.
           
           For each rotation, I'll figure out the valid range for the object's center point within surface 0, then create a grid of potential center points to check. Using my existing `is_colliding` function, I'll check each position to see if it collides with the pre-existing objects' AABBs. If a position is valid and I haven't found 50 placements yet, I'll add it to the list.
           
           The trickiest part will be making sure the collision detection is accurate, especially for rotations. I've double-checked my formulas and will use 5 samples per dimension in my grid for the placements. I'm focusing on the right side of the surface, where there seems to be more unoccupied space.
