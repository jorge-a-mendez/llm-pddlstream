           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Assessing the Plan for `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is a conjunction of several atomic facts.  The first four facts (`atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, and `free(v14, v16)`) are already true in the initial state, so no problem there.
           
           The tricky parts are the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. I need four `receivedimage` facts and two combined `type` and `receivedanalysis` facts, one for a "stone" and one for "soil."  Based on the types I have, I need to get analysis of `v1, v3, v4` (stones) and `v5, v7, v8` (soils), and four images.
           
           The available actions seem straightforward. To get a `receivedimage`, I'd need to `calibrate`, `take_image`, and `send_image`. For `receivedanalysis`, I'd need to `sample_rock` and then `send_analysis`. However, the *action instances* provided are severely limited, with only `move` and `drop_rock` actions available.
           
           The problem here is a clear mismatch. The `move` actions simply alter location predicates that are already satisfied by the initial state. The `drop_rock` actions require the store to be *full* - the initial state states they are *free*. This means I can't even *execute* these actions correctly. I would need to have actions like take image, or analyze and such.
           
           Given that these *available* actions can't help me establish the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates, and achieving `new-axiom@0()` demands that they all are true, the goal is, unfortunately, unreachable. It's a fundamental conflict between the capabilities of the actions and the requirements of the goal state.
