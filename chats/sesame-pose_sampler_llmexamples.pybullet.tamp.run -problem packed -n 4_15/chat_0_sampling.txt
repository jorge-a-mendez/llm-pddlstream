           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single square surface centered at the origin, with extents from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y directions. The object is also square, with side length approximately 0.09846.
           
           To place the object stably on the surface, its bounding box must be entirely contained within the surface's bounding box. Since the object is square and the surface is square, we can place the object at various positions and orientations. The object's side length (0.09846) is smaller than the surface's side length (0.27), so there's plenty of room.
           
           The center of the object (x, y) can range from `lower_surface_x + object_half_size_x` to `upper_surface_x - object_half_size_x`.
           For a square object of side `s = 0.09846` and a square surface from `-0.135` to `0.135`:
           Half size of object = `s/2 = 0.04923`.
           Valid x range: `-0.135 + 0.04923` to `0.135 - 0.04923` which is `-0.08577` to `0.08577`.
           Valid y range: `-0.08577` to `0.08577`.
           
           Rotations by multiples of pi/2 (0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2) will result in the same effective bounding box for a square object. For other angles, the effective bounding box will be larger, but since the object is small compared to the surface, a large range of angles should still be possible. I will try a variety of angles, including 0, pi/4, pi/2, and pi/3, and various positions within the valid x and y ranges.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene is the same as before, with a single square surface (surface 0) from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           We successfully placed object 4 at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Object 4 has side length 0.09846.
           The new object (ID 6) is also square, with side length approximately 0.07069.
           
           To place object 6, we need to ensure it is stable on the surface and does not collide with object 4, which is currently at the center.
           Object 4's bounding box is roughly `(-0.04923, -0.04923)` to `(0.04923, 0.04923)`.
           Object 6 has a side length `s = 0.07069`, so its half size is `s/2 = 0.035345`.
           
           The valid range for the center of object 6 (if alone) would be:
           x: `-0.135 + 0.035345` to `0.135 - 0.035345`, which is `-0.099655` to `0.099655`.
           y: `-0.099655` to `0.099655`.
           
           Since object 4 is at the center, we need to place object 6 such that its bounding box does not overlap with object 4's bounding box.
           Object 4 occupies the region `[-0.04923, 0.04923] x [-0.04923, 0.04923]`.
           If object 6 is placed at `(x_6, y_6)` with orientation `theta_6`, its bounding box is `[x_6 - s_6/2, x_6 + s_6/2] x [y_6 - s_6/2, y_6 + s_6/2]` for `theta_6 = 0` or `pi/2`.
           For `theta_6 = 0`, the half-size is `0.035345`.
           To avoid collision with object 4, the minimum x or y distance between their centers must be `0.04923 + 0.035345 = 0.084575`.
           So, if `theta_6 = 0`, `|x_6|` must be greater than or equal to `0.084575` or `|y_6|` must be greater than or equal to `0.084575`.
           
           Let's try placing object 6 near the edges of the surface, away from the center.
           For example, a placement like `(0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.0)` would place the center of object 6 at `(0.09, 0.0)`.
           The x-range of object 6 would be `[0.09 - 0.035345, 0.09 + 0.035345]` = `[0.054655, 0.125345]`. This is within `[-0.135, 0.135]`.
           The y-range would be `[-0.035345, 0.035345]`.
           This placement would not collide with object 4's bounding box `[-0.04923, 0.04923] x [-0.04923, 0.04923]`, as the x-range of object 6 starts at `0.054655` which is greater than `0.04923`.
           
           I will generate a diverse set of placements that avoid the central region occupied by object 4. I will use angles like 0, pi/4, pi/2.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene remains a single square surface (surface 0) from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           We have two previously placed objects:
           - Object 4 (side 0.09846) at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. Its bounding box is approx `[-0.04923, 0.04923] x [-0.04923, 0.04923]`.
           - Object 6 (side 0.07069) at `(0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.0)`. Its bounding box is approx `[0.09 - 0.035345, 0.09 + 0.035345] x [-0.035345, 0.035345]`, which is `[0.054655, 0.125345] x [-0.035345, 0.035345]`.
           
           The new object (ID 5) is also square, with side length approximately 0.09898. Its half size is `0.09898 / 2 = 0.04949`.
           
           We need to place object 5 such that it's stable on surface 0 and does not collide with object 4 or object 6.
           The full surface extends from `-0.135` to `0.135`.
           For object 5, if `theta=0`, its half size is `0.04949`.
           The valid x and y range for its center would be `[-0.135 + 0.04949, 0.135 - 0.04949]`, which is `[-0.08551, 0.08551]`.
           
           Let's check the occupied regions:
           Object 4: `x in [-0.04923, 0.04923]`, `y in [-0.04923, 0.04923]`
           Object 6: `x in [0.054655, 0.125345]`, `y in [-0.035345, 0.035345]`
           
           We need to find a region for object 5 that does not overlap with these two.
           Notice that Object 6 is to the right of Object 4.
           The right edge of Object 4 is at `x=0.04923`. The left edge of Object 6 is at `x=0.054655`. There is a small gap between them.
           However, Object 5 is quite large (similar size to Object 4).
           
           If we place Object 5 to the left of Object 4:
           Its right edge must be `x <= -0.04923`. The center `x_5` would then need to be `x_5 <= -0.04923 - 0.04949 = -0.09872`.
           This is within the valid range `[-0.08551, 0.08551]` for its center only if we are very careful. For example, if `x_5 = -0.09`, its right edge is `-0.09 + 0.04949 = -0.04051`, which is not far enough to the left.
           To not collide with Object 4, `|x_5|` must be at least `0.04923 + 0.04949 = 0.09872`.
           So, if `x_5 = -0.09872`, its x-range is `[-0.14821, -0.04923]`. The left bound `x=-0.14821` is outside the surface `x_min=-0.135`.
           This means that with `theta=0` (or `pi/2`), we cannot place Object 5 directly to the left, right, top or bottom of Object 4 without either colliding with Object 4 or going off the surface.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the maximum possible extent for a square object of side `s=0.09898` on a surface `[-0.135, 0.135]`.
           The object half-width is `0.04949`.
           Max x-center is `0.135 - 0.04949 = 0.08551`. Min x-center is `-0.08551`.
           Max y-center is `0.08551`. Min y-center is `-0.08551`.
           
           So, for object 5 (ID 5) at `theta=0`:
           Its x-range is `[x_c - 0.04949, x_c + 0.04949]`.
           Its y-range is `[y_c - 0.04949, y_c + 0.04949]`.
           
           Collision with Object 4 (`[-0.04923, 0.04923] x [-0.04923, 0.04923]`):
           If `x_c > 0`: `x_c - 0.04949 >= 0.04923 => x_c >= 0.09872`. This implies `x_c` cannot be placed on the surface.
           If `x_c < 0`: `x_c + 0.04949 <= -0.04923 => x_c <= -0.09872`. This implies `x_c` cannot be placed on the surface.
           The same applies for `y_c`. This means Object 5 cannot be placed with `theta=0` (or `pi/2`) directly adjacent to Object 4 along any cardinal axis without collision or going off surface.
           
           Collision with Object 6 (`[0.054655, 0.125345] x [-0.035345, 0.035345]`):
           The x-range of Object 6 is `[0.054655, 0.125345]`.
           The y-range of Object 6 is `[-0.035345, 0.035345]`.
           
           This implies we need to place Object 5 in a corner, or at least in a quadrant, that avoids both.
           Let's consider the quadrant `x < 0` and `y < 0`.
           The center of Object 5 could be at `(-0.08, -0.08)`.
           If `x_5 = -0.08`, then `x_5_range = [-0.08 - 0.04949, -0.08 + 0.04949] = [-0.12949, -0.03051]`.
           This is within `[-0.135, 0.135]`.
           Similarly, `y_5_range = [-0.12949, -0.03051]`.
           Check for collision with Object 4: Object 5's x-range `[-0.12949, -0.03051]` does not overlap with Object 4's `[-0.04923, 0.04923]`. Object 5's y-range `[-0.12949, -0.03051]` does not overlap with Object 4's `[-0.04923, 0.04923]`. So no collision.
           Check for collision with Object 6: Object 5's x-range is `[-0.12949, -0.03051]` and Object 6's is `[0.054655, 0.125345]`. No x-overlap. No collision.
           
           So, a placement like `(0, 0.0, -0.08, -0.08)` for object 5 seems stable and collision-free.
           Other positions in the top-left `(x<0, y>0)` and bottom-right `(x>0, y<0)` quadrants might also work.
           For the top-left quadrant: `(-0.08, 0.08)`
           x-range: `[-0.12949, -0.03051]`.
           y-range: `[0.03051, 0.12949]`.
           This avoids Object 4 and Object 6.
           
           For the bottom-right quadrant: `(0.08, -0.08)`
           x-range: `[0.03051, 0.12949]`.
           y-range: `[-0.12949, -0.03051]`.
           This avoids Object 4.
           It overlaps with Object 6's x-range `[0.054655, 0.125345]` because `0.03051 < 0.054655`.
           And it overlaps with Object 6's y-range `[-0.035345, 0.035345]` because `-0.12949 < -0.035345`.
           Let's analyze this more carefully for `(0.08, -0.08)`:
           Object 5: `x in [0.03051, 0.12949]`, `y in [-0.12949, -0.03051]`
           Object 6: `x in [0.054655, 0.125345]`, `y in [-0.035345, 0.035345]`
           There is x-overlap: `[0.054655, 0.125345]` is fully contained in `[0.03051, 0.12949]`.
           There is no y-overlap: Object 5's y-max `(-0.03051)` is less than Object 6's y-min `(-0.035345)`. Wait, no, Object 5's y-max `(-0.03051)` is greater than Object 6's y-min `(-0.035345)`.
           And Object 5's y-min `(-0.12949)` is less than Object 6's y-min `(-0.035345)`.
           So Object 5 is below Object 6 along the y-axis, but they overlap in x. There is no collision in this case because there is no y-overlap.
           
           So, `(-0.08, -0.08)`, `(-0.08, 0.08)`, and `(0.08, -0.08)` are good candidates with `theta=0`.
           Let's also try some with `theta=pi/4`. A square rotated by pi/4 has a larger effective bounding box.
           For a square of side `s`, rotated by `pi/4`, the effective side length of its AABB is `s * sqrt(2)`.
           For object 5, `s = 0.09898`, so `s * sqrt(2) = 0.09898 * 1.41421356 = 0.13998`.
           Half of this is `0.06999`.
           The center range would be `[-0.135 + 0.06999, 0.135 - 0.06999]`, which is `[-0.06501, 0.06501]`.
           This is a much smaller range for the center.
           
           Let's try `(0, 0.7853981633974483, -0.06, 0.06)`.
           This means object 5 is rotated by 45 degrees, centered at `(-0.06, 0.06)`.
           Its bounding box would be approximately `[-0.06 - 0.06999, -0.06 + 0.06999]` = `[-0.12999, 0.00999]` for x.
           And `[0.06 - 0.06999, 0.06 + 0.06999]` = `[-0.00999, 0.12999]` for y.
           This is within the surface bounds `[-0.135, 0.135]`.
           Collision check:
           Object 4: `[-0.04923, 0.04923] x [-0.04923, 0.04923]`
           Object 5 (rotated): `[-0.12999, 0.00999] x [-0.00999, 0.12999]`
           x-overlap: `[-0.04923, 0.00999]` (non-empty)
           y-overlap: `[-0.00999, 0.04923]` (non-empty)
           This results in a collision between Object 5 and Object 4. So `(-0.06, 0.06)` with `pi/4` rotation is not good.
           
           We need to be more careful with rotated bounding boxes for collision.
           The minimum separation between the center of Object 4 and Object 5 (rotated by pi/4) would be:
           `half_size_4 + half_diagonal_5_AABB = 0.04923 + 0.06999 = 0.11922`.
           So `|x_5_center|` or `|y_5_center|` must be at least `0.11922` to avoid collision with Object 4.
           However, the max center coordinate is `0.06501` for Object 5 (rotated). This means there are no stable placements for Object 5 (rotated by `pi/4`) that avoid Object 4.
           This means for Object 5, we should stick to `theta=0` or `theta=pi/2`.
           
           Let's re-confirm that `(0.08, -0.08)` for Object 5 with `theta=0` avoids Object 6.
           Object 5 bounds: `x in [0.03051, 0.12949]`, `y in [-0.12949, -0.03051]`
           Object 6 bounds: `x in [0.054655, 0.125345]`, `y in [-0.035345, 0.035345]`
           There is no y-overlap since `max(y5) = -0.03051` and `min(y6) = -0.035345`. Oh wait, I made a mistake in the previous line.
           `max(y5) = -0.03051` is *greater* than `min(y6) = -0.035345`.
           `min(y5) = -0.12949`.
           So the interval `[-0.12949, -0.03051]` for y5 and `[-0.035345, 0.035345]` for y6 *do* overlap. The overlap is `[-0.035345, -0.03051]`.
           Since there is both x and y overlap, `(0.08, -0.08)` for Object 5 (theta=0) *collides* with Object 6. My apologies.
           
           Therefore, we must find a quadrant that avoids both or a narrow strip.
           The two safe quadrants seem to be the top-left (`x<0, y>0`) and bottom-left (`x<0, y<0`) regions, but carefully chosen.
           Let's consider `(-0.08, 0.08)` for Object 5 with `theta=0`.
           Object 5 bounds: `x in [-0.12949, -0.03051]`, `y in [0.03051, 0.12949]`
           Object 4: `x in [-0.04923, 0.04923]`, `y in [-0.04923, 0.04923]`
           No x-overlap (`max(x5) < min(x4)`). No collision with Object 4.
           Object 6: `x in [0.054655, 0.125345]`, `y in [-0.035345, 0.035345]`
           No x-overlap (`max(x5) < min(x6)`). No collision with Object 6.
           So `(0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.08)` is a valid placement.
           
           Let's check `(-0.08, -0.08)` for Object 5 with `theta=0`.
           Object 5 bounds: `x in [-0.12949, -0.03051]`, `y in [-0.12949, -0.03051]`
           Object 4: `x in [-0.04923, 0.04923]`, `y in [-0.04923, 0.04923]`
           No x-overlap. No y-overlap. No collision with Object 4.
           Object 6: `x in [0.054655, 0.125345]`, `y in [-0.035345, 0.035345]`
           No x-overlap. No collision with Object 6.
           So `(0, 0.0, -0.08, -0.08)` is also a valid placement.
           
           I'll generate placements mainly in the left half of the surface, with various y-coordinates to make sure it's diverse. I will use `theta=0` and `theta=pi/2` as these are the most compact orientations for a square.
           
           Placements:
           (0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.08)
           (0, 0.0, -0.08, -0.08)
           (0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.0) # Check this one again. x in [-0.12949, -0.03051], y in [-0.04949, 0.04949]. This y overlaps with obj4 and obj6 y-ranges. So this is a collision. Not good.
           (0, 0.0, -0.07, 0.08)
           (0, 0.0, -0.07, -0.08)
           (0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.07)
           (0, 0.0, -0.08, -0.07)
           (0, 1.5707963267948966, -0.08, 0.08)
           (0, 1.5707963267948966, -0.08, -0.08)
           (0, 1.5707963267948966, -0.07, 0.08)
           (0, 1.5707963267948966, -0.07, -0.08)
           (0, 1.5707963267948966, -0.08, 0.07)
           (0, 1.5707963267948966, -0.08, -0.07)
           (0, 0.0, -0.085, 0.085)
           (0, 0.0, -0.085, -0.085)
           (0, 0.0, -0.085, 0.0) # collision
           (0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.0) # collision
           (0, 1.5707963267948966, -0.085, 0.085)
           (0, 1.5707963267948966, -0.085, -0.085)
           (0, 1.5707963267948966, -0.085, 0.0) # collision
           (0, 1.5707963267948966, -0.08, 0.0) # collision
           
           Okay, let's refine the strategy.
           Current objects and their approximate bounds:
           Obj 4 (ID 4, s=0.09846): `x in [-0.04923, 0.04923]`, `y in [-0.04923, 0.04923]` (center (0,0))
           Obj 6 (ID 6, s=0.07069): `x in [0.054655, 0.125345]`, `y in [-0.035345, 0.035345]` (center (0.09, 0))
           New Obj 5 (ID 5, s=0.09898): half-size `0.04949`.
           Surface 0 bounds: `[-0.135, 0.135]` in x and y.
           
           We need to place Obj 5 (center `(x5, y5)`, `theta5`).
           If `theta5 = 0` or `pi/2`, Obj 5 occupies `[x5-0.04949, x5+0.04949] x [y5-0.04949, y5+0.04949]`.
           To not collide with Obj 4:
           `x5+0.04949 <= -0.04923` (left of Obj 4) => `x5 <= -0.09872`
           `x5-0.04949 >= 0.04923` (right of Obj 4) => `x5 >= 0.09872`
           `y5+0.04949 <= -0.04923` (below Obj 4) => `y5 <= -0.09872`
           `y5-0.04949 >= 0.04923` (above Obj 4) => `y5 >= 0.09872`
           
           Let's check `x5 <= -0.09872`. The min possible `x5` for stability is `-0.135 + 0.04949 = -0.08551`.
           Since `-0.09872` is less than `-0.08551`, there is no `x5` (or `y5`) that puts Obj 5 entirely to one cardinal side of Obj 4 *without* exceeding the surface boundary. This means Obj 5's bounding box will always overlap with the x or y extent of Obj 4 if we try to place it directly adjacent.
           
           Therefore, Obj 5 must be placed in a corner quadrant such that its extent does not cross the origin lines or very minimally.
           We found `(-0.08, 0.08)` and `(-0.08, -0.08)` for Obj 5 (theta=0 or pi/2) are valid.
           Let's confirm the corner `(0.08, 0.08)` with theta=0.
           Obj 5: `x in [0.03051, 0.12949]`, `y in [0.03051, 0.12949]`
           Obj 4: `x in [-0.04923, 0.04923]`, `y in [-0.04923, 0.04923]`
           No x-overlap. No y-overlap. No collision with Obj 4.
           Obj 6: `x in [0.054655, 0.125345]`, `y in [-0.035345, 0.035345]`
           x-overlap: `[0.054655, 0.125345]` is within `[0.03051, 0.12949]`.
           No y-overlap: `min(y5) = 0.03051` is greater than `max(y6) = 0.035345`. This is a miss. No. `min(y5) = 0.03051` and `max(y6) = 0.035345`.
           `min(y5)=0.03051`
           `max(y6)=0.035345`
           This is confusing because `0.03051` is less than `0.035345`. So the max y of obj6 is higher than min y of obj5.
           Let's compare intervals properly for `(0.08, 0.08)` of Obj 5 (theta=0) and Obj 6:
           Obj 5 y: `[0.03051, 0.12949]`
           Obj 6 y: `[-0.035345, 0.035345]`
           There is y-overlap: `[0.03051, 0.035345]`.
           Since there is both x and y overlap, `(0.08, 0.08)` for Obj 5 (theta=0) *collides* with Obj 6.
           
           This means only the top-left and bottom-left quadrants are safe for Obj 5, when `theta=0` or `pi/2`.
           The right half of the surface `(x>0)` is problematic because of Obj 6.
           Let's try to place Obj 5 in the top-left quadrant (`x < 0, y > 0`) and bottom-left (`x < 0, y < 0`).
           The x-range for Obj 5 needs to be `x < -0.04923`. The most left it can be is `x=-0.08551`.
           The right edge of Obj 5: `-0.08551 + 0.04949 = -0.03602`. This does not collide with Obj 4.
           The y-range for Obj 5 in the top-left quadrant (for example, `y=0.08`):
           `[0.03051, 0.12949]`. This does not collide with Obj 4 y-range `[-0.04923, 0.04923]`.
           This also doesn't collide with Obj 6 because Obj 5's x-range `[-0.135, -0.03602]` does not overlap with Obj 6's x-range `[0.054655, 0.125345]`.
           
           So, any placement in the *left half of the surface* is valid, as long as its y-range does not overlap with Obj 4 (or Obj 6, but Obj 6 is in the right half so Obj 5 x-extent already separates them).
           So we need `y5` such that `[y5-0.04949, y5+0.04949]` does not overlap with `[-0.04923, 0.04923]`.
           This means `y5 >= 0.09872` or `y5 <= -0.09872`.
           But again, the maximum `y5` for stability is `0.08551`. So no `y5` that completely avoids Obj 4 along the y-axis (if x overlaps).
           
           However, the placements like `(-0.08, 0.08)` work because the *x-ranges do not overlap*.
           Obj 5 at `(-0.08, 0.08)`: `x: [-0.12949, -0.03051]`, `y: [0.03051, 0.12949]`
           Obj 4 at `(0,0)`: `x: [-0.04923, 0.04923]`, `y: [-0.04923, 0.04923]`
           Since `max(x5) = -0.03051` which is less than `min(x4) = -0.04923`, there is no x-overlap. This is indeed correct. My earlier reasoning was correct that these specific corner placements are valid.
           
           Let's generate placements within these regions:
           Region 1 (top-left): `x in [-0.08551, -0.04923-0.04949/2]` for x, `y in [0.04923+0.04949/2, 0.08551]` for y. This is not quite right.
           The condition for no collision in an AABB is that either (max_x1 < min_x2 or min_x1 > max_x2) OR (max_y1 < min_y2 or min_y1 > max_y2).
           So if we want to place Object 5 at `(x_c, y_c)` with `theta=0`:
           1. Check surface bounds: `x_c +/- 0.04949` must be in `[-0.135, 0.135]`. So `x_c, y_c` in `[-0.08551, 0.08551]`.
           2. Check collision with Object 4:
              AABB4: `[-0.04923, 0.04923] x [-0.04923, 0.04923]`
              AABB5: `[x_c-0.04949, x_c+0.04949] x [y_c-0.04949, y_c+0.04949]`
              No collision if:
              `x_c+0.04949 <= -0.04923` (i.e. `x_c <= -0.09872`) OR
              `x_c-0.04949 >= 0.04923` (i.e. `x_c >= 0.09872`) OR
              `y_c+0.04949 <= -0.04923` (i.e. `y_c <= -0.09872`) OR
              `y_c-0.04949 >= 0.04923` (i.e. `y_c >= 0.09872`)
              As shown before, none of these conditions can be met due to surface bounds.
              This means any placement of Object 5 (theta=0 or pi/2) that keeps its center within `[-0.08551, 0.08551]` *will have its AABB overlap with Object 4's AABB*.
              This implies that object 5 cannot be placed stably with `theta=0` or `pi/2` without colliding with object 4, if the standard AABB collision is the only metric. This cannot be right. The previous checks showed that `(-0.08, 0.08)` was valid.
           
           Let's re-verify the AABB collision logic carefully for `(x1, y1, w1, h1)` and `(x2, y2, w2, h2)`:
           No collision if:
           `abs(center_x1 - center_x2) > (w1/2 + w2/2)` OR
           `abs(center_y1 - center_y2) > (h1/2 + h2/2)`
           
           For Obj 4 (ID 4) centered at `(0,0)`, half-size `0.04923`.
           For Obj 5 (ID 5) centered at `(x_c, y_c)`, half-size `0.04949`.
           No collision if:
           `abs(x_c - 0) > (0.04923 + 0.04949) = 0.09872` OR
           `abs(y_c - 0) > (0.04923 + 0.04949) = 0.09872`
           
           However, the max `|x_c|` or `|y_c|` for Obj 5 to be on the surface is `0.08551`.
           Since `0.08551 < 0.09872`, this means it's IMPOSSIBLE to place Object 5 without collision if both x and y overlaps with Object 4's *center*.
           This is a critical insight. It means that the previous successful placements must have passed because the geometry of the objects are not represented exactly by their AABBs for collision. Or I misunderstood previous feedback.
           
           The problem states "the object is fully contained within the bounds of the surface" and "collision with any of the fixed obstacles".
           This usually means AABB collision. If my calculation shows collision, then it should fail.
           Let me reconsider the problem statement: "The geometry of the surfaces will be described as a list of axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs), while the geometry of the object will be described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)."
           
           This implies AABB for everything. So my collision check `abs(center_x1 - center_x2) > (w1/2 + w2/2)` is correct.
           This means that Object 5 *cannot* be placed if Object 4 is present.
           There might be a slight difference in numbers causing this.
           Obj 4 half-size: 0.09845887988884972 / 2 = 0.04922943994442486
           Obj 5 half-size: 0.09898128951003458 / 2 = 0.04949064475501729
           Sum of half-sizes = 0.04922943994442486 + 0.04949064475501729 = 0.09872008469944215
           
           Max center for Obj 5 on surface: 0.135 - 0.04949064475501729 = 0.08550935524498271
           Since `0.08550935524498271 < 0.09872008469944215`, it means for *any* placement of Object 5 where its center is within the surface limits, `abs(x_c)` or `abs(y_c)` will always be less than `0.09872...`.
           This implies that Obj 5's AABB will always overlap with Obj 4's AABB if Obj 4 is at `(0,0)`.
           
           There must be a misunderstanding on my part.
           Could the "feedback of whether a placement is stable and whether it collides with any of the fixed obstacles in the scene" imply that the collision check is not always simple AABB for *all* objects? The problem says "fixed obstacles" (plural). Perhaps the previous object placements are not considered "fixed obstacles" in the same sense as the surface itself. This is confusing.
           
           "If you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene."
           This implies previous placements *can* become non-fixed obstacles. And I must avoid collision.
           
           Maybe the effective AABB is slightly smaller due to some internal rounding, or there's a small margin?
           Let's try to place it as far as possible from the center.
           E.g. `(0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.0)`
           Obj 5 bounds: `[0.085 - 0.04949, 0.085 + 0.04949]` = `[0.03551, 0.13449]` for x.
           `[-0.04949, 0.04949]` for y.
           This is within surface.
           Collides with Obj 4? `abs(0.085) = 0.085 < 0.09872`. So yes, according to strict AABB logic, it collides.
           
           This is a contradictory situation based on the simple AABB logic.
           Given that the previous user message shows a *success* for Object 4 at `(0,0)` and Object 6 at `(0.09,0)`, it means these placements were valid.
           Let's re-examine that successful configuration for Obj 4 and Obj 6:
           Obj 4 AABB: `[-0.04923, 0.04923] x [-0.04923, 0.04923]`
           Obj 6 AABB: `[0.054655, 0.125345] x [-0.035345, 0.035345]`
           Check for collision between Obj 4 and Obj 6:
           `abs(x4-x6) = abs(0 - 0.09) = 0.09`
           `sum of half-widths = 0.04923 + 0.035345 = 0.084575`
           Since `0.09 > 0.084575`, there is no x-overlap.
           Therefore, the placement of Obj 4 and Obj 6 being successful *is consistent with AABB collision logic*.
           
           Now, back to Obj 5:
           Obj 5 half-size `0.04949`.
           Collision with Obj 4 at `(0,0)`:
           We need `abs(x_c)` or `abs(y_c)` to be greater than `0.04923 + 0.04949 = 0.09872`.
           But the max `|x_c|` or `|y_c|` for Obj 5 to be on surface is `0.135 - 0.04949 = 0.08551`.
           Since `0.08551 < 0.09872`, this *proves* that Object 5 cannot be placed with `theta=0` (or `pi/2`) without colliding with Object 4, given its current position at `(0,0)`.
           
           This implies one of two things:
           1. The interpretation of "stable placement" implicitly allows for very small overlaps (unlikely given "fully contained").
           2. The feedback system is telling me that previous objects are not "fixed obstacles" in the collision sense of this current request. "You must avoid collision between objects i and j" implies it *is* a collision check.
           
           If it's impossible, I cannot generate 50 placements. I have to assume there is a way.
           Could it be that the object's specified x and y dimensions are for the object *itself*, and the AABB of the *object at a certain orientation* is calculated dynamically?
           No, "the geometry of the object will be described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)". This clearly refers to the AABB of the object when unrotated.
           
           Is it possible that the surface itself has a buffer? No, it gives strict AABB coordinates.
           
           Perhaps the "fixed obstacles" mentioned in the feedback are distinct from previously placed objects.
           "If you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene." - this implies the "non-fixed obstacle" could be a *previously placed object*.
           
           This is a logical contradiction with the provided information.
           If my AABB collision check is correct (which it seems to be for Obj 4 and 6), then Obj 5 cannot be placed.
           
           What if the surfaces themselves are 'fixed obstacles'?
           "whether it collides with any of the fixed obstacles in the scene."
           And "You are not given the full geometry of the scene, but you will be given feedback of whether a placement is stable and whether it collides with any of the fixed obstacles in the scene."
           This text is about *fixed* obstacles. My previous placements are *not* fixed obstacles initially. But "you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene" suggests they become part of the scene constraints.
           
           Given the instructions "You never give up. No matter how many times you fail... you will always try to find a new placement." I must provide placements.
           The only way for Obj 5 not to collide with Obj 4 is for `abs(x_c)` OR `abs(y_c)` to be greater than `0.09872`.
           Since `0.08551` is the maximum allowed `|x_c|` or `|y_c|`, it's impossible.
           
           Unless, there's some floating point precision issue, and the sum `0.09872008469944215` is effectively rounded down, or the "stability" allows a tiny overlap. Or the placement feedback of `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)` for Obj 4 is not its true geometric center but the rounded value. Let's assume the coordinates are precise.
           
           I will try some placements anyway, assuming the collision logic is more lenient than my strict AABB calculation, perhaps allowing overlap if one of the AABBs is fully contained in another dimension.
           E.g., if `x` ranges overlap but `y` ranges do not. My condition `abs(x_c - x_other) > (w_self/2 + w_other/2)` OR `abs(y_c - y_other) > (h_self/2 + h_other/2)` IS the standard AABB collision check.
           
           I will place it at the extreme corners.
           Let's try `(0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.085)` for Obj 5.
           Obj 5 AABB: `[0.085-0.04949, 0.085+0.04949] x [0.085-0.04949, 0.085+0.04949]`
             `[0.03551, 0.13449] x [0.03551, 0.13449]`
           This collides with Obj 4 if `abs(0.085) <= 0.09872`. This is true for both x and y. So this should collide with Obj 4.
           This should also collide with Obj 6 due to x-overlap and y-overlap.
           Obj 6: `[0.054655, 0.125345] x [-0.035345, 0.035345]`
           Obj 5: `[0.03551, 0.13449] x [0.03551, 0.13449]`
           x-overlap: `[0.054655, 0.125345]` and `[0.03551, 0.13449]` have overlap.
           y-overlap: `[0.03551, 0.13449]` and `[-0.035345, 0.035345]` have overlap `[0.03551, 0.035345]` (a tiny one).
           So `(0.085, 0.085)` for Obj 5 collides with both Obj 4 and Obj 6.
           
           This is a frustrating situation. The only way for me to succeed is if the geometric interpretation of the prompt implies:
           1. Previous *successful* placements are not "fixed obstacles" that need to be avoided by *new* placements. This seems to contradict "you must avoid collision between objects i and j".
           2. The collision check is more complex than simple AABB overlap for previously placed objects.
           
           Given the contradiction, I will try to place the object in a "corner" far from the existing objects, even if my strict AABB calculation says it *should* collide. I will prioritize being within surface bounds. And I will rely on the learning process.
           
           I will assume the collision model is simply that AABBs must not overlap. If so, there are NO valid placements for Object 5.
           However, I was given `(ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0` and `(ID: 6) -- 0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.0` as "successes" (non-colliding with *fixed* obstacles), and the new request implies I must avoid collision with these. This suggests they are "non-fixed obstacles" that become part of the scene geometry.
           
           The only way I can possibly achieve non-overlap with Object 4 is if one of the `abs(x_c)` or `abs(y_c)` values is indeed `> 0.09872`.
           This means the surface bounds might be slightly larger, or the objects slightly smaller than specified, or the half-sizes are rounded down more leniently during internal collision checks.
           
           I will proceed by placing object 5 at the maximum possible extreme coordinates, hoping for a lenient collision check, or that my calculation is off by a small margin due to floating point.
           The maximum valid center coordinate is `0.08550935524498271`. Let's use `0.085`.
           So `(0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.085)` will put Obj 5 AABB at `[0.03551, 0.13449] x [0.03551, 0.13449]`.
           This is where the collision check for Obj4 and Obj6 comes in.
           Obj4 x: `[-0.04923, 0.04923]`, y: `[-0.04923, 0.04923]`
           Obj6 x: `[0.054655, 0.125345]`, y: `[-0.035345, 0.035345]`
           
           If Obj 5 is at `(0.085, 0.085)`:
           x-interval: `[0.03551, 0.13449]`
           y-interval: `[0.03551, 0.13449]`
           
           Collides with Obj 4? Yes, x-overlap `[0.03551, 0.04923]`. y-overlap `[0.03551, 0.04923]`.
           Collides with Obj 6? Yes, x-overlap `[0.054655, 0.125345]` is within `[0.03551, 0.13449]`.
           y-overlap `[0.03551, 0.035345]` is actually not an overlap. `min(y5)=0.03551`, `max(y6)=0.035345`. `min(y5) > max(y6)`. So no y-overlap. Thus no collision with Obj 6.
           So `(0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.085)` collides with Obj 4 but not Obj 6.
           
           This logic is hard. I'll stick to the conclusion that `(-0.08, 0.08)` and `(-0.08, -0.08)` were good for Obj 5 (theta=0) in my earlier calculation, because Obj 5's AABB did not x-overlap with Obj 4's.
           
           Let's re-examine `(-0.08, 0.08)` for Obj 5 (theta=0).
           Obj 5 AABB: `x in [-0.12949, -0.03051]`, `y in [0.03051, 0.12949]`
           Obj 4 AABB: `x in [-0.04923, 0.04923]`, `y in [-0.04923, 0.04923]`
           No x-overlap because `max(x5) = -0.03051` which is less than `min(x4) = -0.04923`. So no collision with Obj 4. This is correct.
           
           Obj 6 AABB: `x in [0.054655, 0.125345]`, `y in [-0.035345, 0.035345]`
           No x-overlap because `max(x5) = -0.03051` which is less than `min(x6) = 0.054655`. So no collision with Obj 6. This is also correct.
           
           Therefore, `(-0.08, 0.08)` (and by symmetry `(-0.08, -0.08)`) is a valid placement for Object 5, both from surface and existing object collision perspectives.
           
           My confusion arose from a flawed general statement about `abs(x_c)` needing to be greater than a certain threshold. The full AABB collision condition involving OR logic (either x-axes don't overlap OR y-axes don't overlap) means that if we can ensure x-axes don't overlap (even if y-axes do) then there is no collision. In this case, placing Obj 5 to the far left achieves non-overlap in the x-axis with both Obj 4 and Obj 6.
           
           I will generate placements mainly in the left half, specifically the top-left and bottom-left "quadrants" where the x-axis does not overlap with previously placed objects.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene remains a single square surface (surface 0) from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           We have three previously placed objects:
           - Object 4 (side 0.09846) at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. Its AABB is `[-0.04923, 0.04923] x [-0.04923, 0.04923]`.
           - Object 6 (side 0.07069) at `(0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.0)`. Its AABB is `[0.054655, 0.125345] x [-0.035345, 0.035345]`.
           - Object 5 (side 0.09898) at `(0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.08)`. Its AABB is `[-0.12949, -0.03051] x [0.03051, 0.12949]`.
           
           The new object (ID 7) is also square, with side length approximately 0.08433. Its half size is `0.08433 / 2 = 0.042165`.
           
           We need to place object 7 such that it's stable on surface 0 and does not collide with object 4, object 6, or object 5.
           The full surface extends from `-0.135` to `0.135`.
           For object 7, if `theta=0` (or `pi/2`), its half size is `0.042165`.
           The valid range for the center of object 7 (if alone) would be:
           x: `-0.135 + 0.042165` to `0.135 - 0.042165`, which is `[-0.092835, 0.092835]`.
           y: `[-0.092835, 0.092835]`.
           
           Let's list the occupied regions by x-intervals and y-intervals:
           Obj 4 (ID 4): `x4_range = [-0.04923, 0.04923]`, `y4_range = [-0.04923, 0.04923]`
           Obj 6 (ID 6): `x6_range = [0.054655, 0.125345]`, `y6_range = [-0.035345, 0.035345]`
           Obj 5 (ID 5): `x5_range = [-0.12949, -0.03051]`, `y5_range = [0.03051, 0.12949]`
           
           We need to find a space for Obj 7 with AABB `[x7_c - 0.042165, x7_c + 0.042165] x [y7_c - 0.042165, y7_c + 0.042165]`.
           
           Let's analyze the free space.
           The x-axis looks like this:
           `[S-0.135 - - - - Obj5_max(-0.03051) - - - Obj4_min(-0.04923) -- Obj4_max(0.04923) -- Obj6_min(0.054655) - - - Obj6_max(0.125345) - - - S_0.135]`
           It means Obj 5 is to the left of Obj 4. Obj 6 is to the right of Obj 4.
           The gap between Obj 5 and Obj 4 on the x-axis is `[-0.04923, -0.03051]`. This is very narrow.
           
           Let's look at the y-axis:
           Obj 4: `[-0.04923, 0.04923]`
           Obj 6: `[-0.035345, 0.035345]` (roughly centered on y-axis, but a smaller y-range)
           Obj 5: `[0.03051, 0.12949]` (top-left)
           
           Consider the bottom-right quadrant (`x > 0, y < 0`).
           Object 4's x-range is `[-0.04923, 0.04923]`. Object 6's x-range is `[0.054655, 0.125345]`.
           Object 4's y-range is `[-0.04923, 0.04923]`. Object 6's y-range is `[-0.035345, 0.035345]`.
           
           Let's try to place Obj 7 at `(0.08, -0.08)` with `theta=0`.
           Obj 7 AABB would be `[0.08 - 0.042165, 0.08 + 0.042165] x [-0.08 - 0.042165, -0.08 + 0.042165]`
           `[0.037835, 0.122165] x [-0.122165, -0.037835]`
           This is within surface bounds `[-0.135, 0.135]`.
           
           Collision check with Obj 4:
           Obj 7 x-range: `[0.037835, 0.122165]`
           Obj 4 x-range: `[-0.04923, 0.04923]`
           No x-overlap (`min(x7) > max(x4)`). No collision with Obj 4.
           
           Collision check with Obj 6:
           Obj 7 x-range: `[0.037835, 0.122165]`
           Obj 6 x-range: `[0.054655, 0.125345]`
           There is x-overlap: `[0.054655, 0.122165]`.
           Obj 7 y-range: `[-0.122165, -0.037835]`
           Obj 6 y-range: `[-0.035345, 0.035345]`
           No y-overlap (`max(y7) < min(y6)`). So no collision with Obj 6.
           
           Collision check with Obj 5:
           Obj 7 x-range: `[0.037835, 0.122165]`
           Obj 5 x-range: `[-0.12949, -0.03051]`
           No x-overlap (`min(x7) > max(x5)`). No collision with Obj 5.
           
           So, `(0, 0.0, 0.08, -0.08)` is a valid placement for Object 7.
           
           Let's try to find more placements in the bottom-right quadrant `(x > 0, y < 0)`.
           We need to ensure `x7_center + 0.042165 <= 0.135` (`x7_center <= 0.092835`)
           And `y7_center - 0.042165 >= -0.135` (`y7_center >= -0.092835`)
           
           We want `x7_center - 0.042165` to be `>= 0.04923` to avoid Obj 4 along x, which means `x7_center >= 0.091395`. This is very close to the surface boundary.
           Or, `y7_center + 0.042165` to be `<= -0.04923` to avoid Obj 4 along y, which means `y7_center <= -0.091395`. This is also close.
           
           Let's re-examine `(0.08, -0.08)`. The x-coordinates avoid Obj 4 and y-coordinates avoid Obj 6. This is fine.
           
           We can try slightly different coordinates in the `x > 0, y < 0` area.
           For example `(0.085, -0.085)`.
           Obj 7 AABB: `[0.085 - 0.042165, 0.085 + 0.042165] x [-0.085 - 0.042165, -0.085 + 0.042165]`
           `[0.042835, 0.127165] x [-0.127165, -0.042835]`
           This is within surface `[-0.135, 0.135]`.
           
           Collision check with Obj 4:
           Obj 7 x-range: `[0.042835, 0.127165]`
           Obj 4 x-range: `[-0.04923, 0.04923]`
           No x-overlap (`min(x7) > max(x4)`). No collision with Obj 4.
           
           Collision check with Obj 6:
           Obj 7 x-range: `[0.042835, 0.127165]`
           Obj 6 x-range: `[0.054655, 0.125345]`
           There is x-overlap: `[0.054655, 0.125345]`. (Obj 6 x-range is almost contained within Obj 7's)
           Obj 7 y-range: `[-0.127165, -0.042835]`
           Obj 6 y-range: `[-0.035345, 0.035345]`
           No y-overlap (`max(y7) < min(y6)`). So no collision with Obj 6.
           
           Collision check with Obj 5:
           Obj 7 x-range: `[0.042835, 0.127165]`
           Obj 5 x-range: `[-0.12949, -0.03051]`
           No x-overlap. No collision with Obj 5.
           
           So `(0, 0.0, 0.085, -0.085)` is also a valid placement.
           
           I can also try placements along the bottom edge, where `y_c` is small negative, but `x_c` is somewhat left of Obj 4 (so `x_c < -0.04923 + 0.042165 = -0.007065`) or between Obj 4 and Obj 6.
           But these seem riskier due to the congestion in the middle. The corners are usually safer.
           
           Let's try the bottom-left quadrant `(x < 0, y < 0)`.
           Obj 5 is in top-left. Obj 4 is center. Obj 6 is center-right.
           So `x < 0, y < 0` area:
           Consider `(-0.08, -0.08)`.
           Obj 7 AABB: `[-0.08 - 0.042165, -0.08 + 0.042165] x [-0.08 - 0.042165, -0.08 + 0.042165]`
           `[-0.122165, -0.037835] x [-0.122165, -0.037835]`
           Within surface `[-0.135, 0.135]`.
           
           Collision check with Obj 4:
           Obj 7 x-range: `[-0.122165, -0.037835]`
           Obj 4 x-range: `[-0.04923, 0.04923]`
           x-overlap: `[-0.04923, -0.037835]`.
           Obj 7 y-range: `[-0.122165, -0.037835]`
           Obj 4 y-range: `[-0.04923, 0.04923]`
           y-overlap: `[-0.04923, -0.037835]`.
           This means it *collides* with Obj 4. So `(-0.08, -0.08)` for Obj 7 is not valid.
           
           The safe zone is primarily the bottom-right corner.
           Also, the top-right corner `(x > 0, y > 0)` could be free.
           Let's try `(0.08, 0.08)` for Obj 7 with `theta=0`.
           Obj 7 AABB: `[0.037835, 0.122165] x [0.037835, 0.122165]`
           Within surface `[-0.135, 0.135]`.
           
           Collision check with Obj 4:
           Obj 7 x-range: `[0.037835, 0.122165]`
           Obj 4 x-range: `[-0.04923, 0.04923]`
           No x-overlap. No collision with Obj 4.
           
           Collision check with Obj 6:
           Obj 7 x-range: `[0.037835, 0.122165]`
           Obj 6 x-range: `[0.054655, 0.125345]`
           x-overlap: `[0.054655, 0.122165]`.
           Obj 7 y-range: `[0.037835, 0.122165]`
           Obj 6 y-range: `[-0.035345, 0.035345]`
           No y-overlap (`min(y7) > max(y6)`). No collision with Obj 6.
           
           Collision check with Obj 5:
           Obj 7 x-range: `[0.037835, 0.122165]`
           Obj 5 x-range: `[-0.12949, -0.03051]`
           No x-overlap. No collision with Obj 5.
           
           So `(0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.08)` is a valid placement for Object 7.
           
           So, the top-right `(x>0, y>0)` and bottom-right `(x>0, y<0)` quadrants are the safe zones for Obj 7.
           I will generate placements in these two quadrants, using `theta=0` and `theta=pi/2`.
