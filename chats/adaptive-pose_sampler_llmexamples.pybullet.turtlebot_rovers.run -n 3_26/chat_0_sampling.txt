User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with inner limits from -2.45 to 2.45 in both x and y. There's a vertical wall in the middle at x=0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered around. I'll need to avoid these obstacles when choosing base positions. I will try to place the robot in various locations around the target, keeping in mind the max distance and the room boundaries. I'll also try to keep a diverse set of positions to maximize the chances of finding valid placements.
