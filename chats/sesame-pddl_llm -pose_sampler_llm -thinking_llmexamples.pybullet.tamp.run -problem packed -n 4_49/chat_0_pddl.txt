(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for a Square Object**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to come up with 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 4) on a square surface. The object's dimensions are roughly 0.077 units by 0.077 units, and the surface is a square centered at (0,0) with sides of 0.27 units.  I've got to define, for each placement, `surf_idx`, `theta` (rotation angle), and the center position `(x, y)`. The `surf_idx` is fixed at 0.
           
           Since the object is square, its bounding box changes shape as it rotates. I've worked out the equations for the dimensions of the rotated bounding box based on the initial side length (`s = 0.077`), and the rotation angle (`theta`).  The key is realizing that the maximum bounding box size occurs at 45 degrees (or its equivalents), where the AABB is `s * sqrt(2)`. The minimum is when `theta` is a multiple of pi/2, where the AABB side is just the initial `s`.
           
           To get 50 diverse placements, I can vary `theta` and the center position `(x, y)`. I've chosen to use 5 angles that cover the relevant AABB shapes: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2.  Then I chose a grid of 5x5 position coordinates for each angle. The range for `(x,y)` is limited by the fact that the bounding box must be fully inside the square surface. This lets me use 25 total placements for the five angles I have chosen, covering diverse positions and orientations. I have verified that each position is valid.
           
           I've made sure to calculate the valid `(x, y)` ranges for each rotation angle by taking the half-width and half-height of the rotated bounding box and ensuring that the object's AABB remains within the surface boundaries, using `numpy` for precise calculations. To ensure that the placements are valid, I checked that the edge positions are within the surface boundaries.

(Thoughts: **Alright, here's the plan for placing Object 5 on Surface 0 while avoiding Object 4, as I see it:**
           
           I've got the go-ahead that the placement `(0, 0.0, -0.0868791861619, -0.0868791861619)` for Object 4 is valid. That's a key piece of information.  Now, I'm dealing with the square Surface 0, measuring 0.27 on a side, centered at (0,0).  Object 5 is a square with side length `0.09522893875281746`, which I'll be trying to place.
           
           My main concern is making sure Object 5 doesn't crash into Object 4, which has a size of 0.07693514186244843. Object 4 is located at `(surf_idx=0, theta=0.0, x=-0.0868791861619, y=-0.0868791861619)`. So, I'll need to calculate the bounding box, AABB, of Object 4. It comes out to be `((-0.1253467570931224, -0.1253467570931224), (-0.04841161523067648, -0.04841161523067648))`.
           
           To safely place Object 5, I'll first figure out the valid placements for Object 5 at `theta=0`. This will give the smallest bounding box so I can put many more objects. The valid x-y ranges are calculated to be -0.087, 0.087 for theta=0, and similar calculations for `theta = pi/4`. My thought is that I should have a good spread of placements.
           
           Now for placing Object 5, I will take into account the collision with Object 4's AABB.
           
           I'll generate a grid of points on the surface and check if each point would cause a collision between O5 and O4. I'll pick points from grids for `theta=0`, `theta=pi/4`, and `theta=pi/2` and calculate the bounding boxes and check for collision.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Object Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. I need to figure out 50 stable positions for object ID 6 on surface 0, taking into account the already-placed objects (IDs 4 and 5) as obstacles.
           
           I'm starting by defining the scene geometry – specifically, the dimensions and center of the surface. Then, I'll analyze the position, dimensions, and rotation of objects 4 and 5. I need to calculate their Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) to efficiently check for collisions.
           
           For the new object (ID 6), I know its size. To generate diverse placements, I'll use rotations of 0, π/4, and π/2. For each rotation, I'll:
           
           1.  Calculate object 6's AABB dimensions.
           2.  Determine the maximum allowed range for the object's center to stay within the surface.
           3.  Calculate "collision exclusion zones" based on the AABBs of the existing obstacles. This means figuring out the area where the *center* of object 6 cannot be to avoid overlap.
           
           To find these exclusion zones, I'll calculate the boundaries where the AABBs of the new object and the existing objects would overlap. 
           
           I'll use a grid-based approach. For each rotation, I'll create a grid of potential center positions. I'll then check each grid point to see if it collides with either object 4 or 5.  This means: I'll use the AABBs of each object and define collision as having overlapping X and Y coordinates. If a point on the grid does *not* overlap (is outside the exclusion zones I calculated), it's a valid placement.
           
           For `theta=0`, I'm going to create placements using a 7x7 grid. I will choose all the grid points which don't collide. For `theta=π/4`, I will also use a 7x7 grid and check these points. 
           
           Because the AABB extents for `theta=0` are equal to the AABB extents for `theta=π/2`, I can re-use the collision check logic. I will only select 15 placements for `theta=pi/2` and add them to the previous placements.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out 50 stable locations for Object 7 on Surface 0, while making sure it doesn't collide with the three fixed obstacles already there. Surface 0 is a square with a half-side length of 0.135. The obstacles (IDs 4, 5, and 6) have their dimensions and positions given as AABBs, and Object 7 is also a square, with a side length of 0.0915.
           
           The plan is to try different rotations for Object 7: 0, pi/4, and pi/2. For each, I calculate the half-width and half-height. Then, I calculate the valid range for the center of Object 7 to be within Surface 0. Next, I generate a grid of candidate center points within that range. For each candidate center point, I check for collisions with the AABBs of all three obstacles. A collision happens if the center point, considering Object 7's dimensions, falls within the obstacle's AABB expanded by half of Object 7's dimensions.
           
           I've got the exact AABB coordinates and dimensions for each object. For the rotations 0 and pi/2, the AABB is just the original side length. For pi/4, I need to account for the diagonal and calculate it using the square root of 2.
           
           I started by generating a 7x7 grid and doing this check manually. I found that I get very few valid placements per grid and, as a result, I had to expand to a 10x10 grid with `theta=0`. After going through this manual analysis, I then increased the grid size to get the needed 50 points by going to 10 x 10 with the `theta = 0` orientation. Then the remaining spaces are filled using the `theta = pi/4`.
