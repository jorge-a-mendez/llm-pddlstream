           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's how I'm thinking about solving this planning problem:**
           
           I need to get objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`.  Currently, they're all on `v11`.  Since the goal is `on(object, target)`, I know I need to satisfy `supported(object, ?p, target)` and `atpose(object, ?p)` for each of the objects.  I see that currently, the objects are supported by `v11`, but I need to move them to `v16`.
           
           The facts about `v16` tell me that I can place the objects at some pose `#o2` on it.  The available actions are `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`. `clean` and `cook` are irrelevant.  I'll need `pick` and `place` actions, using arm `v4`.
           
           Let's start with `v8`. It's currently at `atpose(v8, v9)` and `on(v8, v11)`. My goal is `on(v8, v16)`, which means getting it to `atpose(v8, #o2)`. To do this, I'll `pick` it up from `v9` and then `place` it onto `#o2` on `v16`.
           
           To pick, I need a matching `kin` fact.  I see `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`.  The preconditions for `pick` are, and I need to check:
           *   `kin` (I have it).
           *   `atpose(v8, v9)` (True).
           *   `handempty(v4)` (True, initially).
           *   `atbconf(#o3)` I see initial state `atbconf(v3)`. So, the system *must* instantiate `#o3` with value `v3`, assuming `#o3` denotes the robot's base configuration.  I'm going to follow this *interpretation*.
           *   No unsafe actions
           
           Now, for `place` using kin `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`, and I must satisfy its preconditions:
           *   kin.
           *   `atgrasp(v4, v8, #o1)` (Achieved by pick).
           *   `atbconf(#o3)` to v3 as per my assumption.
           *   No unsafe actions
           
           Now I have to translate the object actions into *actions*. If the continuous parameters are already computed by the TAMP system I should expect to *receive* them, in a way the plan is not constructed in the same manner as in a classical planning problem. I do not see any parameter values. So I need to use the `pick`, `place` action schemas and substitute the parameters and use the kin facts.
           I'll plan the movements in the order: `v8`, `v12`, then `v14`.  I must use the provided objects and continuous parameters.
           
           **My Plan:**
           1.  **`pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4`**:  (Picking `v8` from `v9` where grasp is `#o1` and base configuration is `#o3` which I'm assuming it resolves to the *value* of `v3`, and trajectory is `#o4` which is taken from a `kin` fact.)
               *   Preconditions checked using `kin`.
           2.  **`place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4`**: (Placing `v8` at `#o2` on `v16`)
               *   Preconditions checked using `kin`.
           3.  **`pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4`**: (Picking `v12` from pose `v13`)
               *   Preconditions checked using `kin`.
           4.  **`place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4`**: (Placing `v12` at `#o2`)
               *   Preconditions checked using `kin`.
           5.  **`pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4`**: (Picking `v14` from pose `v15`)
               *   Preconditions checked using `kin`.
           6.  **`place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4`**: (Placing

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Re-Evaluating the Plan's Feasibility**
           
           Okay, the user correctly pointed out the problem: the plan uses `pick` and `place`, but those actions aren't allowed.  Let me think... the goal is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` *on* `v16`.  That translates to `supported(?, ?, v16)` and `atpose(?, ?)`.  I need to check the initial state and see if it's already satisfied, or if I can achieve it with the single allowed action, `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.
           
           Looking at the initial state, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are all supported by `v11` at their respective poses (`v9`, `v13`, and `v15`).  The information also shows where they *could* be: `supported(?, #o2, v16)`.  The goal explicitly needs them supported by `v16`.
           
           The issue is this:  `move_base` *only* changes the robot's base configuration. It doesn't affect the spatial relationships between objects at all!  It doesn't change `atpose`, `supported`, nothing.
           
           The core problem is the action set. To change the `on` relationship, I would need a way to *move* the objects. That, from a planning perspective, demands a `pick` action to grasp an object, and a `place` action to release it in a different position.  I could maybe get around this if objects were already supported on v16, or if there were an intermediate action, but there isn't.
           
           Since I only have `move_base`, and it *can't* manipulate objects or their properties, there's no way to reach the desired state.  They're currently supported by `v11`, not `v16`, and there's no permitted action that can move them. Conclusion: This plan is unachievable given the constraints.
