(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 4) with dimensions (0.098677, 0.098677) on surface 0, an AABB spanning (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  The object is nearly square, and the surface is centered at the origin.
           
           To ensure stability and containment, the object's rotated AABB (depending on the rotation angle) must remain entirely within the surface's AABB.  I've considered rotations of 0, pi/4, and pi/2 radians. Due to the object's near-square shape, rotations of pi/2 result in an almost identical effective AABB to the no-rotation case.  I calculated the effective width and height of the object's AABB after rotations: `W = w * abs(cos(theta)) + h * abs(sin(theta))` and `H = w * abs(sin(theta)) + h * abs(cos(theta))`.
           
           For the case of no rotation (theta = 0), the maximum range for the object's center along x and y is roughly [-0.085, 0.085]. With a pi/4 rotation, the effective AABB is slightly larger so the permissible x and y range becomes  [-0.065, 0.065].
           
           To generate the 50 placements, I'll use a grid-based approach.  I'll allocate:
           
           *   20 placements at 0 degrees, using a 4x5 grid centered in the range [-0.08, 0.08] for both x and y.
           *   20 placements at 90 degrees, using a 4x5 grid centered in the range [-0.08, 0.08] for both x and y.
           *   10 placements at 45 degrees, using a 2x5 grid centered in the range [-0.06, 0.06] for x and y.
           
           The x and y coordinates are:
           x_coords_0 = [-0.07, -0.03, 0.01, 0.05] and y_coords_0 = [-0.07, -0.035, 0, 0.035, 0.07] for rotation=0.
           
           x_coords_90 = [-0.06, -0.02, 0.02, 0.06] and y_coords_90 = [-0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06] for rotation=PI/2.
           
           x_coords_45 = [-0.05, -0.025, 0, 0.025, 0.05] and y_coords_45 = [-0.05, 0.05]
           
           This strategy will generate a varied set of placements across the surface, with differing orientations.

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan for placing this new object (ID: 5) while avoiding the already-placed object (ID: 4). I've got to carefully consider the surface dimensions and the bounding boxes of both objects.
           
           First, I've got the lay of the land: a square surface 0 with dimensions `0.27 x 0.27`, centered at (0,0). Object 5 is almost square with dimensions roughly `0.09417 x 0.09417`. Object 4's data is also known, it's roughly the same size, with dims `0.098677 x 0.098677`.
           
           I've already determined object 4 has been successfully placed at (-0.07, -0.07), axis aligned. To avoid collision, I need to know the 'safe zone'. So, I calculate object 4's bounding box AABB's boundaries:  `[-0.1193385, -0.0206615]` in both X and Y. That part of the surface is occupied and is in the bottom left corner.
           
           Knowing this, I calculate object 5 safe dimensions from the surface dimensions: The center of object 5, when axis aligned, can be within `[-0.087915, 0.087915]` for both X and Y.
           So object 5 cannot go into the bottom left corner because that part of the surface is occupied by object 4.
           For the safe area, I will make sure the object 5 does not occupy the safe zones in which the object center will also collide with object 4, which is roughly `[-0.0879, 0.0264]` for both X and Y. So that would be the bottom-left area.
           
           I am setting a strategy. I am going to focus the placement on safe areas (other three quadrants and along the sides).
           Considering the size, I'm going to start with placements for `theta = 0` (axis aligned). I am calculating a grid-like strategy within the safe areas. The placements should be denser if they are closer to the boundaries, to maximize the variety of options.
           
           Then, I repeat this reasoning and calculations for two other `theta` values.
           For `theta = pi/4` and `theta = pi/2`, I have to take into consideration the effective rotated bounding box. I am using the same strategy.
           
           I have come up with a good distribution of placements across the three different `theta`s. All the places in my grid should avoid collision with the prior object.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out 50 stable locations for Object 6 on Surface 0.  I’ve got two other objects already placed (4 and 5) that I need to avoid bumping into. First, the surface itself is a square with side length 0.27, centered at (0,0).  Object 6 is another square with a side of about 0.073.
           
           I've got the data on Object 4: it's a square about 0.0987 on a side, currently at (-0.07, -0.07) and aligned with the coordinate axes. Its AABB ranges are easy to calculate. Then Object 5, also aligned, is about 0.094 on a side and sits at (0.03, 0.03). This is where things get interesting...
           
           I've got a few things to keep in mind, and the goal is to *maximize stable placements* where I can.  For `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/2`, I have simple bounds: I need the center of Object 6 to fit within the surface boundaries, and I need to avoid the expanded AABBs of Objects 4 and 5. With `theta = pi/4`, I have some slightly different calculations with the square rotated (more space).
           
           The main idea is to use an AABB collision check. If any portion of the box for Object 6 overlaps with Objects 4 or 5, then I've got a collision. I can calculate the expanded regions for the forbidden center points.  It gets a little complicated, but the goal is to make sure I don't collide with these AABBs or the surface bounds when rotating. I'm choosing the axis-aligned placements.
           
           Basically, I can define the safe area on the surface for the object placement. I'm going to start from the overall surface limits then *subtract* the forbidden zones for each placed object.
           
           Let's break this down.
           
           **Safe Zones & Rotation**
           
           For `theta = 0`, I have two distinct safe zones. I can divide the surface into zones not covered by the AABBs.
           
           *   **Zone A (Top-Left):** This has `x < -0.05361`, `y > 0.015865`. For `cx`, I'll use values from `-0.09` to `-0.06`. I use `-0.055` as I can place them just outside `F5`. For the `cy` values, I'll use from `0.02` to `0.06`, so these coordinate pairs for center placement will work.
           
           *   **Zone B (Bottom-Right):** This has `x > 0.015865`, `y < -0.05361`. I want to ensure no collisions, so for `cx` from `0.02` to `0.06`. I can place those, and use `cy` values from `-0.09` to `-0.055`. All good here.
           
           For the `theta = pi/4` placements, I repeat the previous steps.  In this case, I will also use `theta=pi/4` (45-degree angle) and find other free spaces and add more to my 50 points. I had about 6 from the analysis. I can refine this analysis and pick coordinate points around the origin (closer to the origin).
           
           **Final Considerations**
           
           So, with my refined list of `50` points, which is a mix of `theta=0` and `theta = pi/4` to fit all the zones. After I've got these, I can verify with AABB collision.
           
           So, in short, to generate the locations:
           
           1.  I start by using the general surface area that I had with the dimensions of the square object
           2.  Then, I create rectangles that represent forbidden areas where my new object will collide with the older objects.
           3.  I place them in locations that are *not* inside the forbidden rectangles.
           4.  Then, I rotate and repeat the process to get more placements in different zones.
           
           And with this, I will deliver a list of valid placement points.
