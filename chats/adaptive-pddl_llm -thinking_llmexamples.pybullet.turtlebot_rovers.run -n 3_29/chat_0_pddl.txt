           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable with Provided Actions**
           
           My primary objective is to develop a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially requires capturing images and analyzing various rock and soil samples. Expanding on this, the plan needs to satisfy the following requirements: acquire three images, and send analysis of three different stones and three different soil/rock samples.
           
           Analyzing the initial state, I've identified the specific sub-goals: capturing three images identified as receivedimage(v17, v11), receivedimage(v18, v11), and receivedimage(v19, v11), as well as performing and reporting the analysis of three stone samples -receivedanalysis(v3), receivedanalysis(v4), and receivedanalysis(v1)- and also three soil/rock samples -receivedanalysis(v7), receivedanalysis(v8), and receivedanalysis(v5).
           
           To achieve the image-capture sub-goals, I'd need to use the `send_image` action and to get the rock analyses, I would need to use `send_analysis`, which involves `sample_rock`.
           However, a major constraint becomes immediately apparent: I have a list of only four "valid" action instances: move v12 to v13, move v14 to v15, and drop rock for each rover, v12, and v14, which indicates that I need a move and drop_rock action.
           
           My assessment of the continuous parameters is that they need to be treated as implicit mappings from the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates, with `v13` and `v15` as the key parameters for the two rovers. This simplifies the preconditions for the imaging and communication tasks.
           
           Given these constraints and the initial state, I can't generate a plan. To achieve the goals of `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` requires actions (`send_image`, `send_analysis`, `sample_rock`, and actions in support) that are explicitly excluded from the list of valid instances. The valid action instances are two "move" no-ops and two drop_rock actions which depend on the rover's store becoming full, this is something I cannot achieve without `sample_rock`, which I'm not allowed to use. Since I cannot perform actions necessary to meet all the goal conditions with the provided action instances, the goal is unreachable.
