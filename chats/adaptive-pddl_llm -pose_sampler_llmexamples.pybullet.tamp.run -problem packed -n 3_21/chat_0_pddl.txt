           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27. The object is also square, with side length approximately 0.08386.
           
           I need to place the object on surface 0 such that it is fully contained within the surface. Since both the surface and the object are squares, and the object is smaller than the surface, there are many possible stable placements. The object can be placed at various (x, y) coordinates within the surface's bounds, and can be rotated by any angle.
           
           The surface extends from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           The object has a side length of approximately 0.08386.
           
           When placed without rotation (theta=0 or theta=pi/2), the half-width and half-height are 0.08386 / 2 = 0.04193.
           So, the center of the object (x, y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.04193 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.04193
           -0.09307 <= x <= 0.09307
           
           -0.135 + 0.04193 <= y <= 0.135 - 0.04193
           -0.09307 <= y <= 0.09307
           
           If the object is rotated by pi/4 (45 degrees), its diagonal becomes the limiting factor. The half-diagonal is (sqrt(2) * 0.08386) / 2 = 0.05930.
           So, the center of the object (x, y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.05930 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.05930
           -0.07570 <= x <= 0.07570
           
           -0.135 + 0.05930 <= y <= 0.135 - 0.05930
           -0.07570 <= y <= 0.07570
           
           I will generate a diverse set of placements, varying both the position and the orientation.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27.
           I now need to place a new square object (ID: 5) on this surface. The new object has side length approximately 0.098628.
           I also know that object (ID: 6) was successfully placed at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). This means object 6 is centered at the origin with no rotation.
           
           Constraints:
           1. Object 5 must be fully contained within surface 0.
           2. Object 5 must not collide with object 6.
           
           Object 6's AABB:
           Center: (0.0, 0.0)
           Size: (0.08386, 0.08386)
           Min: (-0.04193, -0.04193)
           Max: (0.04193, 0.04193)
           
           Object 5's AABB (unrotated):
           Size: (0.098628, 0.098628)
           Half-size: 0.049314
           
           Surface 0's AABB:
           Min: (-0.135, -0.135)
           Max: (0.135, 0.135)
           
           For object 5 to be contained within surface 0 (without rotation):
           -0.135 + 0.049314 <= x_5 <= 0.135 - 0.049314
           -0.085686 <= x_5 <= 0.085686
           -0.085686 <= y_5 <= 0.085686
           
           To avoid collision with object 6 (centered at (0,0), size 0.08386):
           If object 5 is unrotated, its center (x_5, y_5) must be such that:
           |x_5| > (0.08386/2 + 0.098628/2) = (0.04193 + 0.049314) = 0.091244
           OR
           |y_5| > (0.08386/2 + 0.098628/2) = (0.04193 + 0.049314) = 0.091244
           
           However, the maximum x and y for object 5 is 0.085686. This means if object 5 is unrotated and centered anywhere, it will always collide with object 6, as 0.085686 < 0.091244.
           This implies that object 5 must be placed with a rotation such that its effective bounding box is smaller, or it must be placed such that it just barely touches the edge of object 6's expanded bounds, which given the numerical precision might still be a collision.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the no-collision constraint. The distance between the centers (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) of two axis-aligned rectangles with half-extents (hx1, hy1) and (hx2, hy2) means they collide if:
           |x1 - x2| < (hx1 + hx2) AND |y1 - y2| < (hy1 + hy2)
           
           For object 6 (center (0,0), hx6=0.04193, hy6=0.04193) and object 5 (center (x5,y5), hx5=0.049314, hy5=0.049314 if unrotated):
           Collision if:
           |x5| < (0.04193 + 0.049314) = 0.091244
           AND
           |y5| < (0.04193 + 0.049314) = 0.091244
           
           So, for no collision, we need:
           |x5| >= 0.091244 OR |y5| >= 0.091244
           
           But, for placement within surface 0:
           -0.085686 <= x5 <= 0.085686
           -0.085686 <= y5 <= 0.085686
           
           Since 0.085686 < 0.091244, it's impossible to place unrotated object 5 without collision.
           This means I must use rotation for object 5. When a square object is rotated, its axis-aligned bounding box effectively becomes larger if rotated by angles not multiples of pi/2. The smallest AABB for a square is when theta = k * pi/2. The largest is when theta = (k+0.5) * pi/2, where the AABB side length is sqrt(2) * original_side_length. This is not what happens; for a square object, the AABB extents are actually smallest at 0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2. The AABB extent is largest at pi/4, 3pi/4, etc.
           
           Let's assume the provided object extents are the *actual* x and y dimensions of its AABB *when unrotated*.
           If the object is a square and is rotated, its bounding box will increase. This would make it *harder* to place.
           
           Let me clarify the interpretation of "Object extents (size_x, size_y)". If this refers to the dimensions of the object's body, then rotating it will change its effective AABB. If it refers to the AABB of the object, then it implicitly implies a certain orientation. I'll assume it's the latter for now, but if I keep failing, I'll consider the former interpretation.
           
           If the object is a square with side length 0.098628, its AABB when rotated by an angle theta will have half-extents:
           hx_rotated = 0.5 * (size_x * |cos(theta)| + size_y * |sin(theta)|)
           hy_rotated = 0.5 * (size_x * |sin(theta)| + size_y * |cos(theta)|)
           For a square (size_x = size_y = S):
           hx_rotated = 0.5 * S * (|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|)
           hy_rotated = 0.5 * S * (|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|)
           The maximum value of (|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|) occurs at theta = pi/4, where it's 2 * (sqrt(2)/2) = sqrt(2).
           The minimum value occurs at theta = 0 or pi/2, where it's 1.
           So, the smallest AABB for a square object is when theta = 0 or pi/2, and the largest is when theta = pi/4.
           
           This means my previous reasoning that "rotating it will make it harder to place" holds. I must place object 5 at theta=0 or theta=pi/2 to minimize its AABB and give it the best chance of fitting and avoiding collision.
           
           Let's reconfirm the placement for ID 6. It was at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), which means `theta=0`.
           Object 6 AABB: center (0,0), size (0.08386, 0.08386). Min=(-0.04193, -0.04193), Max=(0.04193, 0.04193).
           
           Object 5 (size 0.098628, 0.098628). If theta=0 or pi/2, half-extents are 0.049314.
           Surface 0 bounds: -0.135 to 0.135.
           
           For object 5 (unrotated) to fit in surface 0:
           x_min_bound = -0.135 + 0.049314 = -0.085686
           x_max_bound = 0.135 - 0.049314 = 0.085686
           So, -0.085686 <= x_5 <= 0.085686 and -0.085686 <= y_5 <= 0.085686.
           
           For object 5 not to collide with object 6:
           |x_5| >= (0.04193 + 0.049314) = 0.091244 OR |y_5| >= (0.04193 + 0.049314) = 0.091244
           
           This is impossible! The maximum absolute coordinate for object 5 is 0.085686, which is less than 0.091244.
           This means that given the current understanding of "object extents" and how AABBs are handled for collision detection, there is no stable placement for object 5 that avoids collision with object 6.
           
           Let's consider the possibility that the problem statement for "object extents" means the physical dimensions of the object, and that collision detection might be based on the actual geometry rather than the axis-aligned bounding box for *rotated* objects. However, the problem explicitly states "x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)". This usually means its AABB in its default, unrotated orientation.
           
           The only way for this to be possible is if the collision detection works differently, or if I misunderstand "stable". If the feedback "placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles" means only fixed obstacles, and objects placed by me are not considered "fixed obstacles" then I might be able to overlap them. But "avoid collision between objects i and j" explicitly states I need to avoid this.
           
           Given the problem constraints, the only possible interpretation is that my initial understanding of the AABB for a rotated object (or the collision check) is wrong, OR that the placement for object 6 was not axis-aligned in the first place, OR that object 6 is NOT an obstacle for object 5. However, the last point contradicts the "avoid collision between objects i and j" rule.
           
           Let's assume the objects themselves are what cause collision, not their current AABBs.
           Object 6 is a square of side 0.08386.
           Object 5 is a square of side 0.098628.
           
           If object 6 is at (0,0) and unrotated, its physical extent is from -0.04193 to 0.04193 in both x and y.
           If object 5 is at (x,y) and unrotated, its physical extent is from x-0.049314 to x+0.049314, and y-0.049314 to y+0.049314.
           
           They collide if their physical extents overlap.
           For no overlap in X: (x-0.049314 > 0.04193) OR (x+0.049314 < -0.04193)
           x > 0.04193 + 0.049314 = 0.091244
           x < -0.04193 - 0.049314 = -0.091244
           So, |x| > 0.091244
           
           For no overlap in Y: |y| > 0.091244
           
           And as before, for object 5 to fit on surface 0:
           -0.085686 <= x_5 <= 0.085686
           -0.085686 <= y_5 <= 0.085686
           
           This still leads to the same conclusion: no valid placement exists if object 5 is unrotated.
           
           Could it be that the success for ID 6 was actually an approximation? No, it's (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), very precise.
           
           What if the problem implies that the "object extents" are for its *smallest* enclosing AABB, and for square objects this means it's always its side length when unrotated? And that the collision detection uses a more complex hull check? This is typically not how "axis-aligned bounding box" is interpreted.
           
           The only way a placement would be possible is if the sum of half-extents is less than the max possible position.
           Sum of half extents = 0.04193 + 0.049314 = 0.091244
           Max extent for object 5 on surface 0 = 0.135 - 0.049314 = 0.085686
           0.091244 > 0.085686. This is the problem.
           
           This means it's literally impossible to place object 5 (unrotated) without colliding with object 6 (unrotated at origin) and staying on the surface.
           This leads me to believe I need to try a *rotated* object 5. But I just reasoned that for a square, rotation makes the AABB *larger*.
           
           Let's re-read carefully: "the geometry of the object will be described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)." This means the given sizes are the effective AABB sizes *for the object's current orientation*.
           If I choose an orientation (theta), then these (size_x, size_y) would *effectively change*.
           But the problem provides a fixed size_x and size_y. This has to mean the extent *when theta = 0*.
           
           Let's assume the problem is solvable and I'm missing something. What if collision is only checked for the 'fixed' obstacles? No, that was clarified: "avoid collision between objects i and j".
           
           Could it be that the provided 'extents' for ID 5 (0.09862815782219125, 0.09862815782219125) are actually slightly smaller, or the 'extents' for ID 6 (0.08386095621932285, 0.08386095621932288) are actually slightly larger, and the numbers are rounded?
           
           Let's use the full precision values for calculations.
           Object 6 size_x = 0.08386095621932285, half_x = 0.041930478109661425
           Object 5 size_x = 0.09862815782219125, half_x = 0.049314078911095625
           
           Sum of half_x = 0.041930478109661425 + 0.049314078911095625 = 0.09124455702075705
           
           Surface bound = 0.135
           Max center for object 5 = 0.135 - 0.049314078911095625 = 0.085685921088904375
           
           Still, 0.09124455702075705 > 0.085685921088904375.
           It is mathematically impossible to place object 5 without collision if both are unrotated.
           
           The only way around this is if a small rotation *does* help, for example, if the collision check is done using circles or something. But the problem says AABB.
           Or perhaps the "extent" refers to the dimensions if the object *were* rotated, i.e., I need to find the correct `theta` such that the *actual* AABB (derived from object's physical dimensions and orientation) would fit.
           
           Let's assume the sizes provided are the *physical dimensions* of the square object, and I need to calculate the AABB for a given rotation.
           If object 6 is a square with side 0.08386095621932285, placed at (0, 0, 0), its AABB is as calculated.
           If object 5 is a square with side 0.09862815782219125, and I rotate it, its AABB *can't get smaller* than its unrotated AABB. It only gets larger (at pi/4 rotation, it's sqrt(2) times larger).
           
           This is a logical dead end. I must be misinterpreting something fundamental.
           Could the "collision" check for my objects not be axis-aligned?
           "avoid collision between objects i and j"
           "geometry of the object will be described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)."
           
           This is tricky. I'll provide placements that are "as far as possible" from object 6's position, pushing object 5 to the edges, with the smallest AABB (unrotated). These will likely fail. I will also try rotating it slightly, although my current reasoning says this will only make it harder.
           
           Let's consider the boundary conditions very strictly.
           For object 5 (ID 5) to fit on surface 0:
           x_center must be in [-0.135 + half_size_x, 0.135 - half_size_x]
           y_center must be in [-0.135 + half_size_y, 0.135 - half_size_y]
           
           For object 5 (ID 5) to not collide with object 6 (ID 6, at (0,0) unrotated):
           |x_center_5 - x_center_6| >= half_size_x_5 + half_size_x_6
           OR
           |y_center_5 - y_center_6| >= half_size_y_5 + half_size_y_6
           
           Using the exact half sizes:
           half_size_x_6 = 0.041930478109661425
           half_size_y_6 = 0.04193047810966144
           
           If object 5 is unrotated:
           half_size_x_5 = 0.049314078911095625
           half_size_y_5 = 0.049314078911095625
           
           Sum of half_sizes_x = 0.09124455702075705
           Sum of half_sizes_y = 0.09124455702075707
           
           Max possible |x_center_5| (for unrotated 5) = 0.135 - 0.049314078911095625 = 0.085685921088904375
           Max possible |y_center_5| (for unrotated 5) = 0.135 - 0.049314078911095625 = 0.085685921088904375
           
           Since 0.085685921088904375 < 0.09124455702075705, there is no placement for object 5 (unrotated) that simultaneously fits on the surface and avoids collision with object 6.
           
           This can only mean two things:
           1. The problem means that the *physical object itself* must fit, and that "axis-aligned bounding box" refers to the *unrotated* configuration. Then, if I rotate the object, its AABB changes. But even with a rotation, the *smallest* AABB for a square is when it's unrotated. A rotated square's AABB will be larger (except for multiples of pi/2). So rotating it makes it harder to fit.
           2. There's a slight error in my calculations/understanding of thresholds, and the actual values just barely allow a placement.
           
           Let's try placing object 5 very close to the edge of the surface, as far as possible from object 6's center.
           I'll try setting the center of object 5 to (0.085685, 0.0) or (0.0, 0.085685) with theta=0 or pi/2. These *should* collide with object 6.
           
           However, the problem requires me to "never give up". I have to provide 50 placements. I will generate them assuming there *is* a solution, and that my understanding of the collision threshold is slightly off or there's a specific numerical property being tested.
           
           I will try to place object 5 as far as possible from object 6's center, along the x and y axes, and in the corners. I will use 0.085 as a max value for positions.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27.
           I need to place a new square object (ID: 4) on this surface. The new object has side length approximately 0.096087.
           
           I have two previously placed objects that act as obstacles:
           - Object 6 (ID: 6) at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Side length: 0.08386095621932285. Half-size: 0.041930478109661425.
             AABB: Min=(-0.041930478, -0.041930478), Max=(0.041930478, 0.041930478).
           - Object 5 (ID: 5) at (0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.0). Side length: 0.09862815782219125. Half-size: 0.049314078911095625.
             AABB: Center=(0.085, 0.0), Half-size=(0.0493140789, 0.0493140789).
             Min=(0.085 - 0.0493140789, -0.0493140789) = (0.0356859211, -0.0493140789)
             Max=(0.085 + 0.0493140789, 0.0493140789) = (0.1343140789, 0.0493140789)
           
           My previous analysis indicated that ID 5 should have collided with ID 6 if placed unrotated at (0.085, 0.0).
           Let's re-check that collision.
           For Object 6: center (0,0), half-size_x = 0.0419304781.
           For Object 5: center (0.085, 0), half-size_x = 0.0493140789.
           
           Distance between centers in x = |0.085 - 0| = 0.085.
           Sum of half-sizes in x = 0.0419304781 + 0.0493140789 = 0.091244557.
           
           Since 0.085 < 0.091244557, these two objects *should* have collided along the X-axis.
           The fact that `(ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.0` was a successful placement means my collision detection logic (based on strict AABB overlap) is either too conservative, or the problem uses a slightly different collision model.
           
           Possibilities:
           1. The collision check has some tolerance.
           2. The `0.085` given for object 5's x-coordinate is an exact number, and it was chosen precisely to just avoid collision, perhaps based on rounding. Let's assume the success implies that `0.085` IS a valid separation. This would mean that the true sum of half-extents is <= 0.085 or the actual check is <= instead of <. Or perhaps it's checked with respect to a different reference.
              If 0.085 is the minimum separation, then it implies that 0.0419304781 + 0.0493140789 = 0.091244557 is actually considered non-colliding if the distance is 0.085. This is a crucial discrepancy.
           
           Let's assume the previous successful placements are the ground truth.
           Object 6: center (0,0), effective size (0.08386, 0.08386)
           Object 5: center (0.085,0), effective size (0.09863, 0.09863)
           
           For the new object (ID: 4):
           Size: 0.09608769076798494. Half-size: 0.04804384538399247.
           Surface 0 bounds: -0.135 to 0.135.
           
           Max x/y for object 4 on surface 0 (unrotated):
           0.135 - 0.04804384538399247 = 0.08695615461600753
           
           Now, checking collision for Object 4 (center (x4,y4), half-size 0.048043845) with Object 6 (center (0,0), half-size 0.041930478):
           No collision if |x4| >= 0.041930478 + 0.048043845 = 0.089974323
           OR |y4| >= 0.041930478 + 0.048043845 = 0.089974323
           
           This means placing object 4 near the origin is impossible without collision.
           0.0869561546 (max fit) < 0.089974323 (min non-collision).
           So, if object 4 is near (0,0), it cannot be placed without colliding with object 6.
           
           Now, checking collision for Object 4 (center (x4,y4), half-size 0.048043845) with Object 5 (center (0.085,0), half-size 0.0493140789):
           No collision if |x4 - 0.085| >= 0.0493140789 + 0.048043845 = 0.0973579239
           OR |y4 - 0| >= 0.0493140789 + 0.048043845 = 0.0973579239
           
           This is also a tight squeeze. The maximum position for x4 is 0.086956.
           If x4 = 0.086956, then |x4 - 0.085| = |0.086956 - 0.085| = 0.001956.
           This is much, much less than 0.0973579239. So object 4 cannot be placed close to object 5's x-coordinate without collision unless its y-coordinate is very far away.
           
           Given the success of placing object 5 at (0.085, 0), which my strict AABB calculation considered a collision, I must adjust my model.
           It's possible that the "collision" check is effectively: `abs(coord1 - coord2) > tolerance + half_size1 + half_size2`.
           Or `abs(coord1 - coord2) >= half_size1 + half_size2`.
           If the latter, then 0.085 >= 0.091244557 is false. So it can't be that.
           
           Let's assume the previous success of object 5 at (0.085, 0.0) means that this specific `x=0.085` value is *just enough* to avoid collision with object 6. This implies that the 'effective' half-width of object 6 (or 5, or both) is smaller, or the distance check is slightly different.
           
           Let `h6_eff` and `h5_eff` be the effective half-sizes for collision.
           For Object 6 (at 0,0) and Object 5 (at 0.085,0), they just barely avoided collision.
           This means `0.085` must be the minimum distance for non-collision on the x-axis.
           `h6_eff + h5_eff <= 0.085`.
           My calculated `h6 + h5 = 0.09124`. This suggests the collision model is not simply sum of half-extents.
           
           What if the surfaces are slightly larger than specified? No, "fully contained within the bounds of the surface".
           What if object extents are actually a little smaller than specified?
           
           Let's work backward from the successful placement of object 5.
           Distance x = 0.085.
           `h6 = 0.04193`.
           If `0.085 > h6 + h5`, then `h5 < 0.085 - h6 = 0.085 - 0.04193 = 0.04307`.
           But `h5` is 0.04931. This is the contradiction.
           
           I have to acknowledge that the actual collision detection logic is not a straightforward sum of half-extents for AABBs as I'm interpreting it.
           Given that `(0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.0)` for object 5 was successful, it means object 5 (center 0.085) and object 6 (center 0) are considered not colliding.
           This means for object 4, I need to find coordinates (x4, y4) such that:
           1. It fits on surface 0:
              |x4| <= 0.135 - 0.048043845 = 0.086956155
              |y4| <= 0.135 - 0.048043845 = 0.086956155
           2. It does not collide with object 6 at (0,0):
              If `0.085` was sufficient to avoid collision for obj5 (half_size=0.04931) with obj6 (half_size=0.04193), this gives us a "rule of thumb".
              Roughly, `distance > 0.085` implies no collision for x-coordinates for these sized objects.
              For obj4 (half_size=0.04804) and obj6 (half_size=0.04193), sum of half-sizes is 0.08997.
              This is very close to 0.09124 that caused the problem for obj5.
           
           Let's assume the previous success means there's a certain "safe zone" of 0.085 away from object 6.
           So, for object 4: |x4| >= 0.085 and |y4| >= 0.085 should be safe from object 6 (or at least, the x and y components are exclusive).
           And we have max |x4| = 0.086956. So this allows placing object 4 at x = 0.086 or -0.086 or y = 0.086 or -0.086.
           
           Now check for collision with Object 5 (at (0.085, 0)).
           Object 4 (half-size 0.04804)
           Object 5 (half-size 0.04931)
           Sum of half-sizes = 0.09735.
           For no collision: |x4 - 0.085| >= 0.09735 OR |y4| >= 0.09735.
           
           If I place object 4 at (x=0.086, y=0.0), then |x4 - 0.085| = |0.086 - 0.085| = 0.001. This is clearly less than 0.09735. So it will collide with object 5.
           This means placing object 4 on the x-axis will collide with either 5 or 6, or both.
           
           The solution must be to place object 4 along the y-axis, far from the x-axis.
           If object 4 is at (0.0, y4), then it might collide with object 6.
           |y4| must be >= 0.085 (from what we infer from obj5's placement success).
           We can place it at y4 = 0.086 or -0.086.
           
           What about collision with object 5 (at (0.085, 0))?
           If object 4 is at (0.0, y4):
           |x4 - 0.085| = |0.0 - 0.085| = 0.085.
           Is 0.085 >= 0.09735? No. So it will collide in x.
           Therefore, it *must* rely on the y-axis separation.
           For y-axis, |y4 - 0| >= 0.09735.
           So, |y4| >= 0.09735.
           
           But the max |y4| for object 4 on the surface is 0.086956.
           This means it is impossible to place object 4 at (0, y4) and avoid collision with object 5.
           This is another dead end with the assumption that the `half_size_sum` rule holds.
           
           This reinforces my suspicion that the collision detection is not simply based on the sum of half-extents. It might be exact 0.0 collision, or it might be based on some non-AABB approach for my placed objects.
           Since ID 5 at (0.085, 0.0) was successful, it seems `0.085` distance from origin (center of ID 6) is considered non-colliding for an object of `0.0986` width.
           ID 4 is `0.09608` width. It is slightly smaller than ID 5.
           If ID 5 fit at 0.085, ID 4 should also fit at 0.085 distance from origin.
           
           Let's assume the safe distance for object 4 from object 6 along an axis is approximately 0.085.
           So, (0.086, 0.0) or (-0.086, 0.0) or (0.0, 0.086) or (0.0, -0.086) should avoid object 6.
           The maximum coordinate for object 4 is 0.086956.
           
           Now, consider collision with object 5 at (0.085, 0.0).
           If object 4 is placed at (-0.086, 0.0).
           Its center is at -0.086. Object 5's center is at 0.085.
           Distance between centers = | -0.086 - 0.085 | = 0.171.
           Sum of half-sizes for 4 and 5 = 0.04804 + 0.04931 = 0.09735.
           Since 0.171 > 0.09735, these two objects will not collide in x.
           Their y-coordinates are both 0.
           Sum of half-sizes for 4 and 5 in y = 0.09735.
           They will collide in y if |y4 - y5| < 0.09735.
           |0 - 0| = 0. So they collide in y if the x-condition is not met.
           But the x-condition *is* met (0.171 > 0.09735). So (-0.086, 0.0) should be a valid placement for object 4.
           
           This finally gives a possible strategy. Place object 4 on the opposite side of object 6 from object 5.
           Specifically, place it at x = -0.086 or a slightly smaller value like -0.08.
           And rotate it to minimize its AABB (theta=0 or pi/2).
