User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Target and Obstacle Placement for Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding three robot base positions near a target point, all within a 2-meter radius, and respecting the arena boundaries and fixed obstacles. The tricky part is the target's location:  it's effectively *inside* a central vertical obstacle.  This means, geometrically, there's no clear "line of sight" possible.  However, I must assume the system expects *something* and will need to provide the best possible solution, given these impossible constraints.
           
           The arena is defined by the outer walls (obstacles 0-4), and the central vertical obstacle (obstacle 5) is the real issue because the target's coordinates place it *inside* of this obstacle. I need to be sure to avoid collisions with any other obstacles.
           
           Given the target's position (-0.019, 1.554), which is just slightly left of the central obstacle (centered at x=0), the most sensible approach is to place the robot on the left side of this obstacle (`x < -0.05`), ensuring I avoid the direct visual obstruction while also keeping the base positions nearby the target. I'll need to choose a safe, negative x-coordinate to ensure no collision with the central wall or any other obstacles. I'm going to set my robot x-positions to be to the left of x = -0.73.
           
           I've decided to fix the x-coordinate at -1.5, placing the robot further left. The next step is to choose the y-coordinates to meet my 2-meter range, and to check for collisions with other fixed obstacles, of which there are several. I have to avoid collisions with obstacle 8 as well as make sure my y-coordinates meet my range requirements.
           
           Finally, I'll pick my three positions within the arena boundaries and within range of the target, and on the correct side of the wall.
           
           Positions:
           - (-1.5000, 1.5540)
           - (-1.5000, 0.2097)
           - (-1.5000, 2.4000)
