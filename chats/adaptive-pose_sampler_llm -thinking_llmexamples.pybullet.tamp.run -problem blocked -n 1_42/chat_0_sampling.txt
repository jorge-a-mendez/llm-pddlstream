(Thoughts: **Placements Summary**
           
           As an expert in this field, I approached this problem methodically.  The task is to find 50 stable placements for a 0.07 x 0.07 object on a rectangular surface.  Stability means the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) *after* rotation must be entirely within the surface's bounds.  I quickly realized the key is understanding how rotation affects the effective AABB. Since the object is square-like, the maximum world-aligned AABB dimensions are achieved at a 45-degree rotation.  After some calculations, I determined the valid ranges for the object's center coordinates (x,y) given a rotation.
           
           My strategy involves generating 50 placements by varying the rotation angle (theta) and the object's (x, y) coordinates. I decided on a set of 5 rotation angles to represent the major differences in bounding boxes (0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, pi/2). For each of the angles, I calculated the new object boundary and found valid (x,y) coordinates where to place it. I then created a spatial grid of positions inside the boundaries of each rotation angle. This will result in 10 unique positions per angle, and with 5 angles, a total of 50 unique placements. This generates a diverse and stable set of solutions, meeting the problem's requirements.  The final result is a list of 50 tuples, each containing the surface index (0), the rotation angle, and the (x, y) coordinates of the object's center.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's get to work on placing this new object!** I've got a valid placement for object ID 5, and I need to figure out where to put object ID 10 on the same surface without them bumping into each other.
           
           First, I need to know the lay of the land. Object 5 is small, roughly 0.07 x 0.07, and its center is at (4.2865, -0.538). That means I can calculate its bounding box – the region it occupies. By adding and subtracting half its dimensions from the center, I've determined that object 5's box stretches from (4.2515, -0.573) to (4.3215, -0.503).
           
           Now for object 10, it's roughly 0.087 x 0.087, so nearly a square too. The challenge is the surface dimensions, it is bounded by ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)). I need to find 50 stable positions for object 10 on this surface, *without* a collision with object 5, and I need to consider it at various rotations, to be thorough.
           
           I start by calculating rotated bounding box dimensions. Since both objects are square, I know that the rotated dimensions are calculated from the unrotated dimensions using `hw * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. I'm going to look at rotations of 0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and pi/2. I can calculate the valid center ranges for x and y for each of these rotations by adjusting the surface bounding box, and also determining `hw_rotated`. For example, at `theta = 0`, the center's x-range is between 4.2435 and 4.7565, and y between -0.5565 and -0.0435. At `theta = pi/4`, it's between 4.2615 and 4.7385 for x, and -0.5385 and -0.0615 for y.
           
           Next, the *key* step! I need to avoid overlap. To avoid a collision, the bounding boxes cannot overlap. I define a collision check based on the AABB (axis-aligned bounding box).  For a given x, y, and theta, if one bounding box max coordinate is less than the min of the other in *any* dimension, then there's no collision. I consider placing object 10 to the *right* of object 5 (`x_center >= 4.365`) or *above* object 5 (`y_center >= -0.4595`).
           
           I've crafted a method to generate a grid of potential centers within the valid ranges for each rotation, then run a collision check against object 5's bounding box. Any point that *doesn't* collide gets added to my list of valid placements. I made sure to test this logic by hand calculations, so the logic is reliable. Also, I am very careful when computing the *exact* ranges.
           
           To ensure I have 50 unique, valid placements, I set up a robust way to generate and evaluate placement configurations and filter those with collisions against the object 5, and also check for uniqueness.
           
           Now, I'll execute the script to find those placements, and ensure I've met the constraints, and generate the *exact* output requested.
