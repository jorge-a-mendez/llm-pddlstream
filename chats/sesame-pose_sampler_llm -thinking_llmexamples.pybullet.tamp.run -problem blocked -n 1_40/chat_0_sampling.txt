(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements for Object ID 5 on a Surface**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. I've got this object, ID 5, a little square with sides of 0.07. The goal is to find 50 stable positions for it on this surface defined by the AABB: `0: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.  "Stable" means the object's body should be within the surface. But since I'm just using AABB extents,  the safest bet is to ensure the *rotated* bounding box stays within the surface.
           
           First, let's nail down what "stable" really means with this square. The *local* AABB of the object is defined at size `0.07`, but when it's rotated, its *global* AABB grows. For a square, the effective size changes only when rotated, and increases with the rotation angle.  At 45 degrees (pi/4), the rotated square AABB is largest: roughly `0.07 * sqrt(2)`, about `0.09899`. So, even if I change the angle, the worst case scenario is it will be `0.09899` wide.
           
           Now, to make sure the object "fits," the object's center has to be far enough from the edges of the surface.  Since I'm considering all angles, let's use the maximum AABB dimension (`0.09899`). I can shift the bounding box by the half-extent, so I need to keep the object center at least `0.0495` from the surface boundary to be sure all the rotations would fit. The usable surface space is 0.6x0.6, leaving space for the object inside.
           
           So, I need to find the usable space by reducing surface bounds by `0.0494975` from each side.
           My plan:
           1.  **Define the valid area for the center:**  Based on `0.09899 / 2`, the center *x* can vary from 4.2494975 to 4.7505025. The *y* is similar: -0.5505025 to -0.0494975.
           2.  **Create a grid for placements:** I'll make a 5x5 grid inside this valid area and choose the (x,y) of the object's center from the grid points.
           3.  **Vary the rotation:** For each grid point, I'll use rotations 0 and pi/4, because for the AABB, these are the only distinct rotated placements that will change the global bounding box.
           
           Let's do some quick calculations. The x and y values for the centers are:
           x_vals = [4.2494975, 4.3747488, 4.5, 4.6252512, 4.7505025]
           y_vals = [-0.5505025, -0.4252512, -0.3, -0.1747488, -0.0494975]
           (These represent coordinates for the object's center.)
           
           The angle values:
           thetas = [0.0, 0.7853981633974483]
           (0.0, and pi/4 in radians)
           
           Using the full precision coordinates, the Python generated list will be (using surf_idx = 0):
           `[(0, 0.0, 4.2494975, -0.5505025), (0, 0.7853981633974483, 4.2494975, -0.5505025), (0, 0.0, 4.37474875, -0.5505025), (0, 0.7853981633974483, 4.37474875, -0.5505025), (0, 0.0, 4.5, -0.5505025), (0, 0.7853981633974483,

(Thoughts: **Recalibrating Placement Logic for Stability and Collision Avoidance**
           
           After reviewing the feedback on Object ID 5's placements, I've identified that the simulator's stability check for rotated objects is more stringent than my initial calculations. The key issue lies in ensuring the object's Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) remains fully within the surface's AABB, especially after rotation.
           
           I've re-evaluated the AABB calculation for a rotated square object.  For an object with dimensions (size_x, size_y), I can derive the half-extents (h_x, h_y). When rotated by an angle θ, the new AABB half-extents (H_x, H_y) are computed using the absolute values of cosine and sine of the angle and the initial half extents. The calculations appear correct, with my understanding matching the simulator's. However, it seems the precise containment check requires a tighter tolerance.
           
           By checking the failed placements, I noticed that slight inaccuracies in floating-point precision can lead to the object’s lower bounds being calculated *just* outside of the surface bounds. To rectify this, I need to introduce a small, but positive `epsilon` value (e.g., 1e-7) when calculating the valid center range. This ensures that the object’s AABB always remains safely within the surface's AABB, accounting for possible floating-point rounding errors. This `epsilon` value will be added to my calculated center position when determining the valid center.
           
           Now, considering the requirement to avoid collisions with previously placed objects (ID 5), I need to calculate a new valid range for centers, taking into account the footprint of these previously placed objects. Analyzing the current ID 5 placements, I determined the region they occupy. Then, to place a new object (ID 10), I must confine its center to an area that does not overlap with any of ID 5's AABB.
           
           For ID 10, given object size information, I can calculate its half-extents and maximum bounding box given any possible rotation, in this case, a conservative estimate of the longest possible diagonal. Now, knowing the occupied region of object ID 5, and with the added `epsilon`, I can calculate safe ranges for the placement centers that will ensure stability on the surface while avoiding any collision with the pre-existing object.
           
           With these refined calculations, specifically for both collision avoidance and object stability, I will re-generate the placement grid points for object ID 10. The plan is to create a 5x5 grid and provide two orientations (0 and pi/4), resulting in 50 placements in total.  This strategy will ensure stable placements and no collisions while utilizing existing geometry to improve coverage and reliability.
