(Thoughts: **Generating Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, so I need to find three valid robot base positions near the target point `(2.13, -1.91)`. They must be within a 2-unit radius, and I'll automatically set the robot's orientation towards the target. The main challenge is avoiding collisions with those fixed obstacles and ensuring a clear line of sight to the target. I've got a list of AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) shapes to work with, and the global scene limits are `x: [-2.5, 2.5]` and `y: [-2.5, 2.5]`.
           
           First, I defined the search area. Given the target, the 2-unit radius defines a circular region. However, the global boundaries mean I effectively have to work within a rectangular region, roughly `[0.13, 2.5]` for x and `[-2.5, 0.09]` for y.
           
           Next, I analyzed the obstacles. I noticed the outer bounds are irrelevant, as they simply reinforce the global x/y limits. There's a central vertical wall at `x=0.05`. Since my target is on the right side of this wall, any valid base position must also be to the right of this, i.e., `x > 0.05`. Then, there's a smaller obstacle `((0.33, -0.81), (0.47, -0.67))` that's within my effective search area.
           
           The plan is to select three diverse positions around the target. Diversity is key! I'll consider polar coordinates centered on the target to generate these.
           
           For the first position, I'm thinking directly "above" the target at `(2.13, -0.41)`. This has a distance of 1.5, well within the 2-unit range. It's also clear of obstacles and in the right half.
           
           For the second position, directly "to the right", I'll use `(2.5, -1.91)`. This is at the right edge of the environment, a distance of 0.37 from the target, and also safe from collisions.
           
           Third, I need a position more "left". I'll calculate `(0.63, -1.91)`. At a distance of 1.5. This seems to work well, and it's free of collisions. All three have a clear line of sight. Given the lack of any additional information about dynamic or unknown obstacles, these points look solid.
           
           I’m confident these three points are a good starting point to generate a valid solution for the target request.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating Placement Strategies for Target `(2.13, -1.91)`**
           
           I've carefully reviewed the feedback, realizing a key misstep was a previous misunderstanding of the target location. The feedback was for a *different* target.  Now, focusing on the *correct* target `(2.13, -1.91)`,  I've thoroughly re-evaluated my approach.  My analysis of previous failures highlighted the critical importance of precisely respecting the environment's boundaries. The "global bounds" provided actually *include* the boundary walls, so I must consider the effective usable space to be a bit smaller.  I've now corrected this in my reasoning. Furthermore, I've re-confirmed that obstacle 14 won't obstruct line-of-sight from positions near this particular target.
           
           My revised strategy for generating placement suggestions is informed by the feedback and refined constraints: I'm meticulously considering the global bounds and the 2-unit maximum distance from the target. From the refined understanding of boundaries, I have now confirmed that my search box is `x=[0.13, 2.4], y=[-2.4, 0.09]`. I'm now certain about my constraints and the correct boundary walls. With this in mind, I've generated three promising candidate positions: `(2.13, -0.41)`, `(0.63, -1.91)`, and `(2.4, -2.0)`.
           
           These positions are designed to give diverse coverage and should all meet the valid placement requirements. They have been validated against the boundary constraints and obstacle 14.

(Thoughts: **A Deep Dive into Target Acquisition and Obstacle Avoidance**
           
           Okay, so the challenge is to find three robot base positions for a new target located at (0.61, 1.91). I need to navigate the feedback from past failures and the current environment. My initial step is to identify and isolate the new target from previous target coordinates. It's crucial to accurately interpret the system feedback, which has some noise between previous and new target feedback.
           
           The system's feedback reveals three main failures:
           1.  Collision with a boundary at (2.4, -2.0). I'll need to stay clear of that boundary with any potential robot positions.
           2.  No line-of-sight from (2.13, -0.41) and (0.63, -1.91) to the current target.
           3.  Obstacle collision.
           
           I start by building a picture of the current obstacle landscape:
           *   Boundaries are the effective limits (`x` and `y` between -2.4 and 2.4).
           *   The central wall (`x` around 0) and the other obstacles (boxes 11 and 21) are key.
           *   Obstacle 9 (`(0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)`) contains the target at (0.61, 1.91) This is a crucial finding!
           
           With this in mind, the key challenges are:
           *   **Target Point Inside Obstacle 9**: The target point is embedded in a box obstacle, obstacle 9.
           *   **Obstacle 21 is a problem**: Since the target is right next to a box obstacle at `((0.570, 1.871), (0.642, 1.944))`.
           *   **Central Wall**: This one must be avoided in the `x` dimension.
           
           I am operating under the constraint that I must suggest positions, even though line-of-sight will not be possible given this situation.
           
           Using this information, I propose three base positions. They all have the following characteristics:
           *   No collision with fixed obstacles
           *   Within the 2-unit range
           *   Within bounds
           These three positions are designed to be as geometrically valid as possible, knowing the constraints mean that a "line-of-sight" is unlikely.
           
           1.  **(0.606, 0.407)**: Directly below the target to maximize horizontal line of sight possibility if any.
           2.  **(0.1, 1.907)**:  Directly left of the target, with an angle to the target.
           3.  **(2.106, 1.907)**: Directly right of target, with an angle to the target.
