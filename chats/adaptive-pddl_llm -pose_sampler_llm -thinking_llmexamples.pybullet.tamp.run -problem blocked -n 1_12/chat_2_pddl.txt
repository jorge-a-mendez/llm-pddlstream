           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Plan for new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get something of type `v17` *on* `v18`. Looking at the axioms, that boils down to finding an object, let's call it `?green`, and getting it on top of `v18` (`on(?green, v18)`) and ensuring it's of the right type (`type(?green, v17)`).
           
           I see two objects that fit the type requirement initially: `v12` and `v8`. I'll start with `v12`. To make `v12` *on* `v18`, it needs to be *supported* by `v18` and *at* a particular pose.  Good, the initial state shows `v12` *is* already supported at `#o2` by `v18` which is exactly the pose I need.
           
           Currently, `v12` is at pose `v13`. So, I need to pick it up from there and then place it at `#o2`.
           
           The robot has two arms. Let's use `v4`. It's currently empty, and I've got a way to control the base as well as the arms to navigate and pick up things.
           
           To pick `v12` up, I need to move the base to be at configuration `#o3` (which is needed for picking up and placing).  Then, the `pick` action will require me to move the base (a move_base function), pick up the object by passing parameters like the arm, the object, the current pose, grasp point and final pose, and I need to place the object onto the designated pose.
           
           Okay, checking the preconditions for `pick`, I need to make sure the robot can move to `#o3`,  the arm is empty, and there are no safety concerns. I have to make sure I am at the desired configuration, `#o3`, for both actions. I see the needed `basemotion` in the current state, so I'll first use `move_base(v3, #o3, #o0)`.
           
           Now, with the base in position, I perform the first action, `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)`. Once that's done, `v12` will be in arm `v4`.
           
           Finally, I can use `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` to put `v12` at the target pose, `#o2`, which will fulfill the goal. All the `canmove()` conditions look consistent in the actions.
           
           This plan successfully makes `v12` *on* `v18` and `v12` is of the correct type (`v17`) so the overall goal is satisfied. The process to ensure *on* is achieved by the base move, then pick and place. Now, I will double check, but the plan looks sound.
