(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object 10 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for an object (ID 10) with dimensions approximately 0.0945 x 0.0945 on a rectangular surface (Surface 0).  The surface's extents are defined by ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)), where the latter are `(max_x, max_y)`.
           
           A stable placement, defined as (surf_idx, theta, x, y), requires that the object's bottom edge (when unrotated) rests at the `surface_max_y`. The x, y coordinates represent the center of the object's AABB.
           
           To determine stable placement, I need to know:
           1.  The `y` coordinate for the center of the object should be equal to the `surface_max_y` plus half the effective AABB `sy` dimension.
           
           2.  Rotate object's AABB by calculating its effective bounding box:
               - effective_sx = |obj_sx * cos(theta)| + |obj_sy * sin(theta)|
               - effective_sy = |obj_sx * sin(theta)| + |obj_sy * cos(theta)|
               - Since obj_sx and obj_sy are very close, these dimensions are similar and depend on the theta.
           
           3.  The acceptable `x` positions are determined by the equation for the center:
               - `center_x = min_x + effective_sx / 2` to `max_x - effective_sx / 2`
           
           Given the nearly-square shape and the size of the object relative to the surface, placements are easy to find. I've designed an algorithm that generates 50 placements as follows:
           
           1.  I iterate through 10 `theta` values equally spaced from 0 to pi/2 (to obtain a good variety of object orientations).
           
           2.  I generate 5 equally spaced values between the calculated minimum and maximum positions to get 5 x positions for each value of `theta`.
           
           3.  With surface_idx 0, a calculated y coordinate, x coordinate and theta, I have a stable, non-colliding object within the constraints defined.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were placements that collided with fixed obstacles or that were not stable. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Understanding and Correcting Object Placement**
           
           I've been wrestling with how to get these object placements stable and contained within their designated surfaces. The system keeps flagging them as unstable, and I've finally cracked the code, I think. The key seems to be a significant difference between the object's stated "extents" and its *actual* effective collision geometry, as observed through the feedback.
           
           Initially, I thought the `(x, y)` coordinate in the placement output referred to the object's center. I was calculating the `y` position to have the object's bottom edge aligned with the surface's top edge. While this should have worked, it turns out the feedback tells a different story. The crucial piece of information is the reported object AABB's dimensions during a failed placement. The system's calculated values consistently suggest an object AABB is `0.07 x 0.07`. This means, the actual dimensions used in collision calculations differ from the stated `size_x` and `size_y` extents.
           
           The feedback's crucial message "the AABB of the object (...) is not contained in the AABB of the surface" clarified the issue. To meet this stability requirement, the object's *upper* bound must be equal to or *below* the surface's upper bound. Initially, I was placing it directly on the surface top, assuming the feedback was incorrect. However, it seems the intended state is that the volume must be fully within, and not resting *on* the surface.
           
           Therefore, for this particular surface (with a top y-value of 0.0), the object's center `y` coordinate must be *below* 0.0. The math is relatively simple: With the understanding of an effective object width of `0.07`, the y-center should be `0.0 - 0.07 / 2 = -0.035` and the top should hit `0.0`.
           
           This approach ensures the object's AABB is wholly contained by the surface and guarantees a stable, valid placement according to the feedback. Even with rotations included, I'll rely on these effective dimensions. Therefore, I will create 50 valid placements with this new understanding, and they should all pass stability.
