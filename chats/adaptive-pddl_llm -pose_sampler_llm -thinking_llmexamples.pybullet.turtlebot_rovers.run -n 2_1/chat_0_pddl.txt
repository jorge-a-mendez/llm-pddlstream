User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning for Robot Base Placement**
           
           My task is to find three valid (x, y) robot base positions for a given target point, ensuring they're within a maximum range of 2 from the target and within the environment's boundaries ([-2.5, 2.5] for both x and y). I'm given a set of fixed obstacles, which I must avoid. Since this is the first request for this target, I only need to consider these fixed obstacles.
           
           Here's my approach:
           
           1.  **Candidate Generation:** I start by generating candidate positions around the target point. I use a mix of structured and random sampling. The structured part involves generating points in concentric circles around the target, varying the radius and angle. To ensure coverage and diversity, I also add a fallback of random points within the allowed range.
           2.  **Obstacle and Boundary Checks:** For each candidate position, I perform two crucial checks:
           
               *   **Collision Detection:** I check if the candidate robot base position is inside an obstacle AABB.
               *   **Line-of-Sight/Occlusion Check:** This is the most crucial part. I perform a ray-AABB intersection test for each obstacle. If any obstacle lies along the direct line between the robot and the target, it means there's an occlusion, and that position is invalid.
           
           3.  **Ensuring Diversity:** To make sure I find good solutions, I employ methods that favor diverse solutions. The initial structured search, combined with random sampling, helps explore different areas. I also ensure that the found solutions aren't too close to each other. I'll add a small jitter to found positions to also make sure I have diverse solutions.
           
           This approach will help me to robustly find base positions that are both valid (collision-free, in-bounds) and offer good line-of-sight to the target, prioritizing diversity among the solutions.
