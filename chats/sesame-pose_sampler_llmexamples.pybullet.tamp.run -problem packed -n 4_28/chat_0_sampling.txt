           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single square surface centered at the origin, with extents from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. The object is a square with side length 0.09757698175246765.
           
           To find stable placements, I need to ensure the object is fully contained within the surface. Since the object is square, its bounding box dimensions are the same regardless of rotation. The surface is also square.
           
           The half-width of the surface is 0.135. The half-width of the object is 0.09757698175246765 / 2 = 0.048788490876233825.
           For the object to be entirely on the surface, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.048788490876233825 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.048788490876233825
           -0.135 + 0.048788490876233825 <= y <= 0.135 - 0.048788490876233825
           
           This simplifies to:
           -0.086211509123766175 <= x <= 0.086211509123766175
           -0.086211509123766175 <= y <= 0.086211509123766175
           
           I will generate 50 placements by varying the x and y coordinates within these bounds and trying different rotations, although for a square object on a square surface, rotation doesn't change the footprint. I'll stick to surface 0.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene remains the same: a single square surface centered at the origin, with extents from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           The new object (ID: 4) is also a square with side length 0.09617712137746415.
           The half-width of the surface is 0.135. The half-width of the object (ID: 4) is 0.09617712137746415 / 2 = 0.048088560688732075.
           For object (ID: 4) to be entirely on the surface, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.048088560688732075 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.048088560688732075
           -0.135 + 0.048088560688732075 <= y <= 0.135 - 0.048088560688732075
           
           This simplifies to:
           -0.086911439311267925 <= x <= 0.086911439311267925
           -0.086911439311267925 <= y <= 0.086911439311267925
           
           I also need to consider the previously placed object (ID: 5) at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Its half-width is 0.048788490876233825.
           To avoid collision between object 4 and object 5, the distance between their centers must be greater than or equal to the sum of their half-widths if they are axis-aligned.
           Let (x4, y4) be the center of object 4, and (x5, y5) be the center of object 5 (0,0).
           Let hw4 be the half-width of object 4 (0.048088560688732075).
           Let hw5 be the half-width of object 5 (0.048788490876233825).
           The sum of their half-widths is 0.048088560688732075 + 0.048788490876233825 = 0.0968770515649659.
           If they are axis-aligned, then |x4 - x5| >= hw4 + hw5 OR |y4 - y5| >= hw4 + hw5.
           Since x5=0 and y5=0, this means |x4| >= 0.0968770515649659 OR |y4| >= 0.0968770515649659.
           
           However, the maximum x and y coordinates allowed for object 4 are 0.086911439311267925. This is less than 0.0968770515649659. This means that if object 5 is at (0,0) and both objects are axis-aligned, there is no stable placement for object 4 on surface 0 without colliding with object 5, assuming axis-aligned bounding box collision for simplicity.
           But, object 5's original placement being (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) means it was placed at (x=0, y=0) with an angle of 0 radians. The placement of object 5 refers to its centroid.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the collision condition. The objects are square. The tightest packing would be with no rotation (angle = 0).
           The range for object 4 is [-0.0869, 0.0869]. The center of object 5 is at (0,0).
           The x-range of object 5 is [-0.048788, 0.048788].
           The y-range of object 5 is [-0.048788, 0.048788].
           
           If object 4 is at (x4, y4) with half-width hw4, its x-range is [x4-hw4, x4+hw4] and y-range is [y4-hw4, y4+hw4].
           Collision occurs if their bounding boxes overlap.
           [x4-hw4, x4+hw4] overlaps with [-hw5, hw5] AND [y4-hw4, y4+hw4] overlaps with [-hw5, hw5].
           
           Since the maximum allowed x for object 4 is 0.0869, its x-range would be [0.0869 - 0.0480, 0.0869 + 0.0480] = [0.0389, 0.1349]. This overlaps with [-0.0487, 0.0487] in x.
           Similarly, if x4 is 0.0869, then x4-hw4 is 0.03882287862253585. This range [0.0388, 0.1349] does not overlap with [-0.0487, 0.0487].
           This implies that if the x-coordinate of the center of object 4 is outside the range [- (hw4 + hw5), (hw4 + hw5)], then there is no x-overlap.
           hw4 + hw5 = 0.048088560688732075 + 0.048788490876233825 = 0.0968770515649659.
           
           So, if |x4| >= 0.0968770515649659 OR |y4| >= 0.0968770515649659, then the objects will not collide if they are axis aligned.
           However, the maximum absolute value for x and y coordinates for object 4 is 0.086911439311267925.
           This means that any valid placement for object 4 on the surface will result in a collision with object 5 if they are both axis-aligned.
           
           This suggests that I need to either:
           1. Place object 4 with a rotation such that its effective bounding box is smaller in some direction, allowing it to fit. However, for a square, the AABB is the same for any multiple of pi/2 rotation. For other rotations, the AABB will be larger (corners extending further). So, this approach is not useful for a square.
           2. Consider that the collision check for objects is more precise than AABB and allows for corner-to-corner fitting, or my previous reasoning about what 'stable' implies for fixed obstacles and what 'collision' means for other objects is different.
           3. The problem statement says "if a placement fails multiple times, it is likely that there is a collision that you are not aware of". In this case, I'm aware of the collision based on AABBs.
           
           Given that I must always provide a placement, and my AABB analysis suggests collision is unavoidable, I will proceed by placing object 4 as far as possible from the origin (where object 5 is centered), to minimize overlap, and hope that the actual collision detection is more permissive or that my AABB reasoning is too conservative. I will try the corners of the allowed region for object 4. I will still generate 50 placements.

           For object (ID: 7) to be entirely on the surface, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.037253790081839375 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.037253790081839375
           -0.135 + 0.037253790081839375 <= y <= 0.135 - 0.037253790081839375
           
           This simplifies to:
           -0.09774620991816062 <= x <= 0.09774620991816062
           -0.09774620991816062 <= y <= 0.09774620991816062
           
           I need to avoid collisions with previously placed objects:
           - Object (ID: 5) at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) with half-width 0.048788490876233825.
           - Object (ID: 4) at (0, 0.0, 0.086, 0.086) with half-width 0.048088560688732075.
           
           Let's check potential collision with object 5 (center (0,0), hw5=0.048788490876233825):
           Sum of half-widths for 7 and 5: hw7 + hw5 = 0.037253790081839375 + 0.048788490876233825 = 0.0860422809580732.
           For no collision, |x7| >= 0.0860422809580732 OR |y7| >= 0.0860422809580732.
           The allowed range for x7, y7 is [-0.0977, 0.0977]. This means there's a good chance to place object 7 without colliding with object 5. For example, placing it at (0.09, 0) should work.
           
           Let's check potential collision with object 4 (center (0.086, 0.086), hw4=0.048088560688732075):
           Sum of half-widths for 7 and 4: hw7 + hw4 = 0.037253790081839375 + 0.048088560688732075 = 0.08534235077057145.
           Let (x7, y7) be the center of object 7. (x4, y4) = (0.086, 0.086).
           For no collision, |x7 - x4| >= hw7 + hw4 OR |y7 - y4| >= hw7 + hw4.
           So, |x7 - 0.086| >= 0.08534235077057145 OR |y7 - 0.086| >= 0.08534235077057145.
           
           This means object 7's center x7 must be <= 0.086 - 0.0853... = 0.00065764922942855 OR >= 0.086 + 0.0853... = 0.17134235077057145. The latter is out of bounds for object 7.
           So, x7 <= 0.00065764922942855.
           Similarly, y7 <= 0.00065764922942855.
           
           This implies that object 7 must be placed roughly in the lower-left quadrant relative to object 4 (and very close to the x=0, y=0 lines), and also satisfy the non-collision condition with object 5.
           
           Let's try to place object 7 in a region that avoids both.
           A possible strategy is to place it in the negative x, negative y quadrant relative to the origin. For example, (-0.09, -0.09).
           This placement (-0.09, -0.09) is within the allowed bounds [-0.0977, 0.0977].
           Check collision with object 5 (center (0,0)):
           |x7| = 0.09 >= 0.08604 (No collision in x)
           |y7| = 0.09 >= 0.08604 (No collision in y)
           Since both x and y distances are greater than the sum of half-widths, there is no collision with object 5.
           
           Check collision with object 4 (center (0.086, 0.086)):
           |x7 - x4| = |-0.09 - 0.086| = |-0.176| = 0.176. This is >= 0.08534. (No collision in x)
           Since there is no collision in x, there is no collision with object 4.
           
           So, a placement like (0, 0.0, -0.09, -0.09) should be stable and avoid both previously placed objects. I will generate 50 placements around this strategy.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene is still a single square surface from -0.135 to 0.135.
           The new object (ID: 6) is a square with side length 0.08153291852401451.
           The half-width of object (ID: 6) is 0.08153291852401451 / 2 = 0.040766459262007255.
           For object (ID: 6) to be entirely on the surface, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.040766459262007255 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.040766459262007255
           -0.135 + 0.040766459262007255 <= y <= 0.135 - 0.040766459262007255
           
           This simplifies to:
           -0.09423354073799274 <= x <= 0.09423354073799274
           -0.09423354073799274 <= y <= 0.09423354073799274
           
           I need to avoid collisions with previously placed objects:
           - Object (ID: 5) at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) with half-width hw5 = 0.048788490876233825.
           - Object (ID: 4) at (0, 0.0, 0.086, 0.086) with half-width hw4 = 0.048088560688732075.
           - Object (ID: 7) at (0, 0.0, -0.09, -0.09) with half-width hw7 = 0.037253790081839375.
           
           Let hw6 be the half-width of object 6 (0.040766459262007255).
           
           Check collision with object 5 (center (0,0)):
           Sum of half-widths for 6 and 5: hw6 + hw5 = 0.040766459262007255 + 0.048788490876233825 = 0.08955495013824108.
           For no collision, |x6| >= 0.08955495013824108 OR |y6| >= 0.08955495013824108.
           The allowed range for x6, y6 is [-0.0942, 0.0942]. This leaves a small margin for non-collision with object 5. For example, (0.09, 0) or (0, 0.09) would potentially work.
           
           Check collision with object 4 (center (0.086, 0.086)):
           Sum of half-widths for 6 and 4: hw6 + hw4 = 0.040766459262007255 + 0.048088560688732075 = 0.08885501995073933.
           For no collision, |x6 - 0.086| >= 0.08885501995073933 OR |y6 - 0.086| >= 0.08885501995073933.
           This means x6 must be <= 0.086 - 0.0888... = -0.00285501995073933 OR >= 0.086 + 0.0888... = 0.17485501995073933. (The latter is out of bounds for object 6).
           So, x6 <= -0.00285501995073933. Similarly, y6 <= -0.00285501995073933.
           
           Check collision with object 7 (center (-0.09, -0.09)):
           Sum of half-widths for 6 and 7: hw6 + hw7 = 0.040766459262007255 + 0.037253790081839375 = 0.07802024934384663.
           For no collision, |x6 - (-0.09)| >= 0.07802024934384663 OR |y6 - (-0.09)| >= 0.07802024934384663.
           So, |x6 + 0.09| >= 0.07802024934384663 OR |y6 + 0.09| >= 0.07802024934384663.
           This means x6 must be <= -0.09 - 0.078... = -0.16802... (out of bounds) OR >= -0.09 + 0.078... = -0.01197975065615337.
           So, x6 >= -0.01197975065615337. Similarly, y6 >= -0.01197975065615337.
           
           Combining the constraints:
           From object 4: x6 <= -0.00285 and y6 <= -0.00285.
           From object 7: x6 >= -0.01198 and y6 >= -0.01198.
           This defines a very small rectangular region for the center of object 6:
           x6 in [-0.01198, -0.00285]
           y6 in [-0.01198, -0.00285]
           This region is also within the overall surface bounds [-0.0942, 0.0942].
           
           Let's pick a point in this region, e.g., (-0.007, -0.007).
           Check against object 5 (center (0,0)):
           |x6|=0.007, which is NOT >= 0.08955. And |y6|=0.007, which is NOT >= 0.08955.
           This means that placing object 6 in this small region that avoids objects 4 and 7 will collide with object 5!
           
           This is a tight packing scenario. Given the existing placements:
           - Object 5: (0,0), half-width ~0.0488
           - Object 4: (0.086, 0.086), half-width ~0.0481
           - Object 7: (-0.09, -0.09), half-width ~0.0373
           
           The available space seems very limited.
           Maximum allowed x, y for obj 6 is ~0.0942.
           The corners of the surface area are being occupied by objects 4 and 7, and object 5 is in the center.
           
           Let's consider quadrants.
           Quadrant 1 (x>0, y>0): Object 4 is here, (0.086, 0.086). Its half-width is 0.0481. Its bounding box is [0.0379, 0.1341] x [0.0379, 0.1341].
           Quadrant 3 (x<0, y<0): Object 7 is here, (-0.09, -0.09). Its half-width is 0.0373. Its bounding box is [-0.1273, -0.0527] x [-0.1273, -0.0527].
           Center (x=0,y=0): Object 5 is here. Its half-width is 0.0488. Its bounding box is [-0.0488, 0.0488] x [-0.0488, 0.0488].
           
           Remaining 'open' regions:
           - Quadrant 2 (x<0, y>0): This is the upper-left. Need to avoid O5 and O7.
             For O6 to not collide with O5 (center (0,0)): |x6| >= 0.08955 OR |y6| >= 0.08955.
             For O6 to not collide with O7 (center (-0.09, -0.09)): |x6 + 0.09| >= 0.07802 OR |y6 + 0.09| >= 0.07802.
             If we target x6 < 0 and y6 > 0:
             From O5: x6 <= -0.08955 OR y6 >= 0.08955.
             From O7: (x6 + 0.09 >= 0.07802 => x6 >= -0.01198) OR (y6 + 0.09 >= 0.07802 => y6 >= -0.01198).
             This doesn't fully make sense, as O7 is in a different quadrant. The axis-aligned condition is just that the x-intervals don't overlap OR the y-intervals don't overlap.
             O7 x-interval: [-0.1273, -0.0527]
             O7 y-interval: [-0.1273, -0.0527]
           
           Let's try a placement for Object 6 (hw6=0.040766) in the upper-left corner (negative x, positive y).
           Max coords are -0.0942 and 0.0942.
           Try (x6, y6) = (-0.094, 0.094). This is valid for surface 0.
           
           Check vs Object 5 (center (0,0), hw5=0.0488):
           x-overlap: range of O6 is [-0.094-0.0408, -0.094+0.0408] = [-0.1348, -0.0532]. This does not overlap with O5's x-range [-0.0488, 0.0488]. No collision with O5.
           
           Check vs Object 4 (center (0.086, 0.086), hw4=0.0481):
           x-overlap: O6 x-range [-0.1348, -0.0532]. O4 x-range [0.0379, 0.1341]. No x-overlap. No collision with O4.
           
           Check vs Object 7 (center (-0.09, -0.09), hw7=0.0373):
           x-overlap: O6 x-range [-0.1348, -0.0532]. O7 x-range [-0.1273, -0.0527]. There IS x-overlap here.
             Lower bound of O6: -0.1348. Upper bound of O6: -0.0532.
             Lower bound of O7: -0.1273. Upper bound of O7: -0.0527.
             Overlap exists: [-0.1273, -0.0527] (intersection).
           y-overlap: O6 y-range [0.094-0.0408, 0.094+0.0408] = [0.0532, 0.1348].
             O7 y-range [-0.1273, -0.0527]. No y-overlap. No collision with O7.
           
           It seems (-0.094, 0.094) works.
           Let's try another placement for object 6, e.g., in the lower-right quadrant (positive x, negative y).
           Try (x6, y6) = (0.094, -0.094).
           
           Check vs Object 5 (center (0,0), hw5=0.0488):
           x-overlap: O6 x-range [0.0532, 0.1348]. No overlap with O5 x-range [-0.0488, 0.0488]. No collision with O5.
           
           Check vs Object 4 (center (0.086, 0.086), hw4=0.0481):
           x-overlap: O6 x-range [0.0532, 0.1348]. O4 x-range [0.0379, 0.1341]. Overlap in x: [0.0532, 0.1341].
           y-overlap: O6 y-range [-0.1348, -0.0532]. O4 y-range [0.0379, 0.1341]. No y-overlap. No collision with O4.
           
           Check vs Object 7 (center (-0.09, -0.09), hw7=0.0373):
           x-overlap: O6 x-range [0.0532, 0.1348]. O7 x-range [-0.1273, -0.0527]. No x-overlap. No collision with O7.
           
           So, both (-0.094, 0.094) and (0.094, -0.094) should be valid. I'll use these and variations.
