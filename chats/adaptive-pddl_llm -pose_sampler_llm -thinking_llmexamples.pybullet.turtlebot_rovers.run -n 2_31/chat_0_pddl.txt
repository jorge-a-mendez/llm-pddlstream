           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Feasibility of new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with figuring out a plan to achieve this `new-axiom@0()` goal. Breaking it down, it's essentially a conjunction of several conditions. My first step is to analyze each condition and its initial state. It looks like the core of this goal revolves around getting images and analysis of both rocks and soil.
           
           The goal explicitly needs `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates to be true. To achieve these, I need to get images using `send_image` and analysis using `send_analysis`. However, the available actions are severely limited. I'm only given two `move` actions (which do nothing) and two `drop_rock` actions. None of these actions directly affect the predicates I need to achieve.
           
           Looking at the preconditions for the actions I *could* use, such as `send_image`, `take_image`, and `send_analysis`, I need several other predicates to be true, like `comvisible`, `imagevisible`, `haveimage`, and `analyzed`.  To achieve `haveimage`, I would need to perform `take_image` which in turn requires `calibrated`. Similarly, `analyzed` needs `sample_rock`. But, crucially, none of the actions required to set up these conditions (such as `take_image` or `sample_rock`) are included in the given list of valid action instances.
           
           The "valid action instances" constraint is key here. It dictates I can only use the listed actions, and that means I can't generate action instances, even if their preconditions are met. So, I must conclude the goal is **unachievable**. The provided actions simply don't have the necessary capabilities to obtain the required images and analyses, given the initial state and the constraints. The `drop_rock` actions might change the `free` predicate, but the setup with them does not make them applicable. The main rovers seem to be stuck in place. I have to communicate that this is a dead-end, I can't find a solution for this case.
