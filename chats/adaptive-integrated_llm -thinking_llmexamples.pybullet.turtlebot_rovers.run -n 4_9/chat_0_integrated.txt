           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Action Limitations**
           
           My initial assessment focused on constructing a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which requires establishing several `receivedimage` predicates and `receivedanalysis` predicates. To reach this goal, I broke down the requirements, focusing on achieving the image and analysis reception. I considered using `v14` as the rover, utilizing `v10` as its camera, and strategized to get the images.
           
           However, a critical constraint emerged: the *only* available actions are `move` and `drop_rock`. Neither can produce the required `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates which come from `send_image` and `send_analysis`, actions that are not available. The presence of continuous parameters, specifically configuration objects beginning with `#`, initially suggested a need to specify precise rover locations to facilitate line-of-sight conditions. But the actions available are limited.
           
           Despite the initial confusion regarding the specific interpretation of continuous parameters in the problem statement (i.e. if I must define new `#o3_rover_target` configurations for *each* required visibility), I must rely on only using the given actions. Since the given actions cannot produce the required goal state, the goal is unreachable.
