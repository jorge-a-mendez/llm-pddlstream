           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene contains a central open area, surrounded by walls (AABBs 0-4). There's a vertical wall in the middle (AABB 5). Several smaller obstacles are scattered, some of which are along the edges (e.g., AABB 7, 8, 9, 10 near y=2, AABB 11, 12 near x=2). There are also smaller obstacles in other regions (e.g., AABB 6, 13, 14, 18 near x=-2 and y=-2, AABB 15 near (0.3, 1), AABB 16 near (-0.7, -1.1), AABB 17 near (-0.8, 0.9)).
           
           My strategy is to find a set of points within the allowed range from the target. I'll prioritize points that are not too close to the known fixed obstacles. Given the target is (0.2, 0.2), which is in the central open area, I will try to find points in that area, avoiding the central vertical wall (AABB 5). I'll also consider points that might be on the other side of the central wall if it allows for a better view, but for a target in the center, staying on one side seems safer initially.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     The previous failures indicate that positions (0.2, 0.7) and (0.2, -0.3) collided with obstacle 5 (the central vertical wall). This is expected as the x-coordinate is 0.2, which is just past the obstacle's x-range of (-0.05, 0.05). The position (0.7, 0.2) had no line of sight to the target point (-2.115, 1.816). This is also expected, as the central wall (AABB 5) would block the view.
           
           The new target point is (-2.115, 1.816). This point is in the upper-left quadrant, very close to the wall and some obstacles (AABB 8, 19). I need to find positions within 2 units of this target.
           
           Since the target is to the left of the central wall (x = -2.115), I should primarily consider positions that are also to the left of the central wall to avoid occlusion by AABB 5. The target is also near the upper wall (y=1.816). I'll avoid being too close to the upper wall and the obstacles 8 ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)) and 19 ((-2.163, 1.768), (-2.067, 1.863)).

Model:     The previous target was (-2.115, 1.816). The positions (0.2, 0.7), (0.7, 0.2), and (0.2, -0.3) were rejected due to collision with the central wall (AABB 5) or no line-of-sight. For the previous request, the proposed position (-1.8, 1.8) collided with AABB 8 ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)). This makes sense as (-1.8, 1.8) falls right into this box. The other two positions, (-2.1, 1.0) and (-1.5, 1.5), were not explicitly failed, so they could still be valid.
           
           The new target point is (1.5, -2.0). This point is in the lower-right quadrant, near the bottom wall (y=-2.0) and to the right of the central wall. It's also near AABB 12 ((2.14, -1.84), (2.27, -1.70)). I need to find positions within 2 units of this target.
           
           I will prioritize points to the right of the central wall (AABB 5). Given the target is close to the bottom wall, I'll try to find positions that are also near the bottom, but not too close to the very corner where AABB 12 is, and also not too close to the very edge of the map.

Model:     The previous request had a target point of (1.5, -2.0) and all proposed positions (1.5, -1.0), (0.5, -2.0), and (2.0, -1.5) resulted in "no line of sight to target". This implies that there is a significant occlusion in that region for a target at (1.5, -2.0). The failed positions were all to the right of the central wall. Looking back at the new target point in the failures list: it was (1.927, 2.005), not (1.5, -2.0). This means my reasoning for the previous failure was incorrect.
           
           The *actual* previous target was (1.927, 2.005), which is in the upper-right quadrant, very close to the top and right walls, and also near obstacles 7 ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) and 21 ((1.87, 1.95), (1.97, 2.05)). All three proposed positions (1.5, -1.0), (0.5, -2.0), and (2.0, -1.5) for that target resulted in "no line of sight to target". This makes perfect sense now, as the central wall (AABB 5) would completely block the view from these lower positions to a target near the top right corner.
           
           The new target point is (-1.5, -1.5). This point is in the lower-left quadrant. It's to the left of the central wall (AABB 5) and near some obstacles like AABB 6, 13, 14, 16, and 18. I need to find positions within 2 units of this target.
           
           I will focus on positions to the left of the central wall (x < -0.05). The target is at (-1.5, -1.5), so I should try positions around it, but avoiding the numerous obstacles in this area, especially 6 ((-2.4, -2.3), (-1.39, -1.65)), 13 ((-1.95, -1.65), (-1.83, -1.53)), 14 ((-1.75, -1.16), (-1.63, -1.03)), 16 ((-0.73, -1.19), (-0.60, -1.06)), and 18 ((-1.86, -1.26), (-1.74, -1.14)). The target itself is very close to AABB 13.
           
           Positions:
           (-1.0 -1.5)
           (-1.5 -1.0)
           (-2.0 -2.0)
