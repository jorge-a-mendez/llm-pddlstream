           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning My Solution to new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, the goal is clear: get something of `type v17` to be *on* `v18`.  Easy enough, let's break it down.  I need to find an object, and I've got a couple of initial candidates: `v8` and `v12`.  They're both `type v17`.  Now, I need one of them on `v18`.  
           
           Looking at the initial state, neither is *initially* on `v18`.  To achieve this, I need to *place* one of them there.  The plan comes together: I need to pick up either `v8` or `v12` and then place it at a pose that has the supporting relation with the destination object. I have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`, which means I can place either at the pose `#o2`. I pick `v8` to keep the sequence simple.
           
           Here's my plan:
           
           1.  **Move Base:** The robot needs to be at a configuration where it can move and pick. I look at preconditions and conclude that `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` is necessary for enabling the robot to pick and place.
           2.  **Pick Up:** I then need to `pick` up `v8` which is currently at pose `v9`.
           3.  **Place:** After picking, I use the `place` action to get `v8` onto `v18`.
           
           I have confirmed that these three actions are sound, with each action's preconditions.  I have also ensured that this three-step sequence achieves my goal.  Additionally, I checked that all the actions are in the provided list.  I'm confident this is the simplest and most efficient route to achieving the goal. This approach utilizes the knowledge provided in the initial state to the fullest extent.  The choice to move the base first ensures the pick and place action is possible.
