           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers (v12, v14), a lander (v9), a camera (v10), and a store (v16). There are also several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and objectives (v17, v18) of different types. The camera v10 supports mode v11.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` is an axiom that represents the following conditions:
           *   `atconf(v12, v13)`
           *   `atconf(v14, v15)`
           *   `free(v12, v16)`
           *   `free(v14, v16)`
           *   `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           *   `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           *   `type(?stone, v2)` (meaning some rock of type v2 has been analyzed)
           *   `receivedanalysis(?stone)`
           *   `type(?soil, v6)` (meaning some rock of type v6 has been analyzed)
           *   `receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           Let's check the initial state against the goal conditions:
           *   `atconf(v12, v13)`: True initially.
           *   `atconf(v14, v15)`: True initially.
           *   `free(v12, v16)`: True initially.
           *   `free(v14, v16)`: True initially.
           *   `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: False initially. Need to achieve this.
           *   `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: False initially. Need to achieve this.
           *   `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: Need to find a rock of type v2, sample it, and send the analysis. Rocks v1, v3, v4 are of type v2.
           *   `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: Need to find a rock of type v6, sample it, and send the analysis. Rocks v5, v7, v8 are of type v6.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`:
           1.  Calibrate the camera.
           2.  Take an image.
           3.  Send the image.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis`:
           1.  Sample a rock.
           2.  Send the analysis.
           
           Both rovers (v12 and v14) are at their initial configurations and have a free store. The camera v10 is onboard both rovers. However, the camera is not calibrated for either rover.
           
           Let's plan for the image goals first.
           Rover v12 can see v17 and v18 with camera v10, ray #o4 at conf #o3.
           Rover v14 can also see v17 and v18 with camera v10, ray #o4 at conf #o3.
           Let's use rover v12 for the images.
           
           For `receivedimage(v17, v11)`:
           1.  Calibrate camera v10 for rover v12 at conf #o3 with ray #o4 for objective v17.
           2.  Take image of v17 with v12, camera v10, mode v11 at conf #o3 using ray #o4.
           3.  Send image of v17 (mode v11) from v12 at conf #o0 via ray #o1 to lander v9.
           
           For `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           1.  Calibrate camera v10 for rover v12 at conf #o3 with ray #o4 for objective v18. (Already calibrated after first image if no other action uncalibrates it.)
           2.  Take image of v18 with v12, camera v10, mode v11 at conf #o3 using ray #o4.
           3.  Send image of v18 (mode v11) from v12 at conf #o0 via ray #o1 to lander v9.
           
           Note that `calibrated(c, v)` is negated after `take_image`. So we need to recalibrate for each image.
           
           Let's plan for the analysis goals.
           Rover v12 is above v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8 at conf #o5.
           Rover v14 is above v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8 at conf #o5.
           We need one rock of type v2 and one of type v6 to be analyzed.
           Let's use rover v12 to sample a rock of type v2 (e.g., v1).
           Then use rover v14 to sample a rock of type v6 (e.g., v5).
           
           For `receivedanalysis(v1)` (type v2):
           1.  Rover v12 samples rock v1 at conf #o5 using store v16.
           2.  Rover v12 sends analysis of v1 from conf #o0 via ray #o1 to lander v9.
           
           For `receivedanalysis(v5)` (type v6):
           1.  Rover v14 samples rock v5 at conf #o5 using store v16.
           2.  Rover v14 sends analysis of v5 from conf #o0 via ray #o1 to lander v9.
           
           Combining these, and considering that both rovers are already at their respective `atconf` positions, and have free stores. The only allowed actions are `move` and `drop_rock`. This means the more complex actions like `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` are not available in the given list of valid action instances. This implies the goal is unreachable with the given set of allowed actions. The problem statement explicitly states: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           Since the actions required to achieve the goal (calibrate, take_image, send_image, sample_rock, send_analysis) are not in the list of allowed action instances, the goal is unreachable.
           
           The `new-axiom@0()` states that `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for a stone of type `v2` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for a soil of type `v6` must be true. None of the available actions (move, drop_rock) can achieve these conditions. The initial state does not have these conditions met either.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable.
