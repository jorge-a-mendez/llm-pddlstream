User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is largely bounded by a square from -2.5 to 2.5 in both x and y. There's a central vertical wall at x=0, and several smaller obstacles scattered around, especially in the upper half of the environment. I will try to place the robot in open areas, avoiding the known obstacles and the bounding walls.
           
           The target is (2.0306122448979593, -1.3877551020408163). This point is in the bottom-right quadrant, relatively close to the right wall (x=2.5) and bottom wall (y=-2.5). There's an obstacle at 15: ((1.8785294768932317, -0.6702606799480464), (2.019950223195269, -0.5288399336460088)) and 17: ((1.9817175389956334, -1.9866784094144008), (2.116803693609347, -1.8515922548006871)) which are relatively close to the target, so I should be careful not to place the base directly on them or to create an occlusion. I will explore positions around the target point, ensuring they are within the max_range of 2 and within the overall environment boundaries. I will try to place the robot to the left, bottom-left, and bottom of the target, considering potential occlusions from the obstacles mentioned.
