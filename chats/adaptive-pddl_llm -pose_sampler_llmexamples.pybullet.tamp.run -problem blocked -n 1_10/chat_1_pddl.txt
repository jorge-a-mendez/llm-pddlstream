           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes several objects and their initial states. We have `v8`, `v12`, and `v15` as graspable and stackable objects. `v8` and `v12` are of type `v17`. These objects have initial poses `v9`, `v13`, and `v16` respectively. `v8` is supported by `v11` and `v18`. `v12` is supported by `v10` and `v18`. `v15` is supported by `v11` and `v10`. The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both are handempty. The robot is at base configuration `v3` and arm configurations `v5` for `v4` and `v7` for `v6`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true. This means we need to find an object `?green` that is of type `v17` and place it on `v18`. From the initial state, `v8` and `v12` are of type `v17`. `v8` is currently on `v11` and `v18` (due to `supported(v8, v9, v11)` and `supported(v8, v9, v18)` and `atpose(v8, v9)`). `v12` is on `v10` and `v18` (due to `supported(v12, v13, v10)` and `supported(v12, v13, v18)` and `atpose(v12, v13)`). Therefore, both `v8` and `v12` already satisfy `type(?green, v17)` and `on(?green, v18)`. This means the goal is already satisfied in the initial state.
           
           The only available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which results in moving the base from `v3` to `v3`, which is effectively a no-op that consumes `canmove()` and then re-adds it. This action does not change any predicates relevant to the goal.
           
           Since the goal is already satisfied in the initial state, no actions are needed. However, the problem requires a plan if the goal is achievable. If no actions are truly necessary, an empty plan would suffice. But since `move_base` is given, and it's a no-op in terms of achieving the goal, it can be considered a valid, albeit trivial, plan.
           
           --Plan--:
           (move_base v3 v3 #o0)

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Fact is not satisfied: Atom new-axiom@0()`. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     My apologies, I misinterpreted the `new-axiom@0()` as being satisfied if *any* object of type `v17` is on `v18`. The axiom actually implicitly defines `?green` within its scope, meaning `?green` needs to be consistently instantiated. The current state has `on(v8, v18)` and `type(v8, v17)`, and `on(v12, v18)` and `type(v12, v17)`. These facts directly satisfy the conditions for `new-axiom@0()`, where `?green` could be `v8` or `v12`.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the initial state and the goal:
           Initial State includes:
           - `atpose(v8, v9)`
           - `supported(v8, v9, v11)` and `supported(v8, v9, v18)` which means `on(v8, v11)` and `on(v8, v18)`.
           - `type(v8, v17)`
           
           - `atpose(v12, v13)`
           - `supported(v12, v13, v14)` and `supported(v12, v13, v10)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` and `atpose(v12, v13)` which implies `on(v12, v14)`, `on(v12, v10)` and potentially `on(v12, v18)` if `v13` is `#o2`.
           
           - `atpose(v15, v16)`
           - `supported(v15, v16, v11)` which means `on(v15, v11)`.
           - `type(v15, v17)` is NOT explicitly given. Only `type(v12, v17)` and `type(v8, v17)` are given.
           
           The axiom `new-axiom@0()` is defined as:
           `Axiom new-axiom@0()`
             `Conjunction`
               `Atom on(?green, v18)`
               `Atom type(?green, v17)`
           
           From the initial state:
           - For `v8`: `on(v8, v18)` is true (derived from `supported(v8, v9, v18)` and `atpose(v8, v9)`). `type(v8, v17)` is true.
           So, `v8` can be `?green` and satisfies `new-axiom@0()`.
           
           - For `v12`: `on(v12, v18)` is true (derived from `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` and `atpose(v12, v13)`. If `v13` and `#o2` are the same pose, then it's on `v18`. Let's assume `v13` is `#o2` for this to be valid. Or more directly, `supported(v12, v13, v18)` could be implied if `v14` is `v18`). The initial state states `supported(v12, v13, v14)`. It also states `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` and `pose(v12, #o2)`. Since `atpose(v12, v13)` is given, if `#o2` is `v13`, then `on(v12, v18)` is true. It is also given `type(v12, v17)`. So, `v12` can also be `?green` and satisfies `new-axiom@0()`.
           
           Given these facts, `new-axiom@0()` appears to be true in the initial state because both `v8` and `v12` fulfill the requirements for `?green`. If the goal `new-axiom@0()` is not satisfied, it implies that the interpretation of the axiom or the state is different from my understanding. It might be that `v13` is not `#o2`, or `v9` is not `#o2`, and therefore `on(v8, v18)` and `on(v12, v18)` are not directly true *unless* the specific `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` facts match the `atpose` facts.
           
           Let's re-examine carefully for `on(?o, ?r)`.
           Axiom `on(?o: object, ?r: object)`:
             `Conjunction`
               `Atom supported(?o, ?p, ?r)`
               `Atom atpose(?o, ?p)`
           
           For `v8` to be `on(v8, v18)`:
           We need `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)`.
           From the initial state:
           `atpose(v8, v9)`
           `supported(v8, v9, v11)`
           `supported(v8, v9, v18)`
           Since `supported(v8, v9, v18)` and `atpose(v8, v9)` are both true, it means `on(v8, v18)` is true.
           Also, `type(v8, v17)` is true.
           Therefore, `new-axiom@0()` is true in the initial state with `?green = v8`.
           
           Given the previous rejection, there must be a subtle misunderstanding. Perhaps the continuous parameters like `#o2` are not equivalent to `v9` or `v13` by default, or the problem setup implies that these derived facts are not directly available until an action is taken, or there's a specific instance of `new-axiom@0()` that needs to be satisfied. However, based on PDDL semantics, if the predicates and axioms are satisfied, the goal should be met.
           
           The only action available is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not change the facts relevant to the `on` predicate or `type` predicate. It merely changes `atbconf(v3)` to `atbconf(v3)` and consumes/re-adds `canmove()`. It will not make `new-axiom@0()` true if it's not already true.
           
           If the goal is truly not satisfied by the initial state, and the only available action does not change the state in a way that could satisfy the goal, then the goal is unreachable.
           
           Given that the previous response was rejected with "Fact is not satisfied: Atom new-axiom@0()", it means my reasoning that the goal is already satisfied is incorrect. Since `move_base` does not modify any state relevant to `on` or `type` predicates, and it's the *only* available action instance, no sequence of available actions can change the state to satisfy `new-axiom@0()` if it's not already satisfied.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable with the given set of available actions.
