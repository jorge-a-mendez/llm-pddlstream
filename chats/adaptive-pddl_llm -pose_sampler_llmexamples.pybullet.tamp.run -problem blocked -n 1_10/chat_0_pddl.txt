           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)
           Atom type(v8, v17)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom pose(v15, v16)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)

           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains several objects, some of which are stackable and graspable. There are two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both of which are currently empty. There are three main objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v15`. All of them are at specific poses, and are supported by other objects. The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. In the current initial state, we have `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`, which means `on(v8, v11)`. We also have `type(v8, v17)`. Similarly, `on(v12, v14)` and `type(v12, v17)`. We also have `on(v15, v11)` and no type information for `v15`. For `new-axiom@0()` to be true, we need to have an object of type `v17` on `v18`. From the initial state, `v8` and `v12` are of `type v17`. `v18` supports `v8` at `#o2` and `v12` at `#o2` and `v12` at `v13`. We need to move either `v8` or `v12` to `v18`. However, there are no pick or place actions provided in the `action instances`. The only action available is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, which doesn't change the state of objects on surfaces. Since no pick or place actions are available, we cannot achieve the goal of placing `v8` or `v12` on `v18`. Thus, the goal is unreachable.
