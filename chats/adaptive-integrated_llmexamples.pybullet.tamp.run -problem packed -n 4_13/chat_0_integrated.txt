User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.185, 0.412), (0.284, 0.511)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.145, 0.22), (0.23, 0.306)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.293, -0.344), (-0.212, -0.263)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.257, 0.427), (-0.179, 0.505)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.235, 0.461, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.399, 0.917).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.187, 0.263, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.129, 0.992).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.253, -0.304, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.765, 0.644).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.218, 0.466, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.75, 0.662).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains four graspable objects: v8, v12, v14, and v16. These objects are initially located at different poses on a surface v11. The goal is to stack all four objects on surface v18. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, both of which are initially empty. The robot is at base configuration v3.
           
           The available action instances only include a `move_base` action from v3 to v3, using trajectory #o0. This implies that the robot cannot change its base position. Since picking and placing objects are not in the list of available actions, and there are no actions for cleaning or cooking, it is impossible to move any of the objects. The goal requires all four objects to be on surface v18, but they are currently on v11. Since no actions are available to move the objects, this goal is unreachable.
