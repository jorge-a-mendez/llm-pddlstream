           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes two rovers, v12 and v14, each equipped with a camera v10 and a store v16. Both rovers are at specific configurations, v13 and v15 respectively. There are several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) of two types (v2, v6) and two objectives (v17, v18). The camera v10 supports mode v11. There's a lander v9.
           
           The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom representing a conjunction of several conditions:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover v12 is at configuration v13. This is true initially.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover v14 is at configuration v15. This is true initially.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: Store v16 on rover v12 is free. This is true initially.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: Store v16 on rover v14 is free. This is true initially.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: Image of objective v17 in mode v11 has been received.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Image of objective v18 in mode v11 has been received.
           7. `type(?stone, v2)`: Some rock of type v2 exists. (v1, v3, v4 are of type v2)
           8. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: Analysis of a rock of type v2 has been received.
           9. `type(?soil, v6)`: Some rock of type v6 exists. (v5, v7, v8 are of type v6)
           10. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: Analysis of a rock of type v6 has been received.
           
           Looking at the available actions:
           - `move` actions are given but move the rovers to their current positions, which doesn't change anything relevant to the goal.
           - `drop_rock` actions are given but `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are already true, so dropping a rock would require the store to be full, which it isn't.
           
           The core parts of the goal that are not initially met are:
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (for a rock of type v2)
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (for a rock of type v6)
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`, we need to `take_image` and then `send_image`.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis`, we need to `sample_rock` and then `send_analysis`.
           
           Let's check if we can perform these actions with the given initial state.
           
           **For `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:**
           - `imagevisible` facts are given for both v12 and v14 for objectives v17 and v18 in the same configuration (#o3) and ray (#o4).
           - `onboard(v10, v12)` and `onboard(v10, v14)` are true.
           - `supports(v10, v11)` is true.
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are true.
           - We need to `calibrate` the camera first, then `take_image`, then `send_image`.
           - The `calibrate` action requires `imagevisible`, `onboard`, `atconf`, and `~blocked(?y)`. There is no `blocked(#o4)` initially.
           - The `take_image` action requires `calibrated`, in addition to the `calibrate` preconditions.
           - The `send_image` action requires `comvisible`, `haveimage`, `atconf`, and `~blocked(?y)`. `comvisible` is true for both rovers from #o0 via #o1 to v9. There is no `blocked(#o1)` initially.
           
           So, for rover v12:
           1. `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)` (or v18, or v17 and v18 as the camera is calibrated once)
           2. `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`
           3. `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`
           And similarly for v18.
           
           **For `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`:**
           - We need to `sample_rock` first, then `send_analysis`.
           - `sample_rock` requires `above`, `store`, `atconf`, and `free`.
           - `send_analysis` requires `comvisible`, `rock`, `analyzed`, `atconf`, `~blocked`.
           - Rocks of type v2: v1, v3, v4. Rocks of type v6: v5, v7, v8.
           - Rover v12 is `above` v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8 at conf #o5.
           - Rover v14 is `above` v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8 at conf #o5.
           - `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true.
           - `comvisible` facts are present for both rovers to lander v9.
           
           So, for rover v12:
           1. `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v1, v16)` (for a rock of type v2, v1 is suitable)
           2. `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v1)`
           3. `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v5, v16)` (for a rock of type v6, v5 is suitable) - However, the store will be full after sampling the first rock. So, we'd need another store or drop the first rock after sending analysis. Rover v12 only has one store v16, and after `sample_rock` the store becomes `full(v12, v16)`. The goal is to receive *an* analysis for each type, not necessarily from the same rock or the same rover. Since `free(v14, v16)` is also true, rover v14 can sample a rock of the other type.
           
           Let's plan to use rover v12 for type v2 rock and v14 for type v6 rock, or v12 for both by dropping the first sample. The problem states that `free(v12,v16)` and `free(v14,v16)` are true. After `sample_rock` action the store becomes `full`. The `drop_rock` action is in the available list. So, it is possible for a rover to sample, analyze, drop, then sample another rock.
           
           It's more efficient to use both rovers for sampling since they both have free stores.
           
           Plan:
           1. Calibrate camera on rover v12.
           2. Take image of objective v17 using v12.
           3. Send image of objective v17 using v12.
           4. Take image of objective v18 using v12. (The camera is already calibrated from step 1)
           5. Send image of objective v18 using v12.
           6. Sample a rock of type v2 (e.g., v1) using rover v12.
           7. Send analysis of rock v1 using v12.
           8. Sample a rock of type v6 (e.g., v5) using rover v14.
           9. Send analysis of rock v5 using v14.
           
           --Plan--:
           (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)
           (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)
           (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11)

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10), (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11), (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11), (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11), (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11), (sample_rock v12 #o5 v1 v16), (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v1), (sample_rock v14 #o5 v5 v16), (send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v5)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The provided list of valid actions only includes `move` actions that result in no change of state (moving a rover to its current configuration) and `drop_rock` actions, which require the store to be full, but the initial state shows both stores are free.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires:
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for type v2 rock
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for type v6 rock
           
           To achieve these, the robot needs to perform `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions. None of these actions are present in the provided list of valid action instances.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the given limited set of valid actions.
