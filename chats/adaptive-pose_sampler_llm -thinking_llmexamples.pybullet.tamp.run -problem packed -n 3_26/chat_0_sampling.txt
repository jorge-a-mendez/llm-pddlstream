(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy**
           
           I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 4) on a square surface (surface 0). The core idea is to understand how the object's rotation affects its bounding box and, consequently, the allowable placement area.
           
           The object's size and the surface dimensions are given. A placement is considered stable if the object's bounding box fully fits within the surface's bounding box. For a square object, rotating it changes the dimensions of its rotated bounding box, but importantly, the rotated bounding box remains a square with a size that depends on the angle of rotation (`theta`).
           
           To find the stable placements, I will calculate the maximum allowed shift for each angle, based on surface size and rotated bounding box. I am using the concept of creating a safe margin on x and y, that is based on the rotated object bounding box. This margin depends on the theta, where I have selected 5 values (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2).
           
           By strategically choosing 10 different x and y coordinates within the allowable range for each angle, I will generate a total of 50 unique and stable placements. Surface index will always be 0.

(Thoughts: **My plan for object 5's placement on surface 0, avoiding collision with object 4 (ID:4) at (0, 0, 0) and side length 0.091:**
           
           Having successfully placed object 4, I'm now tasked with positioning object 5, which is a square with side length 's5' = 0.0764. The surface is still defined as  [(-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)]. My goal is to find 50 stable placements for object 5 that are collision-free.
           
           I've already calculated the critical values:
           -   Half the side of object 4:  half_s4 = 0.0455.
           -   Half rotation size:  half_s_obj_rot = s_obj / 2 = 0.038.
           -   The limit for surface coordinate: lim_surf_0 = 0.0968.
           -   The "clearance distance," which determines the minimum distance to object 4: dist_clear_0 = 0.08375.
           
           Object 4 has been set at (0,0) and a rotation of 0. So, I will need to use rotation strategy of (0,pi/2) with object 5 to calculate rotations in order to ensure the non-overlapping in coordinate space of the current placement.  I will then place two orientations to achieve the 50 points of placement.
           
           I've determined that rotating object 5 by angles like pi/8, pi/4, or 3\*pi/8 would be problematic. This is because these rotations would cause object 5's effective size to become too large to fit in the available space around object 4. This is a very important fact to note and to avoid those.
           
           With these smaller rotations ruled out, this means I am going to have to find placements for object 5 for rotations of `0` and `pi/2`.
           
           So, the key condition is that either the x-coordinate must be far enough to the left or right of object 4 (outside its bounding box), or the y-coordinate must be sufficiently above or below it. So there will be 4 sets of regions that will be populated.
           
           Since the available non-collision area is small I will create a structured approach to generate the 50 points, with 25 points at each rotation.
           
           Let's do the math. To make sure collision doesn't occur, the x coordinates are going to have to be further than the clearance which I calculated as `0.08375498323154329`.  And to make sure that y coordinates are also collision-free, they will have to be greater than this threshold.
           
           1.  To generate the first set of 25 unique points for `theta = 0`:
           
               1.  9 points will be positioned in the Top-left (y high values) to the x-axis value (0.000) for the left set, with the right edge.
                   Here I am using (x\_val\_L\_pts), which includes values which are outside of (0.09) of the current position to the (x,0) value.
               2.  Same with bottom right, with 9 points will be positioned in the Bottom right quadrant.
               3.  3 points in the left middle.
               4.  3 points in the right middle.
               5.  1 extra point in the top middle.

               - `lim_s = 0.09679965899463782`
               - `cl_d = 0.08375498323154329`

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 6 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 6 on surface 0, considering objects ID 4 and ID 5 as fixed obstacles. Object 6 is a square with side length *s6* = 0.086586. Surface 0 has dimensions of ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           Object ID 4 is positioned at (0.0, 0.0) with *s4* = 0.091109.  Its bounding box (AABB) is a square from (-0.0455, -0.0455) to (0.0455, 0.0455).
           
           Object ID 5 is at (-0.0968, 0.0837) with *s5* = 0.0764. Its AABB is from (-0.135, 0.0455) to (-0.0585, 0.1219).
           
           My analysis considers the implications of rotating object 6. For a rotation angle, *theta*, the effective side length, *s6_rot*, changes.  I first focus on *theta* = 0 (no rotation) and *theta* = pi/2 (90 degree rotation), as intermediate rotations cause collision with object 4, given the bounds.
           
           For *theta* = 0, the maximum allowed center position of object 6,  accounting for the surface bounds, is 0.0917. Object 6 can not overlap objects 4 or 5. To prevent collision with object 4, the center must be beyond ± 0.0888. In the case of object 5, collision is avoided by ensuring that object 6 lies entirely outside the bounds of the AABB 5 or 5.
           
           Given these constraints and avoiding overlaps, I will choose 25 points for *theta* = 0. The points are constructed to have a variety of locations, using the defined constraints. The same 25 points are also copied to be applicable for *theta* = pi/2.
