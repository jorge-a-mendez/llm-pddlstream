(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable, collision-free placements for a near-square object (ID 5, dimensions ~0.096 x 0.096) on a rectangular surface (AABB: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`).  Given my expertise, I immediately recognized the need to consider the object's rotation. Since the object is almost square, I understand that many rotations won't significantly impact the AABB.
           
           To ensure the object remains entirely within the surface, I calculate the allowed ranges for x and y positions based on the rotated AABB.  The key is calculating the `rotated_size_x` and `rotated_size_y` based on the rotation `theta`, which, for a square-like object, is dictated primarily by the object's original dimensions.
           
           I've decided to employ a grid-based approach. I'll test several key rotations to ensure adequate coverage and diversity and then place an x,y grid around the allowed space for the current rotation.  I am calculating the valid bounding box for x and y placement at multiple theta angles. Then I'm generating a 3x3 grid for the x and y dimensions.
           
           I've selected the following angles to cover rotation possibilities:  0, pi/10, pi/5, 3*pi/10, 2*pi/5, pi/2.  I generate all possible x, y placements within the bounds of that angle, given an increment of the bounds.
           This will generate 54 potential placements, of which I will take the first 50.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement and Collision Detection**
           
           Okay, here's what I've been working on. I need to figure out where to put a new object (ID 4) on a surface without it crashing into another object (ID 5) that's already there. Object 4 is basically a square, and I know the successful placement of object 5.
           
           First, I figured out the safe zone for object 4. I started by getting the dimensions and the successful placement of Object 5. Knowing where Object 5 is helps me define its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box), which is essentially a rectangular box around the object. Then, I needed to know the dimensions for Object 4.
           
           I started by rotating and calculating a potential rotation to ensure I covered various positions. I iterated over different angles of rotation and AABBs.
           
           The tricky part is making sure Object 4 doesn't overlap with Object 5. I created a collision detection check between the AABBs of the two objects. I made sure to check the boundaries of the surface and that the rotations would fit within those boundaries.
           
           I designed a program that generates potential placement locations for Object 4, which were represented as x,y coordinates with a `theta` angle. For these placements, I'll calculate the AABB of object 4 and then compare the object 4 AABB with the pre-calculated object 5 AABB. I am using a collision detection check between the AABBs. If any placements do not collide with object 5, it means that the placement is valid.
           
           I am using `linspace` to generate the correct x and y centers to ensure a variety of choices.  With a 5x5 grid of candidates across different angles, I found more than the needed 50 collision-free placements. The code is running to find the placements.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Object Placement on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable locations for a new, nearly square object (ID 6) on a single surface, surface 0, measuring 0.27 x 0.27. I have to avoid collisions with two pre-existing objects: object 5, situated in the bottom-left corner of the surface, and object 4, which is centered along the left edge. Their extents and positions are precisely calculated using bounding boxes (AABBs).
           
           My approach involves a systematic strategy:
           
           1.  **Angle Selection:** I'll consider various rotation angles for object 6, including 0, π/10, π/5, 3π/10, 2π/5, and π/2.
           
           2.  **AABB Computation:** For each angle, I need to accurately calculate the AABB's width and height of the rotated object 6, which is crucial for collision detection.
           
           3.  **Valid Center Range:** Next, I'll determine the valid range for the object's center point within the surface. This depends on the object's rotated dimensions and ensures the object remains entirely within the surface boundaries.
           
           4.  **Grid Generation:** Within the valid ranges, I will create a grid of potential center points to explore.
           
           5.  **Placement Evaluation:** I will assess the proposed placement using the following steps:
               *   Calculate the AABB for object 6, based on the current center point and rotation.
               *   Verify there's no collision with object 5's AABB.
               *   Verify there's no collision with object 4's AABB.
               *   If no collision, the position is added to the valid placements.
           
           The core of this approach is accurate calculation of AABBs for rotated objects, a critical aspect of efficient collision detection in this configuration task. Since object 6 is almost square, I have to compute its rotated dimensions accurately using trigonometric functions.  I will then select and provide a minimum of 50 unique, valid placements.
