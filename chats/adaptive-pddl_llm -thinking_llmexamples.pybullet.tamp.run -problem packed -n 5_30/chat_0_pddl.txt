           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Unachievable Goal: A Constraint-Induced Impasse**
           
           Okay, here's the situation: I'm tasked with devising a plan to get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` all *on* object `v20`.  My understanding is that "on" means both the `supported` and `atpose` predicates need to be true.  So, for each object, I need to find a way to make the necessary `supported` and `atpose` facts hold true with respect to `v20`.
           
           Initially, I looked at the facts and noticed that all of these objects are currently on object `v11`. Good to know. I also have potential `supported` positions for these objects on `v20`.
           
           The key is moving those objects from `v11` to `v20`. Given the available actions – `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook` – it's clear that `clean` and `cook` are irrelevant here. The only relevant actions are `pick` and `place`. We're working with two robot arms, both empty to start.  Now, the problem.
           
           The killer constraint. The prompt specifies *only* `move_base` as a valid action instance.  No `pick`, no `place`.  And that, my friend, is the deal-breaker.  `move_base` affects only the base configuration of the robot, not the positions of objects. It has no effect on the `atpose` and `supported` predicates.
           
           Therefore, because `pick` and `place` are explicitly disallowed by the list of valid actions, I'm stuck.  I have initial facts showing the current `on` positions, and I have target positions on `v20`, but I have no way to get the objects to their targets using the provided actions.  The goal is simply unreachable.  I've double-checked my work.  No initial conditions match the goal and I can't modify the initial `atpose` by any allowable action.
