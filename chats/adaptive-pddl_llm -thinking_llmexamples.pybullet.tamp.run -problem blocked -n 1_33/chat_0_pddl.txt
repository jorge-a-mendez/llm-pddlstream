           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning about Goal Reachability**
           
           My primary objective is to develop a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a specific type be placed "on" another object.  Initially, I identify that the goal requires an object of `type v17` to be `on v18`. I assess the current state and determine that objects `v8` and `v12` are of the required type.
           
           My initial approach involves examining the `on` predicate and its defining axiom. I determine that to satisfy `on(?o, v18)`, I must ensure `supported(?o, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)` are true for some pose `p`.  Currently, neither `v8` nor `v12` fulfills these conditions; they are `on` other objects.
           
           The task then becomes devising a plan to move either `v8` or `v12` onto `v18`. This necessitates the use of `pick` and `place` actions to manipulate the `atpose` of these objects. However, a significant constraint arises: the allowed action instances are limited to `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This severely restricts my options, as no `pick` or `place` instances are available.
           
           The crucial issue is the interpretation of "valid action instances."  If this means only the provided `move_base` can be utilized in the plan, then the goal becomes immediately unreachable. Since the `move_base` action solely moves the robot's base and does not affect the `on` state of objects, it is incapable of facilitating the required change. Therefore, under the stringent constraint, I must conclude that the goal is unattainable.
