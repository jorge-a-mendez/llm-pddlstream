(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Achieving `new-axiom@0()` in the `pr2-tamp` Domain**
           
           Okay, so the goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially translates to making an object `?green` be *both* `on v18` and of `type v17`.  I've got a couple of options for `?green`: `v8` or `v12`, both meeting the `type` requirement. My initial thought is to go with `v8`, let's see why:
           
           To get `on(v8, v18)`, I need to find a pose `?p` where `v8` is `supported` by `v18` *and* I need to get `v8` to that pose (i.e., ensure `atpose(v8, ?p)`).  Looking at the initial state, I see that `v8` is *already* of the right type, which is good.  Crucially, there's a fact: `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. This tells me that if `v8` is at the pose `#o2`, it *will* be on `v18`.  Excellent, this seems like a solid path.
           
           The plan then is: get `v8` to pose `#o2`.  Currently, it's at `v9`. I'll use the available robot arm `v4`.  It looks like I can pick and place `v8` using `v4`.  The plan is to:
           
           1.  **Move the base** from its initial configuration (`v3`) to a new base configuration (`#o3`).  This is because some preconditions for pick/place require the robot arm to have the correct base configuration.
           
           2.  **Pick `v8`**.  The arm `v4` needs to pick up `v8` from its current location `v9`.  The initial state provides necessary `kin` facts and  hand empty preconditions.
           
           3.  **Place `v8`**.  The arm `v4` will then place `v8` at pose `#o2` so that it is `on v18`.
           
           I've carefully checked the preconditions for `pick` and `place`. All of the needed facts for these actions are present, except for base configuration which will be satisfied with the move base action, and, crucially, no conflicting facts or unsafe facts are present.
           
           Once this plan is executed, `v8` will be `atpose(#o2)`, and due to the existing `supported` fact, `on(v8, v18)` will hold.  That, in combination with the initial fact about the type of `v8`, satisfies the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This should do it. I'm reasonably confident in this plan.
