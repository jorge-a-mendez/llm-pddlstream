           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**
           
           Alright, the objective is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to ensuring an object (`?green`) of a specific type (`v17`) is situated "on" a particular object (`v18`).  My initial assessment focuses on dissecting the initial state to identify potential candidates for `?green` and then evaluating their current "on" status with respect to `v18`.
           
           **Analyzing the Initial State and Identifying Candidates**
           
           The initial state contains the key predicates: `type(?green, v17)`, which I examine to find applicable objects. I quickly identify `v8` and `v12` as potential values for `?green` since both satisfy this type constraint. Now, I have to figure out if either of them is actually "on" `v18`.
           
           The "on" predicate (`on(?green, v18)`) is defined by two sub-conditions: `supported(?green, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(?green, ?p)`. So, I'm now checking if `v8` (and, subsequently, `v12`) satisfies these two conditions.
           
           **Checking `v8`'s Status**
           
           For `v8`, I know it's currently at pose `v9`. The crucial question is: is it supported by `v18` at that pose?  The initial state reveals that `v8` is *currently* supported by `v11` (at pose `v9`).  While the facts *do* show `v8` being supported by `v18` at some pose (`#o2`), it's *not* at its *current* pose. Therefore, `on(v8, v18)` is false.
           
           **Checking `v12`'s Status**
           
           I follow the same process for `v12`. I know it's located at `v13`. It's supported by `v14`. While it *could* be at some pose `#o2`, the facts don't currently indicate that `v12` is supported by `v18` at its *current* pose, therefore `on(v12, v18)` is false too.
           
           **Action Analysis: The Challenge of Limited Actions**
           
           The only action I can use is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action manipulates the robot's configuration but doesn't have a direct effect on "on" or related predicates like `supported` and `atpose`.  I need to use `pick` and `place`, which are not an available action instance.
           
           **Reaching an Unavoidable Conclusion**
           
           Since neither `v8` nor `v12` are initially "on" `v18`, and my allowed action instance is useless for moving any object to change the "on" status, the goal is unreachable.  I've systematically explored all possibilities, and given the limitations of the environment, I'm forced to conclude the plan is futile. The goal `new-axiom@0()` is not achievable under these conditions.
