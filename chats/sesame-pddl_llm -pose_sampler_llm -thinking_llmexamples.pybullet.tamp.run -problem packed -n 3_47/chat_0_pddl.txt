           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **I need to generate 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 6, side 0.0846) on a square surface (0, corners (-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).**  To ensure stability and full containment, I'll need to consider how the object's rotation affects its bounding box's size.  Since it's a square, any rotation is valid.  I'll start by defining the surface's boundary and calculating the effective half-width of the rotated object's bounding box. The effective half-width is the half-width of the object’s bounding box as rotated. For a square, I can calculate this by knowing the side of the square and the angle of rotation, `theta`.
           
           Since I know the maximum dimension is when it is rotated 45 degrees,  I'll pick a few angles to cover a range of rotations, in radians, 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2, and I can take advantage of the symmetry that exists in a square object. I know that for a square object, the dimensions of the bounding box will repeat every 90 degrees. I will then create a grid of points within the valid `(x, y)` range for each rotation, distributing the positions to ensure diversity. The range of (x,y) I will compute based on the valid dimensions given the angle.
           
           To ensure exactly 50 placements, I'll select 5 rotations (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2). Then, for each angle I compute the bounds for X and Y, and distribute 10 placement values across the allowable range, to ensure I have 50 total placements.
           
           Here are the 50 placements:

(Thoughts: **Placing Object 5: A Detailed Approach to Avoiding Collision**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed object ID 6, which is now a fixed obstacle. My next challenge is to place object ID 5, another square, on the *same* surface without it colliding with object 6. I've got the extents of object 5, `s_5`, and its potential surface `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I need to generate 50 stable placements, but the key is to *avoid* object 6.
           
           First, I defined the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) for object 6, based on its successful placement. I know object 6's size, `s_6`, and its placement `(0, 0.0, -0.09268816815053954, -0.09268816815053954)`. Since the rotation is zero, the AABB is straightforward, a square centered at its placement, which means it occupies the lower-left corner of the surface from `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(-0.050376..., -0.050376...)`.
           
           Now, for object 5, I calculated `s_5_half` and the `effective_half_side_5`, considering its rotation, `theta`. At its maximum, when `theta` is `pi/4`, `effective_half_side_5` is approximately `0.0699...`, and the minimum at `0`, is `0.0494...`. Both are within the surface bounds.
           
           The next step is to generate placements. I'll take a grid-like approach, with 5 rotations and 10 positions per rotation, carefully checking if the AABB of object 5 overlaps with object 6's AABB for each placement. I'll use `x_min_5, x_max_5, y_min_5, y_max_5` for object 5 and the `bbox6` (defined by the corners of `object 6`) for comparison. The goal is to ensure: if the AABBs of objects 5 and 6 would overlap at a given placement, then discard it.
           
           I defined the non-collision conditions: either `x_max_5 <= x6_min` or `x_min_5 >= x6_max` or `y_max_5 <= y6_min` or `y_min_5 >= y6_max`. To simplify, I focused on the "exclusion zone". This zone defines a area that is occupied by Object 6 and where the center of object 5 would overlap. The center of object 5 at position `(x, y)` has to satisfy the exclusion conditions to be discarded.
           
           For `theta = 0`, I defined the safe placement as `x >= -0.0009...` or `y >= -0.0009...` in order to exclude collision.
           For the other rotations I will use this as a guidance.
           
           I generated the valid set of placement points for a `5x5` grid for the surface. I also tested a few to make sure the algorithm is correct.

(Thoughts: **My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a new object (ID 4) on surface 0 while avoiding collisions with existing objects (ID 6 and ID 5).**  I'll start by defining the object's properties: its size (`s_4`) and half-size (`s_4_half`), then understanding the surface's dimensions.
           
           The surface has a maximum and minimum x and y. I have two other objects that are placed on the same surface. I'll need to calculate the bounding boxes (AABBs) for the existing objects and then determine safe placement zones for the new object, focusing on minimizing overlaps.
           
           I'll be rotating the object to see which orientations are safe. I'll need to define a strategy for collision avoidance.  I'll calculate the new `effective_half_s_4` which includes the original size plus rotation. The object center (`x_4, y_4`) needs to satisfy the constraints of the surface and no collisions.  I'll simplify the conditions to focus on placing ID 4 above and/or to the right of the other objects to increase the chances of fitting more items.
           
           I have already calculated the size of ID 4:
           `s_4 = 0.09187980569043122`.
           `s_4_half = 0.04593990284521561`
           
           I'm starting my calculations at `theta=0`, and increasing through 5 different values: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2.
           
           For a rotation angle of 0, `effective_half_s_4 = s_4_half = 0.04593990284521561`.
           The x bounds are `[-0.08906, 0.08906]`, the y bounds are `[-0.08906, 0.08906]`.
           I determined that for `theta = 0`, I need `y_4 >= 0.009844`.
           I'll be generating `x` and `y` points for placement, and then checking collisions with existing objects.
           For `theta = 0` I found that I need to place the y coordinates at 0.009844.
           
           Now, for each angle I'll go through the calculations to determine a safe grid with a minimal overlap, and find 10 locations. The code is structured to accomplish this task and repeat the process for all five rotations to satisfy the 50 total placements.
