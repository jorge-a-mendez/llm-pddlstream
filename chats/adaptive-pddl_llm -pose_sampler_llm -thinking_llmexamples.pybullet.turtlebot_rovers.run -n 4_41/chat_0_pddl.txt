           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Winning Plan: A Deep Dive**
           
           My analysis has identified a comprehensive plan to achieve the `new-axiom@0()` goal. The crux of the challenge lies in satisfying a set of conjunctive conditions, primarily focused on ensuring that both rovers maintain their initial configurations (a crucial constraint) and receive analysis results for specified rocks, along with image acquisition. Since movement is extremely limited, the entire strategy is constructed around assuming that spatial continuous parameters such as object coordinates are equivalent to or compatible with my current position, which is the key assumption.
           
           The problem breaks down into two primary tasks: image acquisition and rock analysis. For image acquisition, I will use rover `v14` (as `v12` is not suited for it). This will involve calibrating the camera on `v14` for each image, taking the image, and transmitting it. Because of constraints on the actions, I must calibrate the camera for each distinct image (v17, v18, v19, v20). Given the constraints on movement, all these actions will be performed from the current position `v15`, assuming all associated locations can be interpreted from this position. The sequence is as follows for *each* image: calibrate, take, then send.
           
           For the rock analysis, I will also leverage rover `v14`. This task involves using my sample store to gather samples and send the analysis to the lander. The store has to be free at the end, so I must `drop_rock` after sending the analysis to clear my store. Similarly, the rocks are analyzed from current position `v15`. The process: sample a rock, then send the analysis, and clear the sample store. This is done for all six rocks.
           
           The crucial observation is that because movement is almost entirely restricted to self-loops, all spatial/ray parameters and locations in the problem *must* be interpreted as equivalent to my current position. Any movement out of that state would be impossible under the provided constraints. So, I must interpret all relevant objects and continuous parameters such as camera configuration and visible locations to be within my current frame of reference.
           
           This plan guarantees success under the core assumption of continuous parameters, ensuring all prerequisites are met to realize the final conjunction: `atconf`, `free`, `receivedimage`, and `receivedanalysis`.

Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable with Current Actions**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a fresh set of valid actions, which is good. The previous plan failed, as expected, since it relied on actions no longer permitted. Now I'm dealing with `move` and `drop_rock` actions: `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))`, `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`, `((drop_rock v12 v16))`, and `((drop_rock v14 v16))`.
           
           The target state is, essentially, having confirmed positions for two rocks and having received analysis reports and images for a variety of objects. More specifically, I need `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)`, and several `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           
           First, the simple stuff: `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, and `free(v14, v16)` are all true in the initial state. Great. No problem there.
           
           The tricky part comes with the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` conditions. I need images for some objects, `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedimage(v20, v11)`, and analysis results, `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for rocks of type `v2` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for rocks of type `v6`.
           
           Now, looking at my available actions, `move` doesn't do anything for these predicates; it only changes location. `drop_rock` affects the "free" status, but those conditions are already satisfied. I'm stuck, there's simply no way to change the values of `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` with the actions I have. There's no equivalent of a `send_image` or `send_analysis` action available.
           
           The goal *is not* achievable with the available actions. I should communicate this and outline the reasoning for the conclusion.
