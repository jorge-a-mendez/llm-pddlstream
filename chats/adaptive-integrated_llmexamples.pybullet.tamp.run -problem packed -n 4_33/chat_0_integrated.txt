           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.049, -0.438), (0.045, -0.344)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.175, 0.168), (0.271, 0.263)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.122, -0.47), (0.209, -0.383)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.174, 0.397), (0.268, 0.492)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.002, -0.391, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.852, 0.523).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.223, 0.215, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.865, 0.503).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.166, -0.426, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.799, 0.601).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.221, 0.444, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.859, 0.512).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem requires us to place four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) onto the surface v18.
           The current state shows that v8, v12, v14, and v16 are supported on v11 at different poses.
           The available action instances only include a `move_base` action that moves the robot from v3 to v3, which means the robot doesn't move. There are no pick or place actions listed in the available action instances. This means the robot cannot interact with any objects. Without pick and place actions, the robot cannot move any of the objects, and thus cannot satisfy the `on` predicate for v18. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
