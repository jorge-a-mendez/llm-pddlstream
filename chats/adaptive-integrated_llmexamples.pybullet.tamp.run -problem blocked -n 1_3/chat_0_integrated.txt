           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.418, 0.232), (-4.329, 0.32)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.374, 0.276, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.988, 0.156).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom for `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. In the initial state, we have objects `v12` and `v8` of type `v17`. We also have `v15` which is stackable. The axiom states that `green` must be on `v18`. We also have the predicates `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. This implies we need to place either `v12` or `v8` at `#o2` on `v18`. Since there are no pick and place actions available and only a move_base action, and the `on` predicate needs `atpose`, we must use an object already at `v18` or `v10` by default. Given the axiom, we need to achieve `on(?green, v18)` where `?green` is of `type(?green, v17)`. `v12` and `v8` are of type `v17`. The state has `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. However, there are no actions for placing objects and no valid pick/place actions in the list. The only available action is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. Since the goal requires an object to be on `v18` and no pick/place actions are available to move objects onto `v18`, the goal cannot be achieved from the initial state. The initial state doesn't have any object of type v17 on v18.
           
           This problem is impossible. No pick or place actions are given, only a `move_base` action that goes from `v3` to `v3`. This action changes nothing related to the goal.
           
           The given action list is very restrictive, with only one `move_base` action that doesn't change the state in any meaningful way. There are no `pick` or `place` actions that would allow the robot to manipulate objects and achieve the `on` predicate. Thus, the goal cannot be achieved.
