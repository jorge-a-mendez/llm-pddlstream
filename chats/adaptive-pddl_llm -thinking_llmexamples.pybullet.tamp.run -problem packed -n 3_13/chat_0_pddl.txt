           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Infeasibility of the Plan**
           
           My immediate objective is to devise a plan to arrange `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` on `v16`.  Essentially, I need to get each object `on` to `v16`.  This translates to ensuring that each object is both *supported* by `v16` and occupies a specific *pose* on it.
           
           Analyzing the initial state, I see the following:
           *   `v8` is on `v11` at pose `v9`.
           *   `v12` is on `v11` at pose `v13`.
           *   `v14` is on `v11` at pose `v15`.
           
           The most logical approach is to: 1) pick each object from `v11`, and 2) place them on `v16`.  This requires `pick` and `place` actions that I'll need to define through the initial and goal states.
           
           However, the key constraint emerges from the list of permitted *action instances*. The ONLY allowed action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This means the robot's base can't move, which should be fine. However it also means it's strictly limited to that one base movement action and is not capable of picking up or placing anything.
           
           To utilize pick, I would need to find pick actions for each object that would also align with preconditions. However, I can't find valid action instances in the provided information.
           
           Thus, given the constraint of only a `move_base` action instance being valid, achieving the desired object configuration is impossible.  I am constrained and thus can't generate the plan needed to meet the objective.
