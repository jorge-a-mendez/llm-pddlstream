           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Impasse**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a clear goal: getting `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all stacked on `v16`.  I've got the initial state facts, which tell me these objects are currently on `v11`.  My thought process is to use the `pick` and `place` actions to move these items onto the target surface, `v16`.
           
           My understanding of the situation starts with analyzing the initial state. I have two arms available, `v4` and `v6`, both empty. The objects are graspable and currently at specific poses.  I see there is a target pose, `#o2`, which can work. Based on the supported facts, placing the objects at `#o2` will satisfy the `on` goal condition. I know `stackable` facts exist, which confirms `v16` is a valid target surface for all three objects.
           
           However, here's where things get tricky.  I meticulously reviewed the facts and the available action instances, which is just one: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action seems to indicate no actual movement of the base.
           
           The critical issue is the lack of any `pick` or `place` action instances. The rules clearly state that only allowed action instances can be used.  Without `pick` and `place`, I'm completely stuck! I'm trying to find an indirect way, but I see no way around this.
           
           Even if I could use `pick` and `place` with the available base motion, the `NegatedAtom` and `Atom` effects for base movement would cancel each other out, making this move no-op.
           
           Given the strict constraint that I can only use this one `move_base` action instance, I have to conclude that the goal is currently unreachable.  There's no way to manipulate the objects into the desired state without the appropriate `pick` and `place` actions, or any action that would result in those objects being placed.
