User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.206, 0.3), (0.3, 0.393)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.242, 0.248), (-0.157, 0.333)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.086, 0.221), (0.013, 0.319)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.205, -0.324), (0.291, -0.238)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.253, 0.347, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.976, -0.22).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.2, 0.291, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.993, 0.121).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.036, 0.27, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.913, 0.408).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.248, -0.281, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.796, 0.605).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment: Impossibility of Achieving the Object Placement Goal**
           
           Okay, here's my understanding. I'm given a scenario where I need to move four objects, identified as `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`, from their current location on surface `v11` to the surface `v18`. I can see the initial state shows that all objects are currently supported by v11, expressed as `on(object, v11)`. The desired end state is simply the mirror image of this: `on(object, v18)`.
           
           My initial thought is to execute a plan that involves picking each object from v11 and placing it on v18. However, the action instances I'm given are limited to `move_base`. This particular `move_base` function does nothing other than move the base of the robot around. It doesn't actually affect the state of the objects in the world.
           
           Looking closer, I can see that `on` is derived from `supported` and `atpose` predicates. To move the objects, I'd need to change their `atpose` in a way that matches the `supported` relation with `v18`. I see how this would normally be done with typical robotic manipulation: `pick` and `place` actions that modify the object's pose. But, there are no `pick` or `place` actions available!
           
           Given that I can only execute `move_base`, which by definition doesn't alter the pose of any objects, I have to conclude that the goal is currently unreachable. There is simply no available means to directly modify the states of the target objects.
