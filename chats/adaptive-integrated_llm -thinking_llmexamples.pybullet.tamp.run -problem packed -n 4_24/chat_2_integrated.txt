           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.206, 0.3), (0.3, 0.393)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.242, 0.248), (-0.157, 0.333)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.086, 0.221), (0.013, 0.319)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.205, -0.324), (0.291, -0.238)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.253, 0.347, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.976, -0.22).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.2, 0.291, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.993, 0.121).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.036, 0.27, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.913, 0.408).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.248, -0.281, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.796, 0.605).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **The Path to Placement: A Robot's Plan**
           
           I've been tasked with a straightforward manipulation problem: move four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) from their current perch on surface v11 to a new home on surface v18. The robot's got a single arm (v4) to do the job, and the initial state indicates it's handempty and at bconf v3. My goal is to craft a plan, specifically using action sequences to successfully perform the pick and place operation.
           
           The core of the strategy is clear: pick each object up from v11 and place it onto v18. Each `atpose` of objects is at pose v9, v13, v15, and v17 respectively, and the plan requires that I manipulate them to be at an identical pose, #o2. The robot's kinematic capabilities are defined by "kin" facts for a range of picking and placing poses, and this indicates that the robot is capable.  The goal is to ensure a final state of the form `on(obj, v18)` for each object. The goal means I need all four objects to have a `supported` fact with `v18` and a `pose` with `#o2`.
           
           Because there are "supported" facts for each object on v18 already for *this* pose, I can now define it. There is one key: since the system states that objects must occupy distinct positions on `v18`. I must ensure that #o2 takes different values for each object placement!
           
           The system provides `kin` predicates for the arm interacting with the objects at each step. Also, the system says the base needs to be configured at #o3 to work. There are pre-defined actions for pick and place; therefore the algorithm is to move from the base `v3` to the base `#o3`. Then, perform the necessary pick and place actions.
           
           The actions are defined:
           1.  `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)` Move the base.
           2.  `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           3.  `(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           4.  `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           5.  `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           6.  `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           7.  `(place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           8.  `(pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           9.  `(place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           
           Now comes the tricky part:  I need to provide distinct continuous values for `#o2` for each object's placement because that pose is present in the initial condition. After that, pick and place must be repeated for all four objects. The *plan* will have the same structure for each object.
           
           Since `v18` is of the form `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))` and `v11` is of the form `((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6))`. The four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) are to be placed, and based on their poses in `v11` as `(0.253, 0.347, 0.781)`, `(-0.036, 0.27, 0.781)`, `(-0.2, 0.291, 0.781)`, `(0.248, -0.281, 0.781)`. Given that the base is at `(-1.0, 0.0, 0.0)` which is far away from the objects, the best approach is to place the objects in the target locations. I will also have to select values of the same z height:  0.781, and place them along the plane, with x and y values in the following pattern:
           1.  For `v8` at (0.05, 0.05, 0.781)
           2.  For `v12` at (-0.05, 0.05, 0
