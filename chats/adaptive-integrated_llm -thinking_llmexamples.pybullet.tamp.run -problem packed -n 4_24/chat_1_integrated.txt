User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.206, 0.3), (0.3, 0.393)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.242, 0.248), (-0.157, 0.333)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.086, 0.221), (0.013, 0.319)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.205, -0.324), (0.291, -0.238)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.253, 0.347, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.976, -0.22).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.2, 0.291, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.993, 0.121).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.036, 0.27, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.913, 0.408).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.248, -0.281, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.796, 0.605).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **The Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to move these four objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) onto the surface v18. The robot has two arms, but the information indicates that v4 is the relevant one for all the available kinematics.
           
           1.  **Understanding the Situation:** I'm given that all four objects are currently on surface v11 at specific poses, and the goal is to have all four objects on surface v18. The *on* predicate is crucial here, and it's derived from *supported* and *atpose*.  This means I need to find valid support poses on v18 and then move each object there.
           
           2.  **Surface Analysis:**  I've checked the initial state and all four objects, specifically v8, v12, v14, and v16, are supported by v18. The problem statement gives me some information about the continuous poses using '#o2'. It also states I need to assign distinct continuous poses for each object to satisfy the given condition. The *atbconf(v3)* is given, and all the relevant predicates (kin, pick, place) also use *v3* for base configuration.
           
           3.  **Plan Overview:** I'll use a straightforward pick-and-place approach, iterating through each object.  For each object:
           
               *   Pick it up from its current location.
               *   Place it onto v18 at a new, distinct pose.
           
           4.  **Detailed Plan:**
           
               *   **Object v8:**
                   *   Pick from v9.
                   *   Place on v18 at pose defined as `#o2 v8 v18` as a distinct continuous value.
               *   **Object v12:**
                   *   Pick from v13.
                   *   Place on v18 at pose defined as `#o2 v12 v18` as a distinct continuous value.
               *   **Object v14:**
                   *   Pick from v15.
                   *   Place on v18 at pose defined as `#o2 v14 v18` as a distinct continuous value.
               *   **Object v16:**
                   *   Pick from v17.
                   *   Place on v18 at pose defined as `#o2 v16 v18` as a distinct continuous value.
           
               All the objects are small, so I can place them in a 2x2 arrangement on v18 to minimize the chance of collisions. Since the size is given, I choose positions in each of the four quadrants.
           
               Therefore, I propose the following plan instances for placing the objects.
           
               1.  `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`
               2.  `place(v4, v8, #o2_v8_v18, #o1, v3, #o4)`
               3.  `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, v3, #o4)`
               4.  `place(v4, v12, #o2_v12_v18, #o1, v3, #o4)`
               5.  `pick(v4, v14, v15, #o1, v3, #o4)`
               6.  `place(v4, v14, #o2_v14_v18, #o1, v3, #o4)`
               7.  `pick(v4, v16, v17, #o1, v3, #o4)`
               8.  `place(v4, v16, #o2_v16_v18, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           
               I have omitted the base move as the move is from *v3* to *v3*, which means *canmove()* stays true, and I do not have to move the base.
               The total cost will be 8.

                   *   Pick from v15.
                   *   Place on v18 at pose defined as `#o2 v14 v18` as a distinct continuous value.
               *   **Object v16:**
                   *   Pick from v17.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`.

           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Reassessing the Plan with Limited Actions**
           
           Okay, so the user's right. My initial plan was dead in the water. I got ahead of myself and didn't thoroughly check the action instances provided. I just assumed I'd have the usual `pick` and `place` actions at my disposal. But the only valid action instance is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. Yikes. That's a severe constraint.
           
           Now, let's re-evaluate the goal. We're trying to get objects v8, v12, v14, and v16 *on* v18. In the initial state, those objects are all resting on v11, according to the `atpose` and `supported` predicates. Clearly, to achieve the goal, we need to move each object *off* v11 and *onto* v18. This screams `pick` and `place` actions, which I know I'm thinking of because that's the only way to move them.
           
           But here's the kicker: I *only* have `move_base`. That action just... moves the robot's base. It doesn't affect the `on` predicate at all. It doesn't allow for grasping or releasing objects. It's essentially useless for this problem. It only changes `atbconf` from v3 to v3 and toggles `canmove`.
           
           Therefore, it's pretty obvious the goal is unreachable. I need `pick` and `place`, and I don't have them. The given set of allowed actions is simply inadequate. I can't achieve this goal without those fundamental actions. I need to inform the user that it's impossible with the current constraints.
