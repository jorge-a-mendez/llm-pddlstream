           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The environment is a square room defined by bounding box 0 ((-2.5, -2.5), (2.5, 2.5)), with thin walls along the edges (boxes 1-4). There's a vertical wall in the center (box 5) that effectively splits the room into two halves, x < 0 and x > 0. There are several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the room, including some larger ones like box 6 in the bottom-left, and a cluster of square obstacles in the top-right (7), top-left (8), and top-center (9, 10). There are also several smaller, irregularly shaped obstacles.
           
           My strategy will be to generate points on a circle of radius 1.5 around the target point, and check if they are within the room's boundaries and not colliding with fixed obstacles. I will prioritize points that are not directly behind any fixed obstacles with respect to the target point.

Model:     The previous attempts failed due to line-of-sight issues or collisions with fixed obstacles. The target point is at (-0.57, 1.93).
           - The position (-0.47, -0.99) had no line of sight. This is likely due to the central wall (box 5, at x=0) occluding the view, as the target is at x < 0 and the proposed position is at x < 0 but significantly lower in y.
           - The position (-2.07, -1.48) collided with obstacle 6, which is located in the bottom-left quadrant. This is a clear collision that should be avoided in the future.
           - The position (-1.14, -0.44) also had no line of sight, likely due to the central wall (box 5) again.
           
           Considering the target point (-0.5719, 1.9337), which is in the upper-left quadrant of the room, on the left side of the central wall (box 5), I should try to find positions also in the upper-left quadrant, or at least on the same side of the central wall. I will prioritize points that are close to the target point, within the max_range of 2. I'll also try to keep a safe distance from known obstacles like box 6.

Model:     The new target point is (2.135, 1.977). This is in the upper-right quadrant of the room.
           Looking at the previous failures, the positions (-1.57, 1.93), (-0.57, 0.93), and (-2.07, 1.93) all failed for the new target. This is expected as these positions were on the left side of the central wall (box 5, x=0), while the new target is on the right side. The central wall would have occluded the view. Additionally, (-2.07, 1.93) collided with obstacles 8 and 19 which are in the top-left area. This confirms that I should stick to the side of the central wall where the target is located.
           
           For the current target (2.135, 1.977), I will focus on the right side of the central wall (x > 0). The target is near the top-right corner. Obstacles in this area include 7 ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)), which is a square obstacle very close to the target. This means I need to be careful with positions that are too close or directly behind this obstacle. Also, obstacle 21 ((2.08, 1.92), (2.18, 2.02)) is very close to the target point. This means that positions directly behind the target will likely collide with one of these obstacles or lose line of sight.
           
           I will try positions in the vicinity of the target, but not directly on top of or behind known obstacles. I will try to place the robot to the left or below the target, within the x > 0 region.
