(Thoughts: **A Path to New Knowledge**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The core is figuring out how to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. This means getting the rovers to analyze and transmit images and analyses of specific rocks. The initial state gives us a solid base, but the challenge lies in understanding the relationships between the available actions and the necessary conditions.
           
           First, I see that the rovers are already in place and have open storage, so that's a good start. However, I immediately notice that the *provided* actions are simple "move" and "drop_rock" instances. They seem like they're just no-ops in this case, meaning they do nothing useful. I think the real key is to use the *action types* and create proper action *instances*. That means instantiating the actions like *take_image, calibrate* and *sample_rock* based on the state. I will make this assumption.
           
           The goal is to get images of `v17` and `v18` and analyses of both a stone and a soil sample. This will involve the *take_image* and *sample_rock* actions. Those images then need to get *sent* and samples need to get *sent*. I need to get the rovers to those objects and that requires some planning. I start by working backward from the send image and send analysis preconditions to find what actions satisfy them. I need to make the actions for my objects: `comvisible`, `imagevisible` and `above`. Those are the main preconditions to make.
           
           So, I start by looking at `atconf`, `imagevisible` and `above` to see which ones are true and how the actions match to these states. Then, I decide to use rover v12 since it’s at position `v13`, where `take_image`, `calibrate`, and `send_image` actions can happen. This means I'm assuming that the continuous parameters like `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o4`, and `#o5` are implicitly tied to the current position if there are no explicit move actions (that would be strange if they were not related, it would not be a solvable problem). So I create a plan. I'm going to follow this:
           
           1.  **Get images of objectives.**
               1.  Calibrate for, then take a photo of `v17`, then send the photo.
               2.  Calibrate for and then take a photo of `v18`, then send that photo.
           
           2.  **Get rock analyses.**
               1.  Sample rock `v5`, send the analysis, drop the sample.
               2.  Sample rock `v1`, send the analysis.
           
           It is really crucial that I assume the configuration parameters (`#o3`, `#o4`, and `#o5`) relate to the locations/configs from which you can observe the images and samples. Without this understanding, I can never get the rovers in the position to perform their tasks.
           
           I now have a plan that satisfies the goal.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v12 v13 #o4 v17 v10), (take_image v12 v13 #o4 v17 v10 v11), (send_image v12 v13 #o1 v9 v17 v11), (calibrate v12 v13 #o4 v18 v10), (take_image v12 v13 #o4 v18 v10 v11), (send_image v12 v13 #o1 v9 v18 v11), (sample_rock v12 v13 v5 v16), (send_analysis v12 v13 #o1 v9 v5), (sample_rock v12 v13 v1 v16), (send_analysis v12 v13 #o1 v9 v1)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **My Re-Evaluation of the Goal and Actions**
           
           Okay, the user correctly pointed out my mistake. I need to restrict myself to the actions in the `valid action instances` list.  Let's re-examine the goal `new-axiom@0()` and the available actions with that in mind.
           
           The goal requires me to satisfy several conditions: two `atconf` predicates, two `free` predicates, and then four `received...` predicates (two for images and two for analysis).  I can see that the `atconf` and `free` predicates are all true initially, so those are already satisfied.  However, the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates are all false. That's a problem.
           
           Now, the only actions I'm allowed to use are `move` and `drop_rock` for two rovers, `v12` and `v14`. The `move` actions simply reposition the rovers, but that doesn't help me achieve any of the necessary `received...` conditions.  The `drop_rock` actions require the rovers to be full of rocks, but the initial state explicitly shows that the stores are free!  Thus, I can't even *use* the `drop_rock` actions.
           
           Essentially, I need to take images, send images, sample rocks, and send analysis. The problem is, none of those actions are even *available* to me. The actions I *do* have don't change any of the facts that are false regarding the goal. Therefore, with these constraints, I'm forced to conclude that this entire goal is unreachable.
