User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Strategic Base Placement for Optimal Robot Performance**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with devising 25 strategic positions for a robot's base, all while considering a few constraints: the base must be within 4 units of a given target point, restricted to the x and y limits of -2.5 to 2.5, avoid fixed obstacles, and maintain a clear line of sight to the target. It's like a game of spatial planning, and my expertise comes into play here.
           
           First, I need to understand the playing field. I'm provided with the layout of the environment, specifically in the form of AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) representing obstacles. This includes the outer walls, the crucial central wall along x=0, and a collection of smaller obstacles. These objects dictate the viable regions for the base.
           
           My approach is systematic: I'll generate candidate positions around the target point using a spiral or circular pattern. This ensures that I cover a range of distances and angles, maximizing potential viewpoints. Each proposed position gets a thorough inspection to ensure it adheres to the constraints: is it within range, not encroaching on any obstacles, and most importantly, does it have an unobstructed view of the target? I'm essentially playing a game of 'would you be able to see the target from that spot?'
           
           Line of sight is the trickiest aspect, and my plan is to avoid obstructions. I want the base to be on the same side of the central wall as the target or close to an edge, so this wall, given its position along x=0, is key. If the target is on one side, placing the base on the other could be blocked. I use a heuristic: if they're on opposite sides, consider it a no-go.  Also, it would not be desirable to have the base *inside* or very close to any obstacles.  I have my own internal data, so if feedback informs me of problems, I'm ready to learn and refine my model.
           
           If my initial attempts fall short of the required 25 positions, I'll switch gears, employing a denser grid-based search to find more viable candidates.  Ultimately, I'm committed to delivering the required positions, even if it means employing backup strategies like small perturbations of good positions or, in a very unlikely worst-case scenario, adding positions that might be sub-optimal if the constraints are too rigid.  In these last cases I will be sure to inform the feedback loop of any potential issues, so the model learns.  The ultimate aim is to give a set of base positions that are both diverse and, as far as I can ascertain, offer a clear path to the target.
