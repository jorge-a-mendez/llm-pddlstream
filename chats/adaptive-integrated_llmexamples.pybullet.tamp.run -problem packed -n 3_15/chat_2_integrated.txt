User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.185, 0.452, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.918, 0.398).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.118, -0.455, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.755, 0.656).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.181, -0.405), (-0.106, -0.329)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.136, 0.402), (0.235, 0.501)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.144, -0.367, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.039, 0.999).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.079, -0.495), (0.158, -0.416)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is to place objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` on surface `v16`. Currently, `v12` is at `v13` (on `v11`), `v8` is at `v9` (on `v11`), and `v14` is at `v15` (on `v11`). `v16` is a stackable surface. The robot arm `v4` is `handempty` and at `v5`. The base is at `v3`.
           
           The plan will involve picking each object and placing it on `v16`. Since `v16` is a dummy surface (no continuous value is provided for it), any collision-free placement on `v11` is acceptable for a pose named `#o2`. I will calculate the poses of `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` such that they are placed on `v11` (which acts as a stand-in for `v16` since `v16` is a dummy surface and `v11` is not). These poses must be distinct and non-colliding.
           
           I will iterate through the objects, pick them up, and then place them on `v16` (represented by `v11` at distinct locations).
           
           First, pick `v12` from `v13`.
           Then, place `v12` at a new pose `#o2` on `v16` (using `v11` as the surface).
           Next, pick `v8` from `v9`.
           Then, place `v8` at a new pose `#o2` on `v16` (using `v11` as the surface).
           Finally, pick `v14` from `v15`.
           Then, place `v14` at a new pose `#o2` on `v16` (using `v11` as the surface).

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('supported', v12, #o2, v16) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The previous plan failed because the `supported` predicate for `#o2` was not explicitly set for `v16`. Since `v16` is a dummy surface, the plan should explicitly state that the object `v12` will be supported by `v16` at `#o2`, `v8` will be supported by `v16` at `#o2`, and `v14` will be supported by `v16` at `#o2`. I will calculate the poses of `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` such that they are placed on `v11` (which acts as a stand-in for `v16` since `v16` is a dummy surface and `v11` is not). These poses must be distinct and non-colliding. The goal is to place all three objects on `v16`.
           
           First, I will pick up `v12` from its initial position `v13`.
           Then, I will place `v12` at a new pose `#o2` on `v16`. Since `v16` is a dummy surface, I will place it on `v11` at a suitable location.
           Next, I will pick up `v8` from its initial position `v9`.
           Then, I will place `v8` at a new pose `#o2` on `v16`. Again, using `v11` as the stand-in surface and a new location.
           Finally, I will pick up `v14` from its initial position `v15`.
           Then, I will place `v14` at a new pose `#o2` on `v16`, using `v11` as the stand-in surface and a third new location.

Model:     The previous plans failed because the `supported` predicate was not explicitly satisfied for the target surface `v16` and the generated `#o2` poses. I need to make sure that for each object placed at `#o2`, it is explicitly stated that it is supported by `v16`. Since `v16` is a dummy surface and `v11` is the only concrete surface, I will place all objects on `v11` at distinct locations, and for the `supported` predicate, I will list `v16` as the supporting surface, since that is what the goal specifies.
           
           Here's the refined plan:
           1. Pick `v12` from its current pose `v13`.
           2. Place `v12` at a new pose `#o2` on surface `v16`. This pose will be defined to be on `v11` since `v16` is a dummy surface.
           3. Pick `v8` from its current pose `v9`.
           4. Place `v8` at a new pose `#o2` on surface `v16`. This pose will be defined to be on `v11` at a different location.
           5. Pick `v14` from its current pose `v15`.
           6. Place `v14` at a new pose `#o2` on surface `v16`. This pose will be defined to be on `v11` at yet another different location.

User:      Pose #o2 = (0.1 0.1 0.781 0.0) for object v8 on surface v16 is not stable, as the 2D AABB of the object (AABB(lower=(0.06500000149011612, 0.06500000149011612), upper=(0.13500000149011612, 0.13500000149011612))) is not contained in the 2D AABB of the surface (AABB(lower=(-0.135, -0.135), upper=(0.135, 0.135))). Make sure your poses are in the format `(<x> <y> <z> <theta>)`.
           Pose #o2 = (-0.1 -0.1 0.781 0.0) for object v14 on surface v16 is not stable, as the 2D AABB of the object (AABB(lower=(-0.13500000149011612, -0.13500000149011612), upper=(-0.06500000149011612, -0.06500000149011612))) is not contained in the 2D AABB of the surface (AABB(lower=(-0.135, -0.135), upper=(0.135, 0.135))). Make sure your poses are in the format `(<x> <y> <z> <theta>)`.
           Please provide a plan and poses that achieves the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all poses are valid and stable.

Model:     The previous plan failed due to unstable poses. I need to ensure that the 2D AABB of the object is contained within the 2D AABB of the surface `v16`. Since `v16` has AABB `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`, and the objects are `v8` (AABB = `((-0.181, -0.405), (-0.106, -0.329))`), `v12` (AABB = `((0.079, -0.495), (0.158, -0.416))`), and `v14` (AABB = `((0.136, 0.402), (0.235, 0.501))`), I must carefully choose the x, y coordinates for `#o2` so that the objects are within the bounds of `v16`. Also, since `v16` is a dummy surface, the `z` coordinate will be relative to the surface on which `v16` is "supported" (or rather, where its geometry is implicitly placed). I will use `v11` (AABB `((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6))`) as the actual surface for placement, ensuring the object's AABB lies within `v11`'s AABB, and then specifying `v16` in the `supported` predicate for the output. The `z` coordinate will be `0.781` (same as other poses on `v11`).
           
           Here's the refined plan:
           1. Pick `v12` from its current pose `v13`.
           2. Place `v12` at a new pose `#o2` on surface `v16`. I will calculate a stable pose for `v12` within `v16`'s bounds (using `v11` for collision checking).
           3. Pick `v8` from its current pose `v9`.
           4. Place `v8` at a new pose `#o2` on surface `v16`. I will calculate a stable pose for `v8` within `v16`'s bounds (using `v11` for collision checking).
           5. Pick `v14` from its current pose `v15`.
           6. Place `v14` at a new pose `#o2` on surface `v16`. I will calculate a stable pose for `v14` within `v16`'s bounds (using `v11` for collision checking).
           
           For stability with `v16` (AABB = `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`), I will place the objects near the center of `v16`. Given the sizes of the objects, it will be hard to fit all of them entirely within the given AABB of `v16`. However, I must ensure that the object's AABB is contained *within* the surface's AABB.
           For `v8` (AABB = `((-0.181, -0.405), (-0.106, -0.329))`), which has a width of `0.075` and length `0.076`, a pose like `(0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)` would center it. The center of `v8`'s initial AABB is `(-0.1435, -0.367)`. A new center needs to be within `(-0.135 + 0.075/2, 0.135 - 0.075/2)` for x, and similarly for y. So `x` must be in `(-0.0975, 0.0975)` and `y` must be in `(-0.097, 0.097)`.
           For `v12` (AABB = `((0.079, -0.495), (0.158, -0.416))`), width `0.079` and length `0.079`. Center is `(0.1185, -0.4555)`. Stable x must be in `(-0.0955, 0.0955)` and y in `(-0.0955, 0.0955)`.
           For `v14` (AABB = `((0.136, 0.402), (0.235, 0.501))`), width `0.099` and length `0.099`. Center is `(0.1855, 0.4515)`. Stable x must be in `(-0.0855, 0.0855)` and y in `(-0.0855, 0.0855)`.
           
           I will choose small offsets from the center of `v16` for placing the objects.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', v30) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     My apologies. I made a mistake in previous responses by using `#o3` which represents a base configuration, but the plan was using `v30` which is not a valid base configuration. The problem states `bconf(#o3)` and `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)`, meaning `#o3` is a valid base configuration to move to from `v3`, and `v3` is the initial base configuration. The provided action instances only allow kinematically valid picks and places with base config `#o3`. Therefore, I must move the base to `#o3` before picking or placing any object.
           
           Here's the corrected plan:
           1. Move the base from `v3` to `#o3`.
           2. Pick `v12` from its current pose `v13`.
           3. Place `v12` at a new pose `#o2` on surface `v16`. I will recalculate a stable pose for `v12` within `v16`'s bounds.
           4. Pick `v8` from its current pose `v9`.
           5. Place `v8` at a new pose `#o2` on surface `v16`. I will recalculate a stable pose for `v8` within `v16`'s bounds.
           6. Pick `v14` from its current pose `v15`.
           7. Place `v14` at a new pose `#o2` on surface `v16`. I will recalculate a stable pose for `v14` within `v16`'s bounds.
           
           I will ensure stability of the poses within `v16`'s AABB `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           For `v8` (AABB = `((-0.181, -0.405), (-0.106, -0.329))`), if centered at `(x, y)`, its bounds would be `(x-0.0375, x+0.0375)` and `(y-0.038, y+0.038)`.
           For `v12` (AABB = `((0.079, -0.495), (0.158, -0.416))`), if centered at `(x, y)`, its bounds would be `(x-0.0395, x+0.0395)` and `(y-0.0395, y+0.0395)`.
           For `v14` (AABB = `((0.136, 0.402), (0.235, 0.501))`), if centered at `(x, y)`, its bounds would be `(x-0.0495, x+0.0495)` and `(y-0.0495, y+0.0495)`.
           
           The `v16` surface AABB is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           To ensure containment, for `v8` (width ~0.075, length ~0.076), the center `x` can range from `-0.135 + 0.0375 = -0.0975` to `0.135 - 0.0375 = 0.0975`.
           For `v12` (width ~0.079, length ~0.079), the center `x` can range from `-0.135 + 0.0395 = -0.0955` to `0.135 - 0.0395 = 0.0955`.
           For `v14` (width ~0.099, length ~0.099), the center `x` can range from `-0.135 + 0.0495 = -0.0855` to `0.135 - 0.0495 = 0.0855`.
           
           I will try to place them at distinct small offsets from the center of `v16`.
