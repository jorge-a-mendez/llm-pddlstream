           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.185, 0.452, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.918, 0.398).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.136, 0.402), (0.235, 0.501)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.118, -0.455, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.755, 0.656).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.144, -0.367, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.039, 0.999).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.181, -0.405), (-0.106, -0.329)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.079, -0.495), (0.158, -0.416)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is to place objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` on `v16`. Currently, `v8` is on `v11` (at pose `v9`), `v12` is on `v11` (at pose `v13`), and `v14` is on `v11` (at pose `v15`).
           However, the initial state only provides one action instance, `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not move any objects, and thus, the goal of placing objects on `v16` cannot be achieved. The provided action `move_base` only allows moving the robot base from `v3` to `v3` with a trajectory `#o0`. This will not help in achieving the goal of placing objects on `v16`. There are no pick or place actions available to manipulate the objects.
