User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment & Strategy for Finding Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, so I've got this target point, and I need to come up with three possible spots for the robot to stand, all within a certain range (max 2 units) and making sure we can "see" the target.  The robot's always going to be facing the target, so that's a plus. The hard part is avoiding collisions with these fixed obstacles and making sure we've got a clear line of sight.
           
           First, I need to understand what's in the way.  I've got a list of these rectangular areas (AABBs), and they seem to define the walls and some other objects in the room. I'm going to start by getting a mental picture of the room layout, noting the position of the walls and that central pillar at `x=0` because that's likely going to be the biggest problem.  It looks like I need to stay within an inner box of about `(-2.4, -2.4)` to `(2.4, 2.4)` to be safe from the walls.
           
           Next, I need to figure out where the robot *can* go.  It has to be within two units of the target and not smack into anything.  I'm thinking of a circle around the target point, but also being careful about those walls.
           
           The trick is finding a diverse set of positions that are spread out, ideally on opposite sides of the central pillar if possible. I will prioritize open spaces, especially those that are not immediately adjacent to any known obstacles.  I will be doing a mental simulation of a proposed point and target to check that the path to the target does not intersect any of the AABBs.
           
           Now, for *this* specific target, `(-0.165, -0.525)`, things get interesting.  I've realized that the target point itself is *inside* one of the fixed obstacles!  That's a tricky situation.  If the definition of "line-of-sight" is completely strict, it might be impossible to achieve it, because the target *itself* is in the way.  However, I've got to find *something*.
           
           Based on the instructions I will assume the program will check the "surface" to target, or other scenarios for it to be reachable.
           
           With this in mind, here are my three robot positions, all roughly 1.5 units from the target:
           
           1.  **To the Left:** `(-1.665, -0.525)`.  This puts the robot to the left of the target, and on the same side of the pillar. This line is clear.
           2.  **Above:** `(-0.165, 0.975)`. This is right above the target, so clear and easy to aim.
           3.  **Below:** `(-0.165, -2.025)`. This robot position is located right below the target. It's to the right of obstacle 6, the main vertical block.
           
           These choices are diverse, and should minimize any collision concerns. While the situation is not ideal, they fulfill all constraints as best as possible.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Request Analysis and Strategy for Re-Entry:**
           
           I've been given a second chance, the same target point, and I need to improve. The feedback showed I completely misunderstood the input format last time, using `(-0.165, -0.525)` instead of the correct target point `(-1.825, 2.05)`. This is a critical error.
           
           **Key Insight:**  It appears that the target point is *inside* a fixed obstacle (Obstacle 19). This changes everything. Direct "line of sight" is probably impossible.  My strategy is to find placements that are valid (no collision) and as close as possible to the target's "neighborhood" --  close enough to potentially "see" and/or move toward the target if a non-fixed obstacle blocks the way. My radius of the robot will be 0.1 for now, for safe placement.
           
           **Revised Strategy for this Request:**
           1.  **Placement Validation:** Ensure the chosen robot base does not collide with any fixed obstacles (walls, pillar).
           2.  **Range Check:**  Keep the robot center within a maximum distance of 2 from the target.
           3.  **Pathfinding for Best Path:**  Attempt to position robot along the edges of the targeted area to avoid hitting obstacles, in case the user's software checks that line of sight (LOS) doesn't pass through a known fixed obstacle even if inside it.
           4.  **No Obstacles!**  I will make sure the range of x: [-2.4, 0.175] and y: [-2.4, 2.4].
               I will try:
               1.  `(-1.825, 1.0)`: Below Obs 8/10/19. Valid placement, dist 1.05.
               2.  `(-1.0, 1.0)`: Right of 8/19, left of 10, below both. Valid placement, dist 1.335.
               3.  `(-2.0, 0.5)`: Valid distance of 1.559 (x and y is clear from the environment for placement).
