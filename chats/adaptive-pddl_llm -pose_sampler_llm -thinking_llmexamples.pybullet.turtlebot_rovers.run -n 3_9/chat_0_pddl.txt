           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Problem: An Unachievable Goal**
           
           My task is to create a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain.  I started by breaking down the `new-axiom@0()` definition, which requires a conjunction of several conditions.  The initial state satisfies some of these, specifically those related to the rovers' current positions and the availability of the store.  However, the critical unmet conditions are `receivedimage` for three objectives and `receivedanalysis` for both a stone and a soil sample.
           
           To achieve these, I analyzed the preconditions and effects of the relevant actions: `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`.  However, here's where the problem arises: **The list of allowed action instances is severely limited, containing only `move` and `drop_rock`.**  Crucially, none of these allowed actions can modify the state to make `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` true. The `drop_rock` action is also not applicable due to `free(rover, store)` being true in the initial state.
           
           Since the problem statement explicitly forbids the use of any action not in the given list, and the goal requires achieving `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`, which are impossible with the restricted set of actions, **I conclude that the goal is unattainable.** The provided axioms simply define the conditions, not a process for achieving them.  Therefore, no plan can be constructed to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`.
