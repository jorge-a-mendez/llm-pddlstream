User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.116, -0.287), (-0.019, -0.19)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.037, -0.324, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.203, 0.979).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.025, 0.364, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.605, 0.796).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.009, -0.37), (0.083, -0.278)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.018, 0.321), (0.068, 0.407)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.067, -0.238, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.877, -0.481).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom atbconf(v3)

           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm looking at a planning problem where the goal is to have objects v8, v12, and v14 all *on* object v16.  Specifically, this means I need to arrange them so they are *supported* by v16 in some appropriate *pose*.
           
           My initial thought is to break this down.  For each object, I need to get it to the right place:
           
           1.  Move v8 such that it is supported by v16 at a pose p_v8.
           2.  Move v12 such that it is supported by v16 at a pose p_v12.
           3.  Move v14 such that it is supported by v16 at a pose p_v14.
           
           Now, looking at the *initial state*, the objects are currently *on* v11.  They're in their own specific poses but they're *supported* by v11, not v16.  So, in theory, my plan should involve picking up each object and then placing it on v16.  Classic "pick and place" scenario.
           
           However, I've got a limited action set.  The only action instance I'm allowed to use is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This is a clear indicator that the robot is limited to simple actions, but nothing that would directly manipulate the objects.  Furthermore, the constraint on actions confirms this.
           
           Given this, I must examine the initial state against the goal. Let's see if the objects are already in the correct configurations.  Well, the initial state gives us `on(v8, v11)`, `on(v12, v11)` and `on(v14, v11)`. The goal is `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)` and `on(v14, v16)`.  Unfortunately, the initial state doesn't give us those facts.
           
           The problem, as I see it, is that `move_base` doesn't alter object states like `atpose` or `supported`. It only works with the robot's configuration. It's essentially a no-op as far as placing objects is concerned. Since the action instance doesn't allow me to pick, move or place objects, and the initial state doesn't meet the goal, *the goal is demonstrably unreachable* given the constraints.
