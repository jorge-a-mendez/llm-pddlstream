User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.009, -0.37), (0.083, -0.278)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.116, -0.287), (-0.019, -0.19)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.037, -0.324, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.203, 0.979).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.018, 0.321), (0.068, 0.407)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.067, -0.238, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.877, -0.481).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.025, 0.364, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.605, 0.796).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **The Path to Placement: A Detailed Plan**
           
           Okay, so the goal is clear: get those three objects, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, all settled neatly onto `v16`. Since all the objects can be stacked on `v16` and `v16` is the target, it shouldn't be too tricky. We'll be using arm `v4`, since it's the only arm in the `kin` predicates, with base configuration at `v3` -- it seems the robot is stuck in place.
           
           Let's break this down: It looks like our available actions are `pick`, `place`, and `move_base`. `move_base` is available, but seems unnecessary for us here. We don't need to move the robot. The most efficient way is a three pick and three place approach with arm `v4`.
           
           **Here's the plan:**
           
           1.  **Pick up `v8`**: Arm `v4` picks up object `v8` from its current pose `v9`.
           2.  **Place `v8`**: Arm `v4` places `v8` onto `v16` at a new pose which we'll call `#o2` for `v8` on `v16`.
           3.  **Pick up `v12`**: Arm `v4` picks up object `v12` from its current pose `v13`.
           4.  **Place `v12`**: Arm `v4` places `v12` onto `v16` at a new pose which we'll call `#o2` for `v12` on `v16`.
           5.  **Pick up `v14`**: Arm `v4` picks up object `v14` from its current pose `v15`.
           6.  **Place `v14`**: Arm `v4` places `v14` onto `v16` at a new pose which we'll call `#o2` for `v14` on `v16`.
           
           **Poses & Assumptions:**
           
           I'm making a few assumptions to keep this streamlined, and this should be fine.  I'll give the coordinates for where the objects will be placed on the target surface:
           
           *   For object `v14`, the plan uses the pose symbol `#o2` representing the surface.  Specifically, `(#o2 v14 v16)` has the coordinates `(-0.05, 0.05, 0.781, 0, 0, 0, 1)`.
           *   For object `v8`, the plan uses the pose symbol `#o2` representing the surface. Specifically, `(#o2 v8 v16)` has the coordinates `(0.05, 0.05, 0.781, 0, 0, 0, 1)`.
           *   For object `v12`, the plan uses the pose symbol `#o2` representing the surface. Specifically, `(#o2 v12 v16)` has the coordinates `(0, -0.05, 0.781, 0, 0, 0, 1)`.
           
           Those placements should keep the AABBs from colliding with one another.
           
           We need to keep in mind that the problem requires providing values for continuous parameters, and I'm ensuring that by selecting coordinates in the pose values.
           
           This plan hits the goal in the most direct way.  Each step's going to cost 1, so the total will be 6. I think we're set!

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a plan and it seems there's a problem. The previous attempt utilized actions that simply aren't in the permitted set. The only tool I have is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  My objective is crystal clear: to have objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all stacked atop `v16`. This means I need to manipulate these objects, which, based on my knowledge of this domain, requires `pick` and `place` actions.
           
           However, after a thorough review, I've realized the `move_base` action is essentially a non-op in this context. It doesn't allow me to pick up or put down anything. It's simply moving a base - completely irrelevant to changing the state of the objects. Since I'm limited to only the single `move_base` action, I'm completely unable to execute any kind of pick-and-place operation.
           
           Based on the preconditions and the available action, I'm forced to conclude that this goal is currently unreachable with the given constraints. The task demands the use of actions I simply don't have access to.
