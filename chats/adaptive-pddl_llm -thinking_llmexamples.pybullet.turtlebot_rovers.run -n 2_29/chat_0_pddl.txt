           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of Achieving new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, I've got this. My goal is to figure out a plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. First, I broke down the axiom and looked at each predicate. A quick check of the initial state revealed several things that I need to make true: I have to get two images (`receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`) and then somehow get an analysis for both a stone and some soil (`receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`).
           
           The plan hinges on these actions: `take_image`, `send_image`, `calibrate`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. However, upon meticulously reviewing the allowed actions, it struck me: *none* of those are in the provided list! I have `move` actions that don't even change the rovers' locations and some drop actions, which don't help at all.
           
           This means I'm stuck. The `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions, are crucial to my plan, and without them, I'm at an impasse. The other conditions for the axioms are already true initially, but these actions are what I need.
           
           After careful consideration of the actions available, it is clear that the goal is currently unachievable, because the necessary actions for achieving the relevant predicates of the goal are not available.
