User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.134, -0.376), (-0.041, -0.283)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.114, 0.205), (-0.016, 0.303)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.087, -0.33, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.976, 0.217).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.069, 0.317), (0.168, 0.415)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.065, 0.254, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.322, 0.947).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.119, 0.366, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.424, 0.906).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning for the Plan**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of my thinking: the goal is to get three objects (v8, v12, and v14) from surface v11 onto surface v16. It's pretty straightforward: I'll need to use the robot arm (v4) to pick each object up from v11 and place it onto v16.  The challenge is making sure they don't collide.
           
           The initial state says each object is *on* v11. The goal is that each object is *on* v16. I can use pick and place actions, and the kinematic facts confirm that I can pick and place these objects.
           
           Since the plan is a simple pick and place process, I'll iterate through the objects.
           
           The key to avoiding collisions is the "continuous parameter" `#o2`. This is where each object will be placed on v16. The problem *specifically* states that if multiple objects will be placed *at* the same pose (represented by a # symbol), then I have to specify a different, concrete value.
           
           I analyzed the AABBs (bounding boxes) of the objects and v16 to figure out where to place them without overlap. My analysis of the poses used showed that there's no reason to consider base movement with `move_base`. Given the lack of a moving base, and the use of the same configuration, I can assume the robot can reach the necessary locations without moving.
           
           I then chose placements on v16 that would be non-overlapping. I made sure to place the objects in a way that they would remain stable and distinct. After the placement, all the objects should have no collisions.
           
           The resulting plan will consist of a sequence of pick and place actions, each of the form: pick the object, place it on the computed location on the target surface.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of the Task**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a planning problem, and the user's initial plan was rejected.  The user's intentions seem clear: they want to achieve `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  In my initial state, I have these objects sitting on a different object `v11`, each supported and at a pose (`atpose`). It's all very standard. Also, I'm starting in an `atbconf(v3)` configuration and I'm currently allowed to `canmove()`.
           
           The plan submitted was, of course, flawed. The user has explicitly stated that only one single action instance can be used: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This is a huge problem. I'm confined to *only* moving myself *to my current location*. Effectively, I'm stuck, unable to actually achieve any meaningful change.
           
           This `move_base` action, as restricted, just resets me to my current state and then says I `cannotmove()` again.  I'm basically paralyzed. I can't interact with the objects at all. I need `pick` and `place` actions to manipulate these objects and get them where they need to be, but the user is preventing me from using those.  This restriction on available actions renders the whole goal impossible.  The "clean" and "cook" actions won't help either, as they're not useful for moving objects.
           
           The situation is clear: the only allowed action will make no difference. There is no plan that works.
