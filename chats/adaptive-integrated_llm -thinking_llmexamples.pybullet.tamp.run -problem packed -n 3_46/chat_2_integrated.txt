User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.134, -0.376), (-0.041, -0.283)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.114, 0.205), (-0.016, 0.303)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.087, -0.33, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.976, 0.217).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.069, 0.317), (0.168, 0.415)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.065, 0.254, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.322, 0.947).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.119, 0.366, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.424, 0.906).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The core of this problem is to get objects v8, v12, and v14 all *on* surface v16. That means picking them up from their current poses and placing them down at a new pose on the target surface. My initial assessment is that I need to define the continuous pose for each. 
           
           I know the robot arm v4 is currently free and its base is at v3. The base configuration for the pick and place is #o3. I can see that all the pick and place actions require the base conf to be #o3. So, I will move the robot from v3 to the #o3 base config, *then* execute the sequence of pick and place actions.
           
           The goal is achieved when `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)` are true.
           The plan breaks down like this:
           
           1.  Move the base from v3 to #o3.
           2.  Pick v8 from v9 and place it at #o2 on v16.
           3.  Pick v12 from v13 and place it at #o2 on v16.
           4.  Pick v14 from v15 and place it at #o2 on v16.
           
           For the new poses, I have to provide continuous values since this is part of the problem. Surface v16's AABB is  ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). I need a `z` value for the pick and place on this table-like surface. The starting poses of the objects have `z=0.781`, so I'll also use `z=0.781` in the target poses to maintain consistency.
           
           Now for placing on `v16`. I have to place the objects inside the AABB's range, while also avoiding overlaps and making sure they are contained in the bounds of `v16`. Here are the continuous values I will use:
           
           *   For object `v8` on `v16`: x = -0.08, y = -0.08, z = 0.781, and theta = 0.0.
           *   For object `v12` on `v16`: x = -0.08, y = 0.08, z = 0.781, and theta = 0.0.
           *   For object `v14` on `v16`: x = 0.08, y = 0.08, z = 0.781, and theta = 0.0.
           
           This should give the planner everything it needs to generate a successful plan to solve the problem.
