User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.114, 0.205), (-0.016, 0.303)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.087, -0.33, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.976, 0.217).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.119, 0.366, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.424, 0.906).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.134, -0.376), (-0.041, -0.283)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.069, 0.317), (0.168, 0.415)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.065, 0.254, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.322, 0.947).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom stackable(v14, v10)

           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom atpose(v14, v15)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachability**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. My objective is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all onto `v16`.  Essentially, I need to manipulate their positions so that they're on the surface.  From the initial state, I see that they're all currently supported by `v11`, but located at different positions: `v8` at `v9`, `v12` at `v13`, and `v14` at `v15`.  The critical point here is that my axioms revolve around the `on` predicate, which is derived from `supported` and `atpose`.
           
           I've examined the action instances available, and that's where the problem arises.  The only action I have at my disposal is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. This tells me the robot can only move its base, effectively meaning it has no capability to pick up, manipulate, or place any of these objects. I'm dealing with a scenario where I *need* to change the `atpose` of objects, moving them to be on `v16`, but the only tool I have allows for the robot's base mobility.
           
           Considering the available actions, achieving the `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)` goals is simply impossible.  I'm limited to base movement, and the task requires object manipulation, specifically moving these objects to the desired pose.  Therefore, I'm concluding that the plan is *unreachable* with the given action set.
