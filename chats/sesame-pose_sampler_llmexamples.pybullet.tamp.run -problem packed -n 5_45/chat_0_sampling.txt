           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single square surface centered at the origin. The object is also square, with sides of approximately 0.0978. Since the surface has extents from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y, and the object has an extent of about 0.0978, there is plenty of room for stable placement. The object can be placed at various positions and orientations as long as its bounding box remains within the surface's bounding box. For a square object, rotating it by 0 or pi/2 radians does not change its effective bounding box dimensions with respect to the world axes.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I am asked to place object 5, which is a square with side length approximately 0.09387, on surface 0. Surface 0 is the same as before, from -0.135 to 0.135 in x and y. I also know that object 4 was successfully placed at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). I need to place object 5 such that it does not collide with object 4, and it is entirely on surface 0.
           
           Since object 4 is at the center (0,0) with 0 rotation, its bounding box occupies from -0.0978087291174621/2 to 0.0978087291174621/2 in x and y, which is roughly from -0.0489 to 0.0489.
           Object 5 has a side length of approximately 0.09387. Its half-side length is approximately 0.0469.
           Therefore, if I place object 5 at (0,0), it would collide with object 4. I need to find positions for object 5 that are outside the bounding box of object 4 but still within surface 0.
           
           The surface ranges from -0.135 to 0.135.
           The half-size of object 4 is roughly 0.0489.
           The half-size of object 5 is roughly 0.0469.
           
           To avoid collision, the center of object 5 must be far enough from the center of object 4. For example, if placed along the x-axis, the minimum x-coordinate for the center of object 5 to avoid collision with object 4 would be 0.0489 (half of obj 4) + 0.0469 (half of obj 5) = 0.0958.
           This is within the surface limits: 0.0958 + 0.0469 (half of obj 5) = 0.1427, which is slightly outside the surface boundary of 0.135.
           So a placement at (0.0958, 0, 0) might be too close to the edge. I need to be careful with the exact numbers.
           
           Object 4 half-extent: 0.0978087291174621 / 2 = 0.04890436455873105
           Object 5 half-extent: 0.09387364961474168 / 2 = 0.04693682480737084
           
           Maximum x for object 5: 0.135 - 0.04693682480737084 = 0.08806317519262916
           Minimum x for object 5: -0.135 + 0.04693682480737084 = -0.08806317519262916
           
           To avoid collision with object 4 at (0,0) (with extent from -0.048904 to 0.048904):
           The center of object 5 in x must be greater than 0.04890436455873105 + 0.04693682480737084 = 0.0958411893661019.
           Or less than -(0.04890436455873105 + 0.04693682480737084) = -0.0958411893661019.
           
           This means placing object 5 along the x-axis at (0.09584, 0) would result in its right edge at 0.09584 + 0.046936 = 0.142776, which is outside 0.135.
           Therefore, placing object 5 directly to the side of object 4 on the same axis is not possible without collision or going off the surface.
           This means I must place object 5 such that it is partially overlapping with the bounding box of object 4 if their centers are too close, or I must rotate it, or I must find a clever corner placement. Since both objects are squares, rotating by pi/2 radians does not change the bounding box extents.
           
           Let's re-evaluate. The condition for stability is that the object is *fully contained within the bounds of the surface*. The condition for collision is that the object *collides with any of the fixed obstacles*. Object 4 is now a fixed obstacle.
           
           The actual maximum extent for object 5 if placed at (x,y) with 0 rotation is given by `max(abs(x) + size_x/2, abs(y) + size_y/2)`. This must be less than or equal to 0.135.
           So, `abs(x) + 0.04693682480737084 <= 0.135`. This means `abs(x) <= 0.08806317519262916`.
           Similarly, `abs(y) <= 0.08806317519262916`.
           
           Object 4 has x range `(-0.04890436455873105, 0.04890436455873105)`.
           And y range `(-0.04890436455873105, 0.04890436455873105)`.
           
           To avoid collision with object 4, object 5's AABB must not overlap with object 4's AABB.
           This means:
           `(x + size_x/2 <= -0.04890436455873105)` OR `(x - size_x/2 >= 0.04890436455873105)` OR
           `(y + size_y/2 <= -0.04890436455873105)` OR `(y - size_y/2 >= 0.04890436455873105)`.
           
           Let's test an x-placement:
           `x - 0.04693682480737084 >= 0.04890436455873105`
           `x >= 0.04890436455873105 + 0.04693682480737084`
           `x >= 0.0958411893661019`
           
           But we know `abs(x) <= 0.08806317519262916` for surface containment.
           Since `0.09584 > 0.08806`, it is impossible to place object 5 directly to the side of object 4 without collision and staying within the surface.
           This implies I cannot place object 5 such that it is entirely to the right, left, top, or bottom of object 4 if both are axis-aligned.
           
           This means object 5 must be placed such that it is "touching" object 4's corners or slightly overlapping with object 4's AABB. But since I am told "collision with any of the fixed obstacles", I must assume AABB collision detection.
           
           Let's reconsider the problem statement: "The placement must be stable, meaning that the object is fully contained within the bounds of the surface." and "if a placement fails multiple times, it is likely that there is a collision that you are not aware of, and you should try a different placement."
           
           The previous request specifically gave `(ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0` as a success, meaning it did not collide with any *fixed obstacles*. Now, object 4 *is* a fixed obstacle.
           
           Given that object 4 is at (0,0), and its x-extent is roughly [-0.0489, 0.0489] and y-extent is roughly [-0.0489, 0.0489].
           Object 5 needs to be placed. Its half-extent is roughly 0.0469.
           The surface extends from -0.135 to 0.135.
           The maximum x-center for object 5 is 0.135 - 0.0469 = 0.0881.
           The minimum x-center for object 5 is -0.135 + 0.0469 = -0.0881.
           
           If object 5 is to avoid collision with object 4, its x-range must be entirely outside object 4's x-range OR its y-range must be entirely outside object 4's y-range.
           Let `[x4_min, x4_max]` be object 4's x-range, and `[x5_min, x5_max]` be object 5's x-range.
           No collision in x implies `x5_max <= x4_min` or `x5_min >= x4_max`.
           No collision in y implies `y5_max <= y4_min` or `y5_min >= y4_max`.
           
           `x4_min = -0.048904`, `x4_max = 0.048904`.
           `x5_half = 0.046936`.
           
           To avoid collision, if placed purely in X:
           `x_center_5 + x5_half <= -0.048904` => `x_center_5 <= -0.048904 - 0.046936 = -0.09584`.
           `x_center_5 - x5_half >= 0.048904` => `x_center_5 >= 0.048904 + 0.046936 = 0.09584`.
           
           However, the maximum allowed center for object 5 is `0.135 - x5_half = 0.135 - 0.046936 = 0.088064`.
           And the minimum allowed center for object 5 is `-0.135 + x5_half = -0.088064`.
           
           Since `0.09584 > 0.088064`, it is impossible to place object 5 along the x-axis or y-axis such that it does not collide with object 4 and is fully contained within the surface.
           This is a critical point.
           
           This suggests that the "fixed obstacles" feedback is about AABB-AABB collision for now.
           Perhaps the instruction "you must avoid collision between objects i and j" does not imply *AABB* collision, but actual collision of the object geometry? If so, for two squares, if one is rotated by 45 degrees, their AABBs will overlap more than their actual geometries. However, the object geometry is *described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)*. This implies that the object *is* its AABB.
           
           If I cannot place the object without AABB collision, then there might be a misunderstanding on my part or the problem setup.
           "The placement must be stable, meaning that the object is fully contained within the bounds of the surface."
           "avoid collision between objects i and j."
           
           What if I place object 5 "on a corner" of object 4?
           Let's try a placement for object 5 at (0.05, 0.05).
           Object 4's x-range is `[-0.0489, 0.0489]`. y-range `[-0.0489, 0.0489]`.
           Object 5 at (0.05, 0.05) has x-range `[0.05 - 0.0469, 0.05 + 0.0469]` = `[0.0031, 0.0969]`.
           And y-range `[0.0031, 0.0969]`.
           The x-ranges `[-0.0489, 0.0489]` and `[0.0031, 0.0969]` overlap.
           The y-ranges `[-0.0489, 0.0489]` and `[0.0031, 0.0969]` overlap.
           So, this placement would collide.
           
           This implies that there's no way to place object 5 without collision with object 4, while keeping both objects axis-aligned. This is a very strange scenario.
           
           However, the problem statement: "The geometry of the object will be described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)." This is crucial. This implies that for collision detection, the AABB is what matters, even if the actual object might be a square that's rotated, leading to a smaller bounding box for the object itself. But if I'm only given AABB dimensions, it means I should use those for collision.
           
           What if the surfaces define where the *center* of the object can be? "object is fully contained within the bounds of the surface". Usually this means the object's entire geometry, not just its center.
           
           If it's truly impossible to place it without collision based on AABBs:
           Maybe the problem implies that I *must* avoid collision, and the collision detection is based on the actual rotated geometry, not its axis-aligned bounding box if rotated. However, the problem states "geometry of the object will be described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)". This is contradictory if rotation changes the AABB that is used for collision.
           
           Let's assume that the collision is based on the *current* AABB of the object given its rotation.
           If I rotate a square by 45 degrees (pi/4), its new AABB will be larger than the original `(size_x, size_y)` if it's axis-aligned.
           The diagonal of object 5 is `sqrt(0.09387^2 + 0.09387^2) = 0.09387 * sqrt(2) = 0.13276`.
           If object 5 is rotated by pi/4, its new AABB side length would be 0.13276.
           Its half-extent would be `0.13276 / 2 = 0.06638`.
           
           Let's try placing it at (0,0) with pi/4 rotation.
           Object 4's half-extent: 0.0489.
           Object 5's half-extent when rotated by pi/4: 0.06638.
           Collision if at (0,0) (overlap in AABB).
           This also results in a larger object, making it harder to fit on the surface.
           Max center x for surface `0.135 - 0.06638 = 0.06862`.
           To avoid object 4 when rotated:
           `x_center_5 - 0.06638 >= 0.048904` => `x_center_5 >= 0.048904 + 0.06638 = 0.115284`.
           This is greater than 0.06862, so it's even more impossible.
           
           This means that collision detection for object 5 must use its original AABB dimensions `0.09387`, regardless of rotation angle for simplicity or for the definition of 'object geometry'. This is often done when the object geometry is simplified to a 'fat' AABB that encloses all rotations.
           
           "geometry of the object will be described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)." This phrasing is strange if rotation is intended to change the effective AABB for collision. If `size_x` and `size_y` *always* refer to the AABB dimensions of the *unrotated* object, then collision detection should use these dimensions for the rotated object. This means the bounding box for collision for a rotated square is still `size_x` by `size_y` as if it were unrotated, which is an unusual interpretation. But it's the only way to make sense of the problem if the previous AABB analysis is correct.
           
           If `size_x` and `size_y` are the dimensions of the *unrotated* object's AABB, and the collision detection considers the smallest AABB enclosing the *rotated* object, then my calculation for the rotated AABB is correct. However, if `size_x` and `size_y` *always* refer to the effective AABB regardless of rotation, then it's effectively a square. But then rotation has no effect on its AABB. This would make the `theta` parameter less useful.
           
           Let's assume the more common interpretation: `size_x` and `size_y` are dimensions when `theta=0`. When `theta != 0`, the effective AABB expands. My calculations for the rotated object's AABB for a square are correct.
           And my conclusion that no placement for object 5 is possible if it must not collide with object 4, and be fully contained within the surface, stands.
           
           This leads me to believe that there's a specific instruction I'm misinterpreting or an assumption I'm making that is incorrect.
           "If you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene." - This is about non-fixed obstacles. Object 4 is now a *fixed obstacle*. So my collision detection with object 4 should be valid.
           
           Let's check the numbers again extremely carefully.
           Surface 0: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`
           Object 4: `(0.0978087291174621, 0.09780872911746208)` at `(0.0, 0.0)` with `theta=0.0`.
             Half-extents of Obj 4: `hx4 = 0.0978087291174621 / 2 = 0.04890436455873105`
             Obj 4 AABB: `[-0.04890436455873105, 0.04890436455873105]` in both X and Y.
           
           Object 5: `(0.09387364961474168, 0.09387364961474165)` at `(x5, y5)` with `theta5`.
             Half-extents of Obj 5 (unrotated): `hx5 = 0.09387364961474168 / 2 = 0.04693682480737084`
           
           Condition for placement on surface 0:
           `abs(x5) + hx5 <= 0.135` => `abs(x5) <= 0.135 - 0.04693682480737084 = 0.08806317519262916`
           `abs(y5) + hx5 <= 0.135` => `abs(y5) <= 0.135 - 0.04693682480737084 = 0.08806317519262916`
           
           Condition for no AABB collision with Obj 4:
           `x5 - hx5 >= 0.04890436455873105` OR
           `x5 + hx5 <= -0.04890436455873105` OR
           `y5 - hx5 >= 0.04890436455873105` OR
           `y5 + hx5 <= -0.04890436455873105`
           
           Let's test the first condition:
           `x5 >= 0.04890436455873105 + hx5`
           `x5 >= 0.04890436455873105 + 0.04693682480737084`
           `x5 >= 0.0958411893661019`
           
           But from surface containment, `x5` must be `<= 0.08806317519262916`.
           `0.0958411893661019 > 0.08806317519262916`. This means there is no `x5` that satisfies both the no-collision and surface-containment conditions along the positive x-axis.
           The same applies for negative x, positive y, and negative y.
           
           So, if both objects are axis-aligned, there is no valid placement.
           This can only mean two things:
           1. My interpretation of AABB collision for rotated objects is wrong, and `size_x` and `size_y` *always* define the AABB of the object regardless of `theta`. In this case, `theta` has no effect on AABB collision, and the conclusion is still no valid placement.
           2. The problem implies collision detection is based on the actual geometry (not the AABB of the object with `size_x`, `size_y` being its original dimensions). If the object is a square, a rotated square can fit in places where its AABB cannot. But this would contradict "geometry of the object will be described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)".
           
           Given the strong constraints and the instruction to "never give up", I must try to find *some* placement. The only way such a placement would exist is if the collision detection is not strictly AABB-AABB, or if my numbers have a small rounding error that makes it seem impossible.
           
           Let's consider a placement where the corners almost touch.
           E.g., object 5 at `x = 0.04890436455873105 + epsilon` and `y = 0.04890436455873105 + epsilon`.
           This would be `x = 0.048904 + 0.046936 = 0.09584`.
           This still makes `x_center = 0.09584` which is too large.
           
           Is it possible that "avoid collision between objects i and j" does *not* mean *AABB* collision, but rather the actual geometric collision of the objects which are squares? For squares, if one is rotated by 45 degrees, its actual footprint is smaller than its AABB. But then the problem description is misleading by giving AABB as geometry.
           
           Let's try to place it at a location that *would* collide based on my AABB analysis, but is as far as possible without leaving the surface.
           For example, placing `x5` at `0.08806317519262916` (max for surface containment).
           Its x-range would be `[0.088063 - 0.046936, 0.088063 + 0.046936]` = `[0.041127, 0.135]`.
           This clearly overlaps with object 4's x-range `[-0.0489, 0.0489]`.
           So, if `y5` is `0`, then there will be an x-collision.
           
           The only way to avoid this is if `y5` makes `y5 - hx5 >= 0.048904` or `y5 + hx5 <= -0.048904`.
           So, `y5 >= 0.09584` or `y5 <= -0.09584`.
           But `y5` must be `<= 0.088063`.
           This is a contradiction.
           
           This is highly problematic. Is it possible that the previous placement for ID 4 was not exactly (0,0,0,0)? The success message just says `0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0`. I assume this is `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`.
           
           What if the initial placement for object 4 failed? "The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles." This means object 4's placement at (0,0,0,0) was successful against the *fixed* obstacles at that time. Now object 4 itself is a fixed obstacle.
           
           I must provide 50 placements. I will generate some placements that are within the surface bounds, but based on my analysis, these would collide with object 4. If they fail, I have learned more about the environment. If they somehow succeed, then my collision understanding is wrong. Since I *must* avoid collision, and the previous analysis showed that it's impossible with axis-aligned AABBs, I will try to use a very small epsilon distance to avoid object 4, even if it goes slightly out of bounds based on my calculation, or is "just touching". This would imply a tolerance in the system, or that the AABB collision is not as strict as a simple overlap check.
           
           Let's assume there is a very small tolerance or the coordinates are rounded.
           Max position for Obj 5: `0.08806317519262916`.
           Min position to clear Obj 4: `0.0958411893661019`.
           
           If I put `x5` at `0.088` and `y5` at `0.088`, it is within surface.
           Its X extent: `[0.088 - 0.0469, 0.088 + 0.0469]` = `[0.0411, 0.1349]`.
           Its Y extent: `[0.0411, 0.1349]`.
           Object 4's X extent: `[-0.0489, 0.0489]`.
           Object 4's Y extent: `[-0.0489, 0.0489]`.
           These X-extents `[0.0411, 0.1349]` and `[-0.0489, 0.0489]` clearly overlap (at least at `x=0.0411` up to `x=0.0489`).
           The Y-extents also overlap. So this still collides.
           
           This is a scenario where the object is too large to fit in the remaining space around the existing object.
           If the objects were circles, they could be placed in corners. But they are squares.
           
           Unless the description of object `ID: 4` in the success output means its geometry itself, rather than its *AABB* when it was placed. But "object extents (size_x, size_y)" refers to its AABB.
           
           I will proceed by making placements that maximize distance from (0,0) without exceeding surface bounds, in the hope that there's a slight difference in how collision is handled or my precision. Since I *must* provide 50 placements, I will generate a diverse set, starting with placements near the corners of the surface, as far from (0,0) as possible.
           
           Let `max_center = 0.08806317519262916`.
           And `min_center = -0.08806317519262916`.
           
           Placements:
           (0, 0.0, 0.088, 0.0)
           (0, 0.0, -0.088, 0.0)

           (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.088)
           (0, 0.0, 0.088, 0.088)
           (0, 0.0, 0.088, -0.088)
           (0, 0.0, -0.088, 0.088)

           (0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.0)
           (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.08)
           (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.08)
           (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.08)
           (0, 0.0, 0.08, -0.08)
           (0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.08)
           (0, 0.0, -0.08, -0.08)
           
           Now with 45 degree rotation.
           New half extent: `0.09387364961474168 * sqrt(2) / 2 = 0.06637999818835824`.
           Max center: `0.135 - 0.06637999818835824 = 0.06862000181164176`.
           
           (0, 0.7853981633974483, 0.068, 0.0)
           (0, 0.7853981633974483, -0.068, 0.0)
           (0, 0.7853981633974483, 0.0, 0.068)
           (0, 0.7853981633974483, 0.0, -0.068)
           (0, 0.7853981633974483, 0.068, 0.068)
           (0, 0.7853981633974483, 0.068, -0.068)
           (0, 0.7853981633974483, -0.068, 0.068)
           (0, 0.7853981633974483, -0.068, -0.068)
           
           Since all these placements would collide if object 4 is a fixed AABB at (0,0) and object 5 is treated as an AABB for collision, there is no geometrically stable placement as per my understanding.
           However, I will provide the placements as requested. It's possible that the "collision with fixed obstacles" implies a less stringent or slightly different check than I'm performing, or that there's a small numerical error making it seem impossible when it's just barely possible. Or, it's possible that the definition of collision (AABB vs actual geometry) is different than what I am assuming given the "AABB as geometry" phrasing. I am going with the interpretation that I must provide placements that are valid under a strict AABB interpretation, and if that leads to failure, I learn.
           
           If the problem assumes AABB collision, and the values are exact, then it is impossible to place object 5 without collision. Given "never give up", I'll list positions that are as far from the center as possible, pushing the boundaries. Perhaps a tiny gap allows it, or the fixed obstacles are treated differently.
           
           I will fill the rest of the 50 slots by slightly varying the x, y coordinates within the allowable range, and using different angles. If the problem implies that I should find *any* placement, even if it's "obviously" colliding based on my internal model, I will do so.
           
           Let's try a small offset from the center, such that it's *within* the "collision zone" but perhaps on the edge of the actual object if the geometry is not purely AABB. This contradicts "avoid collision between objects i and j", but I need to fulfill the request. If the *true* collision system is not AABB, there might be room.
           
           If I consider the corners of the surface, they are `(0.135, 0.135)`, etc.
           The object's AABB half-extent is `0.046936`.
           So, the maximum center coordinate is `0.135 - 0.046936 = 0.088064`.
           Placing at `(0.088064, 0.088064)` should be the "outermost" corner.
           This would make object 5's x-range `[0.088064 - 0.046936, 0.088064 + 0.046936]` = `[0.041128, 0.135]`.
           Its y-range is also `[0.041128, 0.135]`.
           Object 4's x-range: `[-0.048904, 0.048904]`.
           There is an overlap in x: `[0.041128, 0.048904]` and an overlap in y: `[0.041128, 0.048904]`.
           This is a definite AABB collision.
           
           I will just generate diverse placements within the surface. If these are considered "stable" by the system, it indicates my collision model is wrong.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     Okay, this is interesting. The placement `(ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.088, 0.0` was successful. This contradicts my previous AABB collision analysis. Let me re-evaluate based on this new information.
           
           The fixed obstacles are now:
           Object 4 (ID: 4): at `(0.0, 0.0)` with `theta=0.0`. Its half-extents: `hx4 = 0.0978087291174621 / 2 = 0.04890436455873105`.
           Object 5 (ID: 5): at `(0.088, 0.0)` with `theta=0.0`. Its half-extents: `hx5 = 0.09387364961474168 / 2 = 0.04693682480737084`.
           
           My previous AABB collision check for Object 5 at `(0.088, 0.0)`:
           Object 5's x-range: `[0.088 - 0.0469368, 0.088 + 0.0469368]` = `[0.0410632, 0.1349368]`.
           Object 4's x-range: `[-0.0489043, 0.0489043]`.
           These two ranges `[0.0410632, 0.1349368]` and `[-0.0489043, 0.0489043]` overlap. Specifically, `[0.0410632, 0.0489043]` is common to both.
           Since the y-coordinates are the same and both are axis-aligned, their y-ranges also overlap (or are the same if centered at y=0).
           This means that an AABB collision *did occur* according to my strict AABB definition.
           
           The fact that `(ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.088, 0.0` was a success implies one of the following:
           1. There's a slight tolerance in the collision detection, meaning a very small overlap is acceptable.
           2. The collision detection for objects with `theta=0` uses a different, perhaps tighter, bounding box than the `size_x, size_y` if they are considered "actual geometry".
           3. The objects are allowed to slightly overlap without being considered a "collision".
           4. The `x` and `y` coordinates are actually the center of the bounding box after rotation, and the `size_x, size_y` are the dimensions of the original object, and the true collision is with the geometry not its axis-aligned bounding box.
           
           Let's assume there is a small tolerance.
           The x-overlap I calculated was `0.0489043 - 0.0410632 = 0.0078411`. This is not a "very small" tolerance for these object sizes. This suggests it's more likely that the problem has a different definition of collision.
           
           "The geometry of the object will be described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)." This is still the core definition. If an object *is* its AABB, then the overlap should be a collision.
           
           However, the feedback is clear: these are successful placements. I must use this to learn.
           The implication is that a placement for object 5 centered at (0.088, 0.0) with half-width 0.046936 is *not* colliding with object 4 centered at (0.0, 0.0) with half-width 0.048904.
           The right edge of Obj 4 is at `0.048904`.
           The left edge of Obj 5 is at `0.088 - 0.046936 = 0.041064`.
           Since `0.041064 < 0.048904`, the left edge of Obj 5 is to the left of the right edge of Obj 4.
           This is an AABB overlap.
           This means for these problems, AABB overlap is *not* what defines a collision.
           It means collision is defined by the actual geometry of the square, or some other rule.
           
           If a placement like `(0, 0.0, 0.088, 0.0)` for object 5 is stable, it implies that the distance between the centers `0.088` is considered sufficient to avoid collision.
           The sum of half-extents is `0.048904 + 0.046936 = 0.09584`.
           The distance between centers (along x) is `0.088`.
           Since `0.088 < 0.09584`, they are *not* separated based on AABB.
           
           This implies that the object is *not* its AABB for collision purposes. It must be something more specific. The most common interpretation for square objects given an `(x, y, theta)` placement is that `x, y` is the center and `theta` is the rotation of the actual square geometry. The `size_x, size_y` would then be the dimensions of that square.
           
           If this is the case, then for squares, actual collision between two axis-aligned squares occurs if their axis-aligned bounding boxes (which are their actual geometry) overlap. This brings me back to the same problem.
           
           Let me consider the total space taken by object 4 and object 5 along the x-axis.
           Obj 4: `[-0.048904, 0.048904]`
           Obj 5: `[0.041064, 0.134936]`
           The combined space occupied is `[-0.048904, 0.134936]`. The total width is `0.134936 - (-0.048904) = 0.18384`.
           The total surface width is `0.135 - (-0.135) = 0.270`.
           Both objects are fully contained in the surface:
           Max X for Obj 4 is `0.048904 < 0.135`. Min X for Obj 4 is `-0.048904 > -0.135`.
           Max X for Obj 5 is `0.134936 < 0.135`. Min X for Obj 5 is `0.041064 > -0.135`.
           
           The critical piece of information is that the collision *did not occur*. This means that the system's collision check is not based on simple AABB overlap as I had assumed.
           If the objects are squares, maybe the system looks at the distance between actual object boundaries, and only considers collision if the *interiors* overlap, allowing touching boundaries.
           The left edge of object 5 is at 0.041064. The right edge of object 4 is at 0.048904.
           If they are distinct, then `0.041064 > 0.048904` or `0.041064 == 0.048904` or if there's an epsilon.
           The distance between the objects at their closest point is `0.048904 - 0.041064 = 0.00784`.
           This non-zero distance means they are separated.
           
           This means my calculation for the placement of Object 5 at `(0.088, 0.0)` must have been flawed in the previous round, or I was calculating its extent incorrectly.
           Let's recalculate the placement `(ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.088, 0.0`.
           Object 5 `(size_x=0.09387364961474168, size_y=0.09387364961474165)`.
           Half-extent `hx5 = 0.04693682480737084`.
           Position `x5 = 0.088`.
           Left edge of Object 5: `x5 - hx5 = 0.088 - 0.04693682480737084 = 0.04106317519262916`.
           Right edge of Object 5: `x5 + hx5 = 0.088 + 0.04693682480737084 = 0.13493682480737084`.
           
           Object 4 `(size_x=0.0978087291174621, size_y=0.09780872911746208)`.
           Half-extent `hx4 = 0.04890436455873105`.
           Position `x4 = 0.0`.
           Left edge of Object 4: `x4 - hx4 = -0.04890436455873105`.
           Right edge of Object 4: `x4 + hx4 = 0.04890436455873105`.
           
           Compare `Left edge of Obj 5` with `Right edge of Obj 4`:
           `0.04106317519262916` vs `0.04890436455873105`.
           My statement `0.041064 < 0.048904` from before still stands.
           This means the left edge of object 5 *is inside* the x-range of object 4.
           This is a direct overlap.
           
           There must be a different kind of collision check, or the provided (x,y) coordinates are not truly the center of the geometry for collision.
           Given `(ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.088, 0.0` was successful, I need to understand why.
           It suggests that *either* the extents are slightly different from the stated sizes, *or* the definition of collision itself is different.
           Perhaps the fixed obstacles are treated as points (their center), or their 'active' collision area is smaller than their bounding box? No, that would be very strange.
           
           Let me consider the problem as a geometry puzzle. What configuration allows (0,0,0,0) and (0,0,0.088,0.0) for objects of these sizes to not collide?
           If they are squares, the only way is if the origin for Object 4 is *not* 0,0, or if its half-width is smaller. Or if Object 5 is not centered at 0.088, or its half-width is smaller.
           Since the data is given, I assume these values are exact.
           
           This is a key learning point: The collision detection *does not* use the full AABB overlap for the objects given their `size_x` and `size_y` as if they were axis-aligned. It must be something more permissive.
           
           For Object 7 (ID: 7): `(size_x=0.08644905404092112, size_y=0.08644905404092107)`.
           Half-extent `hx7 = 0.08644905404092112 / 2 = 0.04322452702046056`.
           
           Surface 0 bounds: `[-0.135, 0.135]`.
           Max center for Obj 7: `0.135 - hx7 = 0.135 - 0.04322452702046056 = 0.09177547297953944`.
           Min center for Obj 7: `-0.09177547297953944`.
           
           I now have two fixed obstacles:
           Obj 4: center `(0.0, 0.0)`, `hx4 = 0.04890436455873105`.
           Obj 5: center `(0.088, 0.0)`, `hx5 = 0.04693682480737084`.
           
           If I follow the pattern of the successful placement for Object 5, I should try to place Object 7 to the right of Object 5.
           Center of Obj 5: `0.088`. Right edge of Obj 5: `0.088 + 0.04693682480737084 = 0.13493682480737084`.
           Left edge of Obj 7: `x7 - hx7`.
           To clear Obj 5, I need `x7 - hx7` to be `> 0.13493682480737084`.
           So, `x7 > 0.13493682480737084 + hx7 = 0.13493682480737084 + 0.04322452702046056 = 0.1781613518278314`.
           This is far too large for the surface (max center `0.091775`).
           
           This means placing Object 7 directly to the right of Object 5 is not possible, even with this "relaxed" collision model which allowed Obj 5 and 4 to seemingly overlap.
           
           What if the collision check is *only* on the center coordinate? No, that would be too simple and not physical.
           What if it's object *bounds* collision, but `size_x` and `size_y` represent the actual object's visual extent, and the collision hull is slightly smaller? No, problem says AABB.
           
           The only remaining interpretation is that the previous collision analysis was correct for AABB collision, and the successes mean that:
           - The effective collision size of object 4 when placed at (0,0) might be smaller than its `size_x`.
           - OR, the effective collision size of object 5 when placed at (0.088,0) might be smaller.
           - OR, `theta` has a significant and non-obvious effect on collision area.
           
           Let's assume the collision is based on a strict non-overlap of geometry. The fact that the previous one passed means that my calculation of `0.04106317519262916` vs `0.04890436455873105` must be wrong, or my interpretation of a collision.
           If `0.04106317519262916` is the left edge of Obj 5 and `0.04890436455873105` is the right edge of Obj 4, then for no collision, the left edge of Obj 5 must be `>=' right edge of Obj 4`. This is not true.
           
           The simplest explanation for the successful placement of ID 5 is that the true effective half-width of the objects is *smaller* than `size_x/2`. Or that there is some form of implicit padding or margin.
           However, I'm given the "extents" as AABB sizes.
           
           I will try to place object 7 in the corner of the surface as far away from both object 4 and object 5 as possible.
           Surface bounds `[-0.135, 0.135]`.
           Max center for Obj 7 is `0.09177547`.
           Let's try `(0.091775, 0.091775)` for object 7.
           This is within the surface.
           X-range of Obj 7: `[0.091775 - 0.043224, 0.091775 + 0.043224]` = `[0.048551, 0.134999]`.
           Y-range of Obj 7: `[0.048551, 0.134999]`.
           
           Check collision with Obj 4 `(0,0)`:
           Obj 4 x-range: `[-0.048904, 0.048904]`.
           Obj 7 x-range: `[0.048551, 0.134999]`.
           These overlap slightly: `[0.048551, 0.048904]`.
           Y-ranges also overlap.
           
           This again suggests an AABB collision. Yet, based on previous feedback, AABB overlaps *can* be successful.
           So, I will generate placements that are within surface bounds and try to keep them "far" from the centers of existing objects, but acknowledge that strict AABB non-overlap might not be the criteria.
           I must assume that the system's collision detection is more tolerant than a simple AABB check, or works with effective 'inner' geometry.
           
           Given the success of ID 5: `(0, 0.0, 0.088, 0.0)`. This placement has its left edge at `0.041063`. The right edge of ID 4 is at `0.048904`. They are still overlapping. This must mean that object "collision" means something different than what I am used to.
           Could it be that the collision is only checked for the 'actual' square geometry, and that the `(size_x, size_y)` for an object is its bounding box *at `theta=0`* but not necessarily its collision-box *at `theta=0`*? This is confusing.
           
           I will use the coordinates for placements that are maximally far from the origin, similar to what I tried with object 5, assuming that similar overlap levels might be tolerated.
           Obj 7 hx = `0.0432245`.
           Max center `x = 0.135 - 0.0432245 = 0.0917755`.
           I'll try to put object 7 at `(-0.088, 0.0)`. This should be clear of object 5.
           Obj 7 x-range: `[-0.088 - 0.0432245, -0.088 + 0.0432245]` = `[-0.1312245, -0.0447755]`.
           Obj 4 x-range: `[-0.0489043, 0.0489043]`.
           These also overlap: `[-0.0489043, -0.0447755]`.
           This would be another "colliding" placement by AABB standards. But it might succeed, like the previous one.
           
           I will prioritize placing object 7 at positions that are symmetrically opposite to object 5, or in the remaining 'quadrants' that are further from both object 4 and 5, always respecting surface boundaries.
           
           Object 4 center (0,0), radius approx 0.0489.
           Object 5 center (0.088,0), radius approx 0.0469.
           The rightmost point of obj 4 is 0.0489. The leftmost point of obj 5 is 0.041. So these "overlap" by about 0.0078.
           The rightmost point of obj 5 is 0.1349.
           The leftmost point of obj 4 is -0.0489.
           
           For object 7 (radius 0.0432):
           To avoid object 4 effectively (similar to object 5's clearance):
           Its x-coordinate must be `> 0.048904` or `< -0.048904`.
           If `x7 > 0.048904`. Its leftmost edge `x7 - 0.043224`.
           If this left edge `x7 - 0.043224` is also `> 0.048904`, then `x7 > 0.048904 + 0.043224 = 0.092128`.
           This value `0.092128` is slightly larger than the maximum allowed center for Obj 7, which is `0.091775`.
           So, object 7 *cannot* be placed strictly to the right of object 4 without AABB overlap and being within surface.
           
           This implies that the "allowed overlap" has to be similar.
           The `0.088` center for object 5 resulted in its left edge being `0.04106`.
           The right edge of object 4 is `0.04890`.
           The difference is `0.04890 - 0.04106 = 0.00784`. This is the overlap.
           
           If I apply the same "overlap" tolerance, I can find placements.
           Try placing object 7 at `x = 0.088` for symmetry, but this will collide with Obj 5.
           So, I need to place it such that its AABB *is* overlapping but considered not a collision.
           
           Let's place object 7 at `(-0.088, 0.0)`.
           Its right edge: `-0.088 + 0.0432245 = -0.0447755`.
           Obj 4's left edge: `-0.0489043`.
           The right edge of Obj 7 is `>-0.0489043`. They overlap by `0.0489043 - 0.0447755 = 0.0041288`. This is less than the previous `0.00784`. Perhaps this will pass.
           
           I will also place it in the corners (e.g. `0.091775, 0.091775`), as these were attempted before.
           
           Placements:
           (0, 0.0, -0.088, 0.0)
           (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.088) # This will collide with both if obj 4 is (0,0) and obj 5 is (0.088,0)
           (0, 0.0, 0.0917, 0.0917)
           (0, 0.0, 0.0917, -0.0917)

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I've received further successful placements, which continue to refine my understanding of the collision rules.
           
           Successful placements so far:
           - Object 4 (ID: 4): `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)` (half-extent `hx4 = 0.04890436455873105`)
           - Object 5 (ID: 5): `(0, 0.0, 0.088, 0.0)` (half-extent `hx5 = 0.04693682480737084`)
           - Object 7 (ID: 7): `(0, 0.0, -0.088, 0.0)` (half-extent `hx7 = 0.04322452702046056`)
           
           Let's re-examine the collision between Object 4 and Object 5, and Object 4 and Object 7, based on these successes.
           **Object 4 vs Object 5:**
           Object 4 X-range: `[-0.048904, 0.048904]`
           Object 5 X-range (centered at 0.088): `[0.088 - 0.046936, 0.088 + 0.046936]` = `[0.041064, 0.134936]`
           These ranges overlap: `[0.041064, 0.048904]`. The overlap length is `0.048904 - 0.041064 = 0.00784`.
           
           **Object 4 vs Object 7:**
           Object 4 X-range: `[-0.048904, 0.048904]`
           Object 7 X-range (centered at -0.088): `[-0.088 - 0.043224, -0.088 + 0.043224]` = `[-0.131224, -0.044776]`
           These ranges overlap: `[-0.048904, -0.044776]`. The overlap length is `0.048904 - 0.044776 = 0.004128`.
           
           The key insight is that despite these AABB overlaps, the placements were successful. This confirms that a simple AABB overlap does not constitute a "collision" in this system. This is a critical learning for finding new stable placements.
           It appears there's a certain tolerance for overlap, or the "geometry" of the object as described by `size_x` and `size_y` is actually an "outer" bound, and the true collision geometry is slightly smaller. Or, it could be that the collision check itself allows for a certain depth of intersection before flagging a collision.
           
           Given this, I should aim for placements that are within the surface bounds and avoid significant overlaps with existing objects. The existing objects are all centered at `y=0.0`. So, the y-axis is still relatively free.
           
           The new object is Object 8 (ID: 8): `(size_x=0.09290470010083329, size_y=0.09290470010083329)`.
           Its half-extent: `hx8 = 0.09290470010083329 / 2 = 0.046452350050416645`.
           
           Surface 0 bounds: `[-0.135, 0.135]`.
           Max center for Obj 8: `0.135 - hx8 = 0.135 - 0.046452350050416645 = 0.08854764994958335`.
           Min center for Obj 8: `-0.08854764994958335`.
           
           Current fixed obstacles (all at `y=0.0`, `theta=0.0`):
           - Obj 7: center `(-0.088, 0.0)`, x-range `[-0.131224, -0.044776]`
           - Obj 4: center `(0.0, 0.0)`, x-range `[-0.048904, 0.048904]`
           - Obj 5: center `(0.088, 0.0)`, x-range `[0.041064, 0.134936]`
           
           These three objects are arranged roughly along the x-axis, covering the range from `[-0.131224, 0.134936]`.
           This means placing Object 8 at `y=0.0` would cause significant AABB overlap with at least two of the existing objects, possibly all three if placed at x=0.
           Object 8's half-extent `hx8` is `0.04645`.
           If placed at `x=0.0`, its x-range is `[-0.04645, 0.04645]`. This would overlap with Obj 4 (overlap `[-0.04645, 0.04645]`), Obj 7 (overlap `[-0.04645, -0.044776]`), and Obj 5 (overlap `[0.041064, 0.04645]`). The overlaps with Obj 7 and Obj 5 are smaller than the successful Obj 4-Obj 5 overlap. So, `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)` for Obj 8 might actually be a valid placement based on the relaxed collision criteria.
           
           However, a safer strategy would be to place Object 8 along the y-axis, away from the existing cluster.
           The `y=0.0` strip is heavily occupied.
           Let's try placing Object 8 at `(0.0, 0.088)` for example.
           Max y-center for Obj 8 is `0.088547`.
           So, `(0.0, 0.088)` is a valid center.
           Object 8 y-range: `[0.088 - 0.04645, 0.088 + 0.04645]` = `[0.04155, 0.13445]`.
           This is entirely contained within the surface `[-0.135, 0.135]`.
           Since all existing objects are centered at `y=0.0`, and their y-ranges are all `[-0.048904, 0.048904]` (for Obj 4) or smaller (for Obj 5, 7 which have smaller hx).
           The y-range of Obj 8 `[0.04155, 0.13445]` does not overlap with any of the existing objects' y-ranges.
           Specifically, its bottom edge `0.04155` is greater than `0.048904`? No.
           The top edge of Obj 4 is `0.048904`.
           The bottom edge of Obj 8 is `0.04155`.
           This means Obj 8's bottom edge is *below* Obj 4's top edge. This *still* indicates an AABB overlap in Y for an object at `(0.0, 0.088)`. Overlap is `[0.04155, 0.048904]`.
           This overlap `0.007354` is similar to the successful `0.00784` x-overlap between Obj 4 and Obj 5.
           
           Therefore, placing object 8 at `(0.0, 0.088)` or `(0.0, -0.088)` should be valid according to the learned collision rules.
           
           I will prioritize these 'y-shifted' placements.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     Okay, another successful placement has been provided:
           - Object 8 (ID: 8): `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.088)` (half-extent `hx8 = 0.046452350050416645`)
           
           This further solidifies my understanding of the "non-collision" behavior.
           Let's analyze Object 4 vs Object 8 (both centered at x=0):
           Object 4 Y-range: `[-0.048904, 0.048904]`
           Object 8 Y-range (centered at 0.088): `[0.088 - 0.046452, 0.088 + 0.046452]` = `[0.041548, 0.134452]`
           These ranges overlap: `[0.041548, 0.048904]`. The overlap length is `0.048904 - 0.041548 = 0.007356`.
           
           This overlap (`0.007356`) is very close to the `0.00784` overlap between Obj 4 and Obj 5 that was deemed non-colliding. This provides a consistent model of how "collision" is interpreted: a small degree of AABB overlap is tolerated.
           
           Current fixed obstacles (all at `theta=0.0`):
           - Obj 4: center `(0.0, 0.0)`, `hx4 = 0.048904`
           - Obj 5: center `(0.088, 0.0)`, `hx5 = 0.046937`
           - Obj 7: center `(-0.088, 0.0)`, `hx7 = 0.043225`
           - Obj 8: center `(0.0, 0.088)`, `hx8 = 0.046452`
           
           The new object is Object 6 (ID: 6): `(size_x=0.09745107389384683, size_y=0.09745107389384677)`.
           Its half-extent: `hx6 = 0.09745107389384683 / 2 = 0.048725536946923415`.
           
           Surface 0 bounds: `[-0.135, 0.135]`.
           Max center for Obj 6: `0.135 - hx6 = 0.135 - 0.048725536946923415 = 0.08627446305307658`.
           Min center for Obj 6: `-0.08627446305307658`.
           
           The current configuration of fixed objects forms a cross-like pattern around the origin, all with `theta=0`.
           - Obj 7: `[-0.1312, -0.0447]` in X, `[-0.0432, 0.0432]` in Y.
           - Obj 4: `[-0.0489, 0.0489]` in X, `[-0.0489, 0.0489]` in Y.
           - Obj 5: `[0.0410, 0.1349]` in X, `[-0.0469, 0.0469]` in Y.
           - Obj 8: `[-0.0464, 0.0464]` in X, `[0.0415, 0.1344]` in Y.
           
           This means placing Object 6 at `(0,0)` would overlap with all four objects. The overlap with Obj 4 would be `min(hx6, hx4) = 0.0487` vs `0.0489`, which is a large overlap. It might be too large.
           
           A better strategy is to place Object 6 in the remaining 'quadrant' or 'corner' area that is less occupied.
           For example, `(0.0, -0.088)` would be a good candidate, as it is symmetrically opposite to Obj 8 and has a similar overlap with Obj 4.
           Let's check `(0.0, -0.088)` for Obj 6.
           Y-range of Obj 6: `[-0.088 - 0.048725, -0.088 + 0.048725]` = `[-0.136725, -0.039275]`.
           This is slightly out of bounds on the negative y-side (`-0.136725 < -0.135`).
           So, `(0.0, -0.088)` is not valid because of surface containment.
           
           I need to make sure `abs(y6) + hx6 <= 0.135`.
           So `abs(y6) <= 0.135 - hx6 = 0.135 - 0.048725536946923415 = 0.08627446305307658`.
           Let's try placing it at `(0.0, -0.086)`.
           Y-range of Obj 6: `[-0.086 - 0.048725, -0.086 + 0.048725]` = `[-0.134725, -0.037275]`.
           This is within surface bounds.
           Collision check with Obj 4 `(0,0)`:
           Obj 4 Y-range: `[-0.048904, 0.048904]`.
           Obj 6 Y-range: `[-0.134725, -0.037275]`.
           These overlap: `[-0.048904, -0.037275]`. The overlap length is `0.048904 - 0.037275 = 0.011629`.
           This overlap `0.011629` is larger than the previous `0.00784` and `0.007356`. This might fail.
           
           Let's try to place it in one of the quadrants. E.g., `(x, y)` where `x>0` and `y<0`.
           Try `(0.086, -0.086)`. (Using `0.086` as the max allowed center coordinate).
           Obj 6 X-range: `[0.086 - 0.048725, 0.086 + 0.048725]` = `[0.037275, 0.134725]`.
           Obj 6 Y-range: `[-0.086 - 0.048725, -0.086 + 0.048725]` = `[-0.134725, -0.037275]`.
           Both ranges are within surface bounds.
           
           Collision check for `(0.086, -0.086)`:
           1. With Obj 4 `(0,0)`:
              X-overlap: `[0.037275, 0.048904]`. Overlap length `0.011629`.
              Y-overlap: `[-0.048904, -0.037275]`. Overlap length `0.011629`.
              This overlap is significant, same as calculated before.
           
           2. With Obj 5 `(0.088, 0.0)`:
              Obj 5 X-range: `[0.041064, 0.134936]`
              Obj 6 X-range: `[0.037275, 0.134725]`
              X-overlap: `[0.041064, 0.134725]`. This is a large overlap of `0.093661`. This is very likely a collision.
           
           This means placing object 6 must be very carefully done to minimize overlap.
           The only way to avoid the largest overlaps (like the one with Obj 5) is to place Object 6 further away.
           However, there isn't much space left.
           
           What if Object 6 is placed slightly further away in a corner?
           E.g., try `(0.08, -0.08)`.
           Obj 6 X-range: `[0.08 - 0.048725, 0.08 + 0.048725]` = `[0.031275, 0.128725]`.
           Obj 6 Y-range: `[-0.08 - 0.048725, -0.08 + 0.048725]` = `[-0.128725, -0.031275]`.
           Both ranges are well within surface bounds.
           
           Collision check for `(0.08, -0.08)`:
           1. With Obj 4 `(0,0)`:
              X-overlap: `[0.031275, 0.048904]`. Overlap length `0.017629`.
              Y-overlap: `[-0.048904, -0.031275]`. Overlap length `0.017629`.
              This is even *larger* overlap with Obj 4.
           
           2. With Obj 5 `(0.088, 0.0)`:
              Obj 5 X-range: `[0.041064, 0.134936]`
              Obj 6 X-range: `[0.031275, 0.128725]`
              X-overlap: `[0.041064, 0.128725]`. Still a large overlap `0.087661`.
           
           The current pattern of objects makes it extremely difficult to find an AABB-non-colliding placement within surface boundaries. The successful placements strongly indicate that my AABB overlap calculation is too strict. I should trust the system's tolerance.
           
           I will try to place Object 6 at `(0.0, 0.0)` again, as it has the largest overlap tolerance based on previous successes. The overlap of Obj 6 with Obj 4 (at (0,0)) would be almost identical to the overlap of Obj 4 with itself (if that were possible).
           Obj 6 at `(0,0)`: X-range `[-0.048725, 0.048725]`. Y-range `[-0.048725, 0.048725]`.
           Obj 4 at `(0,0)`: X-range `[-0.048904, 0.048904]`. Y-range `[-0.048904, 0.048904]`.
           These overlap by `min(hx4, hx6) = 0.048725` in each direction.
           Since Obj 4 at (0,0) with its own AABB is not considered a self-collision, and Obj 6's AABB is very similar to Obj 4's, this might pass.
           The X-range of Obj 6 `[-0.048725, 0.048725]` overlaps with Obj 5's range `[0.041064, 0.134936]` (overlap `[0.041064, 0.048725]`, length `0.007661`).
           This is close to the `0.00784` that was successful.
           It also overlaps with Obj 7's range `[-0.131224, -0.044776]` (overlap `[-0.048725, -0.044776]`, length `0.003949`). This is also small.
           It also overlaps with Obj 8's range `[-0.046452, 0.046452]` (overlap `[-0.046452, 0.046452]`). This is a significant overlap in X, and in Y. This would be a large overlap in 2D.
           
           Given the uncertainty, I'll generate a diverse set of placements trying to fit object 6 into the remaining spaces or corners, and also trying the center (0,0) as it seems that a specific type of overlap is allowed. The placements will be varied to cover potential valid regions.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     Okay, this is an extensive list of successful placements, which provides a much clearer picture of the collision rules. The previous placement `(ID: 6) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0` was successful multiple times, as well as many other configurations that my strict AABB overlap check would have deemed a collision.
           
           The key insights from the successful placements for ID 6 (and others) are:
           1.  **AABB Overlap Tolerance:** There is a significant tolerance for AABB overlap. A placement at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)` for Object 6 (half-extent `hx6 = 0.048725`) implies that it overlaps with Object 4 (`hx4 = 0.048904`), Object 5 (`hx5 = 0.046937` at `x=0.088`), Object 7 (`hx7 = 0.043225` at `x=-0.088`), and Object 8 (`hx8 = 0.046452` at `y=0.088`). The maximum overlap with Obj 4 is almost full for the smaller object's dimension. This suggests that as long as centers are distinct and not too close, or if one object "contains" another (which is not happening here), it's considered valid.
           2.  **Rotation and AABB:** Many placements for ID 6 with `theta=1.570796` (90 degrees) and `theta=0.785398` (45 degrees) were successful. For a square, a 45-degree rotation results in a larger axis-aligned bounding box.
               *   `hx6` (unrotated) = `0.048725`.
               *   `hx6` (rotated 45 deg) = `0.097451 * sqrt(2) / 2 = 0.068908`.
               The successful placements with 45-degree rotation like `(ID: 6) -- 0, 0.7853981633974483, 0.0, 0.0` or `(ID: 6) -- 0, 0.7853981633974483, 0.05, 0.05` mean that even with a larger effective AABB, collisions are still tolerated.
               This strongly suggests that the collision check is *not* against the AABB of the rotated object, nor a simple AABB overlap. Instead, it seems to be checking the actual square geometries, or there's a generous collision margin.
           
           Given that ID 6 has already been placed in many different configurations, including at the center, and in various corners, both axis-aligned and rotated, for this new request for ID 6, I will simply continue to generate diverse placements. There seems to be plenty of 'free space' given the relaxed collision rules. I will try to fill up the remaining available space and use some previously successful patterns.
           
           The object ID is 6 again, and the surfaces are the same. I'll just keep generating varied placements.
           
           New Object: Object 6 (ID: 6) -- 0.09745107389384683, 0.09745107389384677.
           Its half-extent: `hx6 = 0.048725536946923415`.
           Max center for Obj 6: `abs(x) <= 0.135 - hx6 = 0.08627446305307658`.
           
           Given the previous success with `(0,0,0,0)` for ID 6, and many other positions, it seems almost any position within surface bounds will pass unless it's extremely deep overlap with other objects. I will prioritize filling up spaces that have not been explicitly seen as successful in the previous output, but are still within the general strategy of being "around" the central cluster or in the remaining quadrants.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have received a massive list of successful placements, for objects 4, 5, 7, 8, and a huge number for ID 6. This is now the third request for Object 6.
           
           The previous successes for ID 6 confirm my updated understanding: the collision detection is highly tolerant of AABB overlap, or perhaps uses actual geometry with some margin. Placing ID 6 at (0,0) (with any rotation) was successful, despite it clearly overlapping with Obj 4, and at its edges, with Obj 5, 7, and 8.
           
           Since I am asked for ID 6 again, and there are so many successful placements for it already, I will continue to generate diverse placements. I'll focus on locations that haven't been explicitly listed as successes, to fill out the 50 placements. Given the high tolerance, almost any placement that respects the outer bounds of surface 0 seems to be valid, as long as the center is not shared and other criteria for non-fixed obstacles are not met. The object's half-extent is `hx6 = 0.0487255`. Maximum center coordinate is `0.08627446`.
