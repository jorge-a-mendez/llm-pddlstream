(Thoughts: **My Plan for Object Placement**
           
           I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for an object with ID 5 and dimensions (0.096846, 0.096846) on a square surface defined by the range  `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  Because the object is square, its bounding box remains the same regardless of its rotation.  To ensure stability, the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) must be entirely within the surface's AABB.  I've determined that the valid range for the object's center (x, y) is from -0.086576873 to 0.086576873 in both dimensions, effectively shrinking the surface boundary by half the object's size on each side.
           
           To generate 50 unique placements, I'll use a grid of x and y coordinates within this valid range.  I'll create a 7x7 grid of points, using a step size calculated to evenly divide the valid range, resulting in 49 placements. To obtain the 50th placement, I can place it in the center with a theta rotation of pi/4.
           
           Specifically, I'll:
           
           1.  Calculate the precise boundaries for x and y using the object's dimensions and surface size.
           2.  Divide the valid range (-0.086576873, 0.086576873) into 7 steps to generate 7 distinct values in the x and y dimensions.
           3.  Combine these x and y values to form 49 unique placements.
           4.  Add one more placement at the center (0, 0) with a rotation of pi/4 to reach the desired 50 stable placements.
           
           This approach will ensure that all placements are stable (fully contained within the surface) and sufficiently diverse. The surface index for all placements will be 0.

(Thoughts: **Generating Safe Placements for Object 7**
           
           Okay, so I've got this scenario: object 5 is already happily settled on surface 0, and I need to figure out where to put object 7, a little square, also on surface 0.  The tricky part?  I need to avoid any collisions with object 5.
           
           First, I quickly calculated the theoretical safe zone for object 7 *without* considering object 5. That gave me a general idea of where the object *could* go, just based on the surface size.
           
           Next, the real work: I pinpointed the exact location of object 5 on surface 0, which is currently taking up a region near the bottom left corner.  I calculated the exact bounding box of object 5.
           
           Now for the strategy: I'm generating candidate placement points for object 7, like a grid laid out on the surface. For each of these, I'm checking for overlaps with object 5's bounding box.  Since the shapes are squares, this is a relatively simple AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) overlap check, regardless of rotation, although I am also considering 45 degree rotations (pi/4).  I’m being meticulous and systematic in the collision avoidance, making sure I don’t place object 7 where it would intersect with object 5’s previously validated position.
           
           I created an 8x8 grid of potential placement locations for object 7. I then precisely calculated the coordinate thresholds where the objects would collide.
           
           I then went through my grid systematically, checking each location for collision. Those that collided, I excluded. I ended up with a list of 48 placement locations and decided to rotate two more, landing at a total of 50.
           
           Finally,  the output will include these 50 valid placements with their x, y and theta coordinates on surface 0, without any collision!

(Thoughts: **Stable Placement for Object 4 (Square)**
           
           I need to place 50 stable instances of object 4, which is essentially a square, on surface 0, avoiding collisions with the existing objects 5 and 7.  Object 4's size is approximately 0.096 units per side, meaning its half-size is about 0.048. Surface 0 spans from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  Object 5 is located at (-0.087, -0.087), and its AABB spans from (-0.135, -0.135) to (-0.038, -0.038). Object 7, positioned at (-0.094, 0.013), has an AABB from (-0.135, -0.027) to (-0.054, 0.054).
           
           To ensure stability and avoid collisions, I'll establish valid placement regions. Object 4's valid area on the surface, regardless of rotation (for now I will assume rotation is 0 degrees and re-evaluate if it does not produce valid placements), will be a smaller square inside the surface bounds, accounting for its own half-size to avoid edge containment violations.  This valid region for the center of object 4 is approximately [-0.087, 0.087] in both x and y.
           
           I'll check for collision areas for object 4 against the AABBs of both object 5 and object 7.  The collision check needs to be accurate. For object 5, assuming no rotation, the collision region for object 4's center is approximately  [-0.087, 0.010] in x and  [-0.087, 0.010] in y. For object 7, the collision region is approximately  [-0.087, -0.006] in x and [-0.075, 0.087] in y.
           
           To find valid placement locations, I'll generate a grid of potential centers within the surface bounds, with increments of roughly 0.019. I will then evaluate a collision check with object 5 and object 7 at these points. After considering AABB overlap, I identify that the collision region for object 5 fully occupies the lower-left square area. Furthermore, the collision region for object 7 takes an area above object 5. This will result in 50 distinct positions.  Thus, my final placement configuration will place object 4 at positions within the range of x = [0.0097 to 0.087] and y= [-0.087 to 0.087], or with a 0-degree rotation. All 50 placements will avoid strict AABB collisions.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition:**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm dealing with. The goal is to stably place 50 copies of Object 6 (a square, ID: 6, size about 0.074) onto Surface 0, avoiding collisions with three previously placed objects (IDs 5, 7, and 4). Surface 0 is a square area centered at the origin, ranging from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. No rotation is considered at first.
           
           **Preliminary Calculations and Constraint Definition:**
           
           First, I need to define the valid placement area for Object 6.  Based on its size, it can be centered within the surface's boundaries. I've computed the half-size of Object 6, `obj6_half_size = 0.0369`.  This gives me the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates for its center `(xc, yc)` to remain within the surface: `[-0.098, 0.098]`.
           
           **Collision Detection Logic:**
           
           The core of this problem is collision avoidance. I'm taking the conservative approach of using Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs). I've already determined the AABBs for the three existing objects (5, 7, 4) in the initial description. Now, if the center of Object 6 falls within these AABBs, there's a collision.
           
           **Collision Region Analysis:**
           
           I derived the collision regions:
           *   **C5:**  (Object 5) The center of Object 6 has to have an X-coordinate and Y-coordinate of `[-0.098, -0.0012)`.
           *   **C7:**  (Object 7) The center must be at X-coordinate of `[-0.098, -0.0166)` and an Y-coordinate of `[-0.0641, 0.0911)`.
           *   **C4:** (Object 4) The center must be at X-coordinate of `[-0.0750, 0.0944)` and an Y-coordinate of `[-0.098, -0.0024)`.
           
           **Placement Strategy:**
           
           Now, I'll systematically find valid placements that aren't in any collision region using a grid approach. I'll test points in a grid covering the valid placement area `[-0.098, 0.098]` in x and y.
           
           **Fine-Tuning the Grid:**
           
           I initially started with a grid of 8 x 8 points but quickly realized it was too coarse. It's necessary to refine the grid for accuracy. I decided on a 15x15 grid, calculated with `x_step = 0.014010361812023853` and `y_step = 0.014010361812023853` based on the surface bounds and using the coordinates to generate more points. I then generate a list of the coordinates to test.
           
           **Collision Check Implementation:**
           
           I've formulated a simple check for valid placements. A center `(xc, yc)` is valid only if these conditions are met. I go through a double loop of the coordinates generated with the steps. Then, it will determine each collision region for the x and y coordinates generated using `x_coords` and `y_coords`. After the collision is determined, the code should go back to adding the point only if it is a valid placement.
           
           **Final Steps:**
           
           I'll generate the set of valid coordinates. I have a more granular check for collisions against the AABBs of the other objects. The goal is to generate 50 points, but I'll generate more than that and truncate the array for simplicity. The result will be a list of 50 valid `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)` positions where I can place Object 6, all with `theta = 0`. This should work.

Then, it will determine each collision region for the x and y coordinates generated using `x_coords` and `y_coords`. After the collision is determined, the code should go back to adding the point only if it is a valid placement.
           
           **Final Steps:**
           
           I'll generate the set of valid coordinates. I have a more granular check for collisions against the AABBs of the other objects. The goal is to generate 50 points, but I'll generate more than that and truncate the array for simplicity. The result will be a list of 50 valid `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)` positions where I can place Object 6, all with `theta = 0`. This should work.
