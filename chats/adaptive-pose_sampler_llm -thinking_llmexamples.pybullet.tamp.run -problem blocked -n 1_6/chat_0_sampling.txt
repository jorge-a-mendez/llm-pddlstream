           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Thinking**
           
           I need to find fifty stable placements for an object on a surface. The object is a small square, 0.07 meters on each side. The surface is a rectangle with the dimensions provided. A "stable placement" means the object must be fully contained within the surface bounds.
           
           My primary approach involves understanding how rotating the object affects its bounding box. Even when rotated, the object is an Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB). I'll treat the coordinates, (x, y), as the lower-left corner of the object's axis-aligned bounding box *after* it's been rotated. This is a common interpretation. To calculate how much the object's effective dimensions expand when rotated, I used the formula: `effective_width = |size_x * cos(theta)| + |size_y * sin(theta)|`. Since the object is a square,  `effective_width = effective_height = size_x * (|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|)`.
           
           The surface is large enough to contain this object in various configurations, so I've decided to create a grid of possible placements. To increase the variety and ensure no overlaps, I'll place them at different angles (`theta`). My plan is to select several angles such as 0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and pi/2.
           
           For each angle, I will create a grid of points by incrementing x and y values in the bounds. For the placements, I'll calculate the `effective_width` and `effective_height` for each angle, then calculate the allowable range for x and y. Then I will be able to construct 50 placements. After creating the placements, I verified their positioning, bounds and number.

(Thoughts: **Revised Understanding of Object Placement**
           
           Based on the feedback and analysis of the previous request, I've corrected my understanding of the `(x, y)` coordinates in the placement format. Initially, I thought these represented the bottom-left corner of the object's AABB after rotation. However, this didn't align with the provided examples and the AABB calculations. Now, I've concluded that `(x, y)` actually represents the *center* of the object's AABB *before* rotation. This is a crucial distinction.
           
           To clarify, let's say the object is centered at `(cx, cy)` before rotation. If we rotate the object by an angle `theta`, the object's AABB's center will still be at `(cx, cy)`. The dimensions of the AABB post-rotation depend on `theta`, object size (`size_x`, `size_y`), and trigonometry:
           
           *   `effective_width = abs(size_x * cos(theta)) + abs(size_y * sin(theta))`
           *   `effective_height = abs(size_x * sin(theta)) + abs(size_y * cos(theta))`
           
           Using this adjusted interpretation, I have recalculated the AABB boundaries to ensure accurate calculations and stable placements within the given surface boundaries. I have reconfirmed my strategy with the test case and it works well. For the original request, I plan to generate 50 stable placements. I will generate them by using two key considerations: ensure that they are evenly distributed within the surface area, and rotate them using a combination of `theta=0` (straight) and `theta = pi/4` (rotated).
