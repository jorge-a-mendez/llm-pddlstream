           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 4) -- 0.0787401816425527, 0.0787401816425527)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single square surface centered at the origin. The object is also square, with sides of approximately 0.0787 units. Since the object is square, its orientation (rotation angle) does not affect its AABB. Thus, I will primarily consider an angle of 0 radians for simplicity, but also include other angles for diversity.
           
           The surface is defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           The object has dimensions `(0.0787, 0.0787)`.
           
           For the object to be stable on the surface, its center `(x, y)` must be such that:
           `lower_x_surface <= x - size_x/2` and `x + size_x/2 <= upper_x_surface`
           `lower_y_surface <= y - size_y/2` and `y + size_y/2 <= upper_y_surface`
           
           Substituting the values:
           `-0.135 <= x - 0.0787/2` => `-0.135 <= x - 0.03935` => `x >= -0.135 + 0.03935` => `x >= -0.09565`
           `x + 0.0787/2 <= 0.135` => `x + 0.03935 <= 0.135` => `x <= 0.135 - 0.03935` => `x <= 0.09565`
           So, `-0.09565 <= x <= 0.09565`.
           
           Similarly for y:
           `-0.09565 <= y <= 0.09565`.
           
           I will generate placements within these bounds, trying to cover different regions of the surface and including various angles for diversity.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still consists of a single square surface centered at the origin: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           The new object (ID: 5) is also square, with dimensions `(0.07554, 0.07554)`.
           
           The previously placed object (ID: 4) is at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`, meaning its center is at `(0.0, 0.0)` with a 0 rotation.
           Its dimensions are `(0.0787, 0.0787)`.
           This means object 4 occupies the space from `(-0.0787/2, -0.0787/2)` to `(0.0787/2, 0.0787/2)`, which is approximately `(-0.03935, -0.03935)` to `(0.03935, 0.03935)`.
           
           For the new object (ID: 5), its dimensions are `(0.07554, 0.07554)`.
           For it to be stable on the surface, its center `(x, y)` must be such that:
           `x >= -0.135 + 0.07554/2` => `x >= -0.135 + 0.03777` => `x >= -0.09723`
           `x <= 0.135 - 0.07554/2` => `x <= 0.135 - 0.03777` => `x <= 0.09723`
           So, `-0.09723 <= x <= 0.09723`.
           Similarly for y: `-0.09723 <= y <= 0.09723`.
           
           I must avoid collision with object 4, which covers `x: [-0.03935, 0.03935]` and `y: [-0.03935, 0.03935]`.
           Therefore, I should place object 5 outside this central region.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene remains the same single square surface centered at the origin: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           The new object (ID: 6) is also square, with dimensions `(0.09836, 0.09836)`.
           
           Previously placed objects:
           - Object 4 (ID: 4): `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. Dimensions: `(0.0787, 0.0787)`. Occupies `x: [-0.03935, 0.03935]`, `y: [-0.03935, 0.03935]`.
           - Object 5 (ID: 5): `(0, 0.0, 0.06, 0.0)`. Dimensions: `(0.07554, 0.07554)`. Occupies `x: [0.06 - 0.03777, 0.06 + 0.03777]` => `x: [0.02223, 0.09777]`, `y: [-0.03777, 0.03777]`.
           
           For the new object (ID: 6), its dimensions are `(0.09836, 0.09836)`.
           For it to be stable on the surface, its center `(x, y)` must be such that:
           `x >= -0.135 + 0.09836/2` => `x >= -0.135 + 0.04918` => `x >= -0.08582`
           `x <= 0.135 - 0.09836/2` => `x <= 0.135 - 0.04918` => `x <= 0.08582`
           So, `-0.08582 <= x <= 0.08582`.
           Similarly for y: `-0.08582 <= y <= 0.08582`.
           
           I must avoid collision with object 4 (`x: [-0.03935, 0.03935]`, `y: [-0.03935, 0.03935]`) and object 5 (`x: [0.02223, 0.09777]`, `y: [-0.03777, 0.03777]`).
           
           The available space for object 6 is quite limited now, especially in the x-direction.
           The combined occupied region in x for y-overlap is approximately `[-0.03935, 0.09777]`.
           This means I must place object 6 such that its x-range is outside this.
           Its x-range is `[x_center - 0.04918, x_center + 0.04918]`.
           
           If `y_center` is such that object 6 does not overlap in y with objects 4 and 5 (i.e., `y_center` such that `y_center - 0.04918 > 0.03935` or `y_center + 0.04918 < -0.03935`), then `y_center` must be `> 0.08853` or `< -0.08853`.
           Given the maximum y for object 6 is `0.08582`, this means no such non-overlapping y position exists.
           
           Therefore, object 6 will inevitably overlap in y with the previously placed objects. This means the object 6 must be placed in a region where it does not overlap in x with objects 4 or 5.
           Given the x-bounds for object 6 are `[-0.08582, 0.08582]`.
           The combined x-occupied space is approximately `[-0.03935, 0.09777]`.
           Since `0.09777 > 0.08582`, object 6 cannot be placed to the right of object 5 without collision.
           Therefore, object 6 must be placed to the left of object 4.
           This means `x_center + 0.04918 <= -0.03935` => `x_center <= -0.03935 - 0.04918` => `x_center <= -0.08853`.
           However, the allowed x-range for object 6 is `x >= -0.08582`.
           This means there is no stable placement for object 6 such that it does not collide with object 4 or 5 given the current fixed positions and the size of object 6.
           
           This is a tricky situation. I must provide 50 placements, even if I believe there are no non-colliding ones. Given the constraint, I will try to place the object in a corner that is least likely to have been taken by future (unknown) placements, or place it such that it minimally overlaps with a fixed obstacle, or just provide placements that are within the surface bounds. Since I am only given fixed obstacles and told to avoid collisions with them, and my reasoning above suggests no non-colliding placement, I will prioritize placements that are stable *on the surface* but might collide with the known fixed obstacles. The problem statement says "collision with any of the fixed obstacles", so I should try to avoid collision with objects 4 and 5. If my previous reasoning is correct, there are no such placements. However, I must always try to provide a placement. I will re-examine my reasoning.
           
           Object 4: `x` from `-0.03935` to `0.03935`, `y` from `-0.03935` to `0.03935`.
           Object 5: `x` from `0.02223` to `0.09777`, `y` from `-0.03777` to `0.03777`.
           
           New object 6: `size_x = 0.09836`. Half-size `0.04918`.
           Allowed `x_center` for surface: `[-0.08582, 0.08582]`.
           Allowed `y_center` for surface: `[-0.08582, 0.08582]`.
           
           Let's look at the x-axis.
           Combined occupied x range in the vicinity of y=0: `[-0.03935, 0.09777]`.
           This means if `y` of object 6 overlaps with `y` of object 4 or 5 (which is `[-0.03935, 0.03935]` for obj 4 and `[-0.03777, 0.03777]` for obj 5), then object 6's x-span `[x_center - 0.04918, x_center + 0.04918]` must not overlap with `[-0.03935, 0.09777]`.
           
           If `x_center + 0.04918 < -0.03935` (to the left of obj 4) => `x_center < -0.08853`.
           The minimum allowed `x_center` for object 6 is `-0.08582`. So, no non-colliding placement to the left.
           
           If `x_center - 0.04918 > 0.09777` (to the right of obj 5) => `x_center > 0.14695`.
           The maximum allowed `x_center` for object 6 is `0.08582`. So, no non-colliding placement to the right.
           
           This analysis confirms there are no placements for object 6 that are entirely non-colliding in the x-dimension, if there is any y-overlap.
           
           What if there is no y-overlap?
           Object 6 `y-span`: `[y_center - 0.04918, y_center + 0.04918]`.
           Object 4 `y-span`: `[-0.03935, 0.03935]`.
           Object 5 `y-span`: `[-0.03777, 0.03777]`.
           Combined `y-span` of placed objects: `[-0.03935, 0.03935]`.
           
           To avoid y-overlap:
           1. `y_center - 0.04918 > 0.03935` => `y_center > 0.08853`.
           2. `y_center + 0.04918 < -0.03935` => `y_center < -0.08853`.
           
           Allowed `y_center` for object 6 is `[-0.08582, 0.08582]`.
           Neither condition 1 nor 2 can be met, as `0.08853 > 0.08582` and `-0.08853 < -0.08582`.
           This means object 6 *must* overlap in y with the previously placed objects.
           
           Conclusion: Based on my geometric reasoning, there are no stable placements for object 6 that avoid collision with objects 4 and 5, given their current fixed positions and object 6's dimensions.
           
           However, the problem statement says "You never give up." and "you will always try to find a new placement." I must provide 50 placements. I will provide placements within the surface bounds, prioritizing positions that are as far as possible from the existing objects, even if they inevitably lead to a collision. Perhaps the object is allowed to be placed partially on an existing object if it is still "stable on the surface". Or, the feedback system might be forgiving. I will place it in corners and along edges of the valid surface region for object 6, as far from the current occupied central region as possible. I will try the upper-left and lower-left corners/edges first.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still consists of a single square surface centered at the origin: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           The new object (ID: 7) is also square, with dimensions `(0.097106, 0.097106)`.
           
           Previously placed objects:
           - Object 4 (ID: 4): `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. Dimensions: `(0.0787, 0.0787)`. Occupies `x: [-0.03935, 0.03935]`, `y: [-0.03935, 0.03935]`.
           - Object 5 (ID: 5): `(0, 0.0, 0.06, 0.0)`. Dimensions: `(0.07554, 0.07554)`. Occupies `x: [0.02223, 0.09777]`, `y: [-0.03777, 0.03777]`.
           - Object 6 (ID: 6): `(0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.08)`. Dimensions: `(0.09836, 0.09836)`. Occupies `x: [-0.08 - 0.04918, -0.08 + 0.04918]` => `x: [-0.12918, -0.03082]`, `y: [0.08 - 0.04918, 0.08 + 0.04918]` => `y: [0.03082, 0.12918]`.
           
           For the new object (ID: 7), its dimensions are `(0.097106, 0.097106)`. Half-size is `0.048553`.
           For it to be stable on the surface, its center `(x, y)` must be such that:
           `x >= -0.135 + 0.048553` => `x >= -0.086447`
           `x <= 0.135 - 0.048553` => `x <= 0.086447`
           So, `-0.086447 <= x <= 0.086447`.
           Similarly for y: `-0.086447 <= y <= 0.086447`.
           
           I must avoid collision with objects 4, 5, and 6.
           
           Let's look at the occupied regions:
           Obj 4: `x: [-0.03935, 0.03935]`, `y: [-0.03935, 0.03935]`
           Obj 5: `x: [0.02223, 0.09777]`, `y: [-0.03777, 0.03777]`
           Obj 6: `x: [-0.12918, -0.03082]`, `y: [0.03082, 0.12918]`
           
           The combined occupied regions are:
           - In the `y ~ 0` range (overlapping obj 4 and 5):
             `x-span`: `[-0.03935, 0.03935]` (from obj 4) UNION `[0.02223, 0.09777]` (from obj 5) = `[-0.03935, 0.09777]`
             `y-span`: `[-0.03935, 0.03935]`
           - In the `y > 0` range (overlapping obj 6):
             `x-span`: `[-0.12918, -0.03082]`
             `y-span`: `[0.03082, 0.12918]`
           
           New object 7 half-size: `0.048553`.
           New object 7 allowed `x_center`: `[-0.086447, 0.086447]`.
           New object 7 allowed `y_center`: `[-0.086447, 0.086447]`.
           
           Let's search for non-overlapping regions.
           
           1. Try to place object 7 below the existing objects (`y_center` negative).
              To avoid y-overlap with obj 4 and 5: `y_center + 0.048553 < -0.03935` => `y_center < -0.087903`.
              Allowed `y_center` for obj 7: `y_center >= -0.086447`.
              There is no `y_center` that satisfies both conditions (the lower bound for `y_center` on surface `(-0.086447)` is greater than the required bound to avoid collision `(-0.087903)`). This suggests any placement below will collide in y.
           
           2. Try to place object 7 in the `y < 0` region but possibly overlapping obj 4/5 in y.
              Consider `y_center` from `-0.086447` up to `0.0`.
              If `y_center` is e.g., `-0.08`, then `y-span` is `[-0.08 - 0.048553, -0.08 + 0.048553]` = `[-0.128553, -0.031447]`.
              This `y-span` does not overlap with any of the existing objects' `y-spans`.
              So if `y_center` is e.g. `-0.08`, the x-position can be anywhere in `[-0.086447, 0.086447]`.
              This is a promising area: `y_center` near `-0.08`, `x_center` near `0.0`.
           
           Let's define a safe `y_center`:
           A `y_center` which results in no y-overlap with 4, 5, or 6.
           Obj 4/5 y-union: `[-0.03935, 0.03935]`
           Obj 6 y-span: `[0.03082, 0.12918]`
           Union of all y-spans: `[-0.03935, 0.12918]`
           
           To avoid y-overlap:
           - `y_center + 0.048553 < -0.03935` => `y_center < -0.087903`. (No place as `y_center >= -0.086447`)
           - `y_center - 0.048553 > 0.12918` => `y_center > 0.177733`. (No place as `y_center <= 0.086447`)
           
           My reasoning implies that object 7 *must* collide with at least one existing object in the y-dimension if placed on the surface.
           This is similar to the previous request where I concluded no non-colliding placement was possible. However, the system accepted one of my "colliding" placements. This means my definition of "collision with fixed obstacles" or the system's tolerance might be different from my strict AABB intersection. I should aim for placements that minimize the overlap, or perhaps occupy a "gap" that is not fully blocked by the fixed AABBs.
           
           Given the success of `(ID: 6) -- 0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.08`, which places Object 6 in the upper-left, and Object 5 in the right, Object 4 in the center.
           The space in the lower-left, lower-right, and bottom-center still looks promising.
           
           Let's try placing object 7 in the lower-left corner (x=-0.08, y=-0.08).
           Object 7 AABB (centered at -0.08, -0.08):
           `x: [-0.08 - 0.048553, -0.08 + 0.048553]` = `[-0.128553, -0.031447]`
           `y: [-0.08 - 0.048553, -0.08 + 0.048553]` = `[-0.128553, -0.031447]`
           
           Check collision with object 4: `x: [-0.03935, 0.03935]`, `y: [-0.03935, 0.03935]`
           Object 7 x-max `(-0.031447)` is greater than object 4 x-min `(-0.03935)`. X overlap.
           Object 7 y-max `(-0.031447)` is greater than object 4 y-min `(-0.03935)`. Y overlap.
           This placement *collides* with Object 4.
           
           This is very confusing. My previous deduction that object 6 placement `(0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.08)` *would* collide, but it was successful. Let's verify object 6 and object 4 collision:
           Obj 6 AABB (from previous calculation): `x: [-0.12918, -0.03082]`, `y: [0.03082, 0.12918]`.
           Obj 4 AABB: `x: [-0.03935, 0.03935]`, `y: [-0.03935, 0.03935]`.
           Collision check:
           X-overlap: `max(obj6_xmin, obj4_xmin) = max(-0.12918, -0.03935) = -0.03935`.
           `min(obj6_xmax, obj4_xmax) = min(-0.03082, 0.03935) = -0.03082`.
           Since `-0.03935 < -0.03082`, there IS x-overlap.
           Y-overlap: `max(obj6_ymin, obj4_ymin) = max(0.03082, -0.03935) = 0.03082`.
           `min(obj6_ymax, obj4_ymax) = min(0.12918, 0.03935) = 0.03935`.
           Since `0.03082 < 0.03935`, there IS y-overlap.
           Both x and y overlap, so Object 6 *should* have collided with Object 4. But it was a success.
           
           This implies that the "fixed obstacles" might not include objects that I placed in previous steps, or the collision detection logic is different (e.g., it only considers the exact center or primary dimensions, not the full AABB for collision with previously placed items). Or, the "fixed obstacles" are some implicit objects in the environment that I am not explicitly aware of.
           Given the phrasing "the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene", it sounds like the fixed obstacles are *only* the geometry given by the surfaces. However, it also says "you must avoid collision between objects i and j" (for different IDs). This is a contradiction.
           
           If objects 4, 5, 6 are truly "fixed obstacles" and my AABB collision check is correct, then there are no non-colliding placements for object 7.
           However, I must assume the system expects a valid placement. The most likely explanation is that the previously placed objects are *not* considered "fixed obstacles" for collision detection in the same way the surfaces are. Or, the system's collision detection is more permissive.
           
           I will interpret "avoid collision between objects i and j" to mean that I should avoid *significant* overlap if possible, but if strict AABB non-overlap is impossible, I must still propose placements that are valid on the surface and perhaps minimally overlap with existing objects. Since the success of obj 6 suggests some tolerance, I will continue to propose placements that are valid for the surface and are as far as possible from existing objects.
           
           Let's try the bottom-right for object 7.
           `x_center = 0.08`, `y_center = -0.08`.
           Object 7 AABB (centered at 0.08, -0.08):
           `x: [0.08 - 0.048553, 0.08 + 0.048553]` = `[0.031447, 0.128553]`
           `y: [-0.08 - 0.048553, -0.08 + 0.048553]` = `[-0.128553, -0.031447]`
           
           Check collision with object 4: `x: [-0.03935, 0.03935]`, `y: [-0.03935, 0.03935]`
           X-overlap: `max(obj7_xmin, obj4_xmin) = max(0.031447, -0.03935) = 0.031447`.
           `min(obj7_xmax, obj4_xmax) = min(0.128553, 0.03935) = 0.03935`.
           Since `0.031447 < 0.03935`, there IS x-overlap.
           Y-overlap: `max(obj7_ymin, obj4_ymin) = max(-0.128553, -0.03935) = -0.03935`.
           `min(obj7_ymax, obj4_ymax) = min(-0.031447, 0.03935) = -0.031447`.
           Since `-0.03935 < -0.031447`, there IS y-overlap.
           This placement *collides* with Object 4.
           
           Check collision with object 5: `x: [0.02223, 0.09777]`, `y: [-0.03777, 0.03777]`
           X-overlap: `max(obj7_xmin, obj5_xmin) = max(0.031447, 0.02223) = 0.031447`.
           `min(obj7_xmax, obj5_xmax) = min(0.128553, 0.09777) = 0.09777`.
           Since `0.031447 < 0.09777`, there IS x-overlap.
           Y-overlap: `max(obj7_ymin, obj5_ymin) = max(-0.128553, -0.03777) = -0.03777`.
           `min(obj7_ymax, obj5_ymax) = min(-0.031447, 0.03777) = -0.031447`.
           Since `-0.03777 < -0.031447`, there IS y-overlap.
           This placement *collides* with Object 5.
           
           Given that all corners and even central placements will collide based on AABB overlap, I will provide placements in the valid surface region `x,y in [-0.086447, 0.086447]` focusing on the lower part of the surface, trying to diversify the positions and angles.

           It appears the system can track multiple instances of the same ID, or perhaps the multiple successful placements for the same ID represent alternative placements tried. Since the prompt says "You may reuse these as positive examples for future requests", I will consider these as separate "fixed obstacles" now, or at least learn the geometry of the scene based on them. However, since they have the same ID, it's more likely they are just alternative successful placements from a previous round for that object. I will assume the system is testing one instance of each ID at a time, and the "fixed obstacles" are the most recent successful placement for each ID. So, I will use the *last* successful placement for each ID as the "fixed obstacles".
           
           Revised "fixed obstacles" from previous successful placements:
           - Object 4 (ID: 4): `(0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.0)`. Dimensions: `(0.0787, 0.0787)`. AABB: `x: [0.01065, 0.08935]`, `y: [-0.03935, 0.03935]`.
           - Object 5 (ID: 5): `(0, 0.0, -0.06, 0.0)`. Dimensions: `(0.07554, 0.07554)`. AABB: `x: [-0.09777, -0.02223]`, `y: [-0.03777, 0.03777]`.
           - Object 6 (ID: 6): `(0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.08)`. Dimensions: `(0.09836, 0.09836)`. AABB: `x: [-0.12918, -0.03082]`, `y: [0.03082, 0.12918]`.
           - Object 7 (ID: 7): `(0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.08)`. Dimensions: `(0.097106, 0.097106)`. AABB: `x: [-0.048553, 0.048553]`, `y: [-0.128553, -0.031447]`.
           
           For the new object (ID: 8), its dimensions are `(0.097416, 0.097416)`. Half-size is `0.048708`.
           For it to be stable on the surface, its center `(x, y)` must be such that:
           `x >= -0.135 + 0.048708` => `x >= -0.086292`
           `x <= 0.135 - 0.048708` => `x <= 0.086292`
           So, `-0.086292 <= x <= 0.086292`.
           Similarly for y: `-0.086292 <= y <= 0.086292`.
           
           Let's check for collision avoidance.
           Combined occupied regions (AABBs):
           - Obj 4: `x: [0.01065, 0.08935]`, `y: [-0.03935, 0.03935]`
           - Obj 5: `x: [-0.09777, -0.02223]`, `y: [-0.03777, 0.03777]`
           - Obj 6: `x: [-0.12918, -0.03082]`, `y: [0.03082, 0.12918]`
           - Obj 7: `x: [-0.048553, 0.048553]`, `y: [-0.128553, -0.031447]`
           
           Available regions (rough estimate):
           Looking at the y-axis:
           - Above `y = 0.12918`: No space for obj 8 (`y_center + 0.048708 > 0.12918` => `y_center > 0.080472`. Max `y_center` for obj 8 is `0.086292`. So there's a small sliver.)
           - Below `y = -0.128553`: No space for obj 8 (`y_center - 0.048708 < -0.128553` => `y_center < -0.079845`. Min `y_center` for obj 8 is `-0.086292`. So there's a small sliver.)
           
           Let's examine the corners for object 8.
           Upper-right corner: `x_center = 0.08`, `y_center = 0.08`.
           Obj 8 AABB: `x: [0.031292, 0.128708]`, `y: [0.031292, 0.128708]`.
           - Collides with Obj 4? No Y overlap (`y_min 0.031292` > `y_max 0.03935` but they are close). The Y range of object 4 is `[-0.03935, 0.03935]`. The Y range of object 8 is `[0.031292, 0.128708]`. There is Y overlap `[0.031292, 0.03935]`. X overlap: `max(0.031292, 0.01065) = 0.031292`, `min(0.128708, 0.08935) = 0.08935`. So there is X overlap. So this collides with Obj 4.
           
           The problem states "if a placement fails multiple times, it is likely that there is a collision that you are not aware of". The successful placement of ID 6 `(0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.08)` and ID 7 `(0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.08)` implies that some AABB overlaps *are* allowed by the system.
           Let's re-examine ID 6's AABB (`x: [-0.12918, -0.03082]`, `y: [0.03082, 0.12918]`) and ID 4's AABB (`x: [0.01065, 0.08935]`, `y: [-0.03935, 0.03935]`).
           There is no overlap between 6 and 4. My previous calculation for ID 4 was `(0.0, 0.0)` which had `x: [-0.03935, 0.03935]`. With the update to `(0.05, 0.0)` for obj 4, its x-range is now `[0.01065, 0.08935]`. So it no longer overlaps with obj 6. This is key. The collision logic of the system is clearer now. It uses the *latest successful placement for each ID* as the fixed obstacles.
           
           Let's restart the collision check with the latest successful placements:
           Obj 4 (ID: 4): `(0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.0)`. AABB: `x: [0.01065, 0.08935]`, `y: [-0.03935, 0.03935]`.
           Obj 5 (ID: 5): `(0, 0.0, -0.06, 0.0)`. AABB: `x: [-0.09777, -0.02223]`, `y: [-0.03777, 0.03777]`.
           Obj 6 (ID: 6): `(0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.08)`. AABB: `x: [-0.12918, -0.03082]`, `y: [0.03082, 0.12918]`.
           Obj 7 (ID: 7): `(0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.08)`. AABB: `x: [-0.048553, 0.048553]`, `y: [-0.128553, -0.031447]`.
           
           New object (ID: 8) half-size: `0.048708`.
           Valid surface placement for center `(x, y)`:
           `x: [-0.086292, 0.086292]`
           `y: [-0.086292, 0.086292]`
           
           Let's find non-overlapping regions for Object 8's AABB `[x_c - 0.048708, x_c + 0.048708]` and `[y_c - 0.048708, y_c + 0.048708]`.
           
           Consider the gap between objects.
           Looking at Y-axis:
           Obj 4, 5: `y: [-0.03935, 0.03935]` (union is same range since obj 5 is narrower)
           Obj 6: `y: [0.03082, 0.12918]`
           Obj 7: `y: [-0.128553, -0.031447]`
           
           Union of all y-spans: `[-0.128553, 0.12918]`.
           The object 8 `y-span` must avoid this.
           If `y_c + 0.048708 < -0.128553` => `y_c < -0.177261`. (Not possible given `y_c >= -0.086292`).
           If `y_c - 0.048708 > 0.12918` => `y_c > 0.177888`. (Not possible given `y_c <= 0.086292`).
           This implies any y-placement will collide with some existing object. My AABB intersection logic seems correct, and the "successes" are still contradictory if AABB overlap is strictly forbidden.
           
           Could it be that "fixed obstacles" refers to the scene geometry, and "collision between objects i and j" implies AABB collision with previously placed objects that also became "fixed obstacles" (but with some tolerance)?
           Given previous successes, it implies a placement that overlaps might still be accepted. I will aim for a placement that fills "empty" space as much as possible, focusing on positions with minimal AABB overlap with existing "fixed" objects if full non-overlap is impossible.
           
           Let's look for large gaps in the x-dimension for y-ranges.
           In the y-range of `[-0.03935, 0.03935]` (where obj 4 and 5 are), the x-ranges are:
           Obj 4: `[0.01065, 0.08935]`
           Obj 5: `[-0.09777, -0.02223]`
           The gap in between is roughly `(-0.02223, 0.01065)`.
           The x-range for obj 8 (`x_c - 0.048708, x_c + 0.048708`).
           If I place `x_c = 0.0`, then x-range is `[-0.048708, 0.048708]`. This spans the gap and overlaps with both obj 4 and 5.
           
           Let's try placement in corners of the *available* surface for ID 8:
           Valid region `x: [-0.086292, 0.086292]`, `y: [-0.086292, 0.086292]`.
           
           Placement: `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`
           AABB: `x: [-0.048708, 0.048708]`, `y: [-0.048708, 0.048708]`.
           - Overlaps Obj 4 (`x: [0.01065, 0.08935]`, `y: [-0.03935, 0.03935]`). Yes, both x and y overlap.
           - Overlaps Obj 5 (`x: [-0.09777, -0.02223]`, `y: [-0.03777, 0.03777]`). Yes, both x and y overlap.
           - Overlaps Obj 6 (`x: [-0.12918, -0.03082]`, `y: [0.03082, 0.12918]`). X overlap, no Y overlap.
           - Overlaps Obj 7 (`x: [-0.048553, 0.048553]`, `y: [-0.128553, -0.031447]`). Y overlap, X overlap.
           
           It seems I will always have AABB collisions. I will provide placements that are valid on the surface and try to place them in locations that have not been "recently successful" for other objects, or where the "collision" could be minimal.
           
           One interesting spot is the bottom-right for ID 8.
           `(0, 0.0, 0.08, -0.08)`
           AABB: `x: [0.031292, 0.128708]`, `y: [-0.128708, -0.031292]`.
           - Obj 4 (`x: [0.01065, 0.08935]`, `y: [-0.03935, 0.03935]`):
             X-overlap: `max(0.031292, 0.01065)=0.031292`, `min(0.128708, 0.08935)=0.08935`. Overlap.
             Y-overlap: `max(-0.128708, -0.03935)=-0.03935`, `min(-0.031292, 0.03935)=-0.031292`. Overlap.
             Collides with Obj 4.
           
           I must interpret "avoid collision between objects i and j" more loosely. I will generate positions covering the allowed surface area, trying various angles. I will slightly favor areas that might be less "dense" with existing object overlaps.
           Since 6 is top-left and 7 is bottom-center, and 4 and 5 are somewhat central-right and central-left, maybe the top-right corner or the bottom-left corner that had a previous success for ID 6.
           
           Let's try top-right for object 8.
           `(0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.08)`
           AABB: `x: [0.031292, 0.128708]`, `y: [0.031292, 0.128708]`.
           - Obj 4 (`x: [0.01065, 0.08935]`, `y: [-0.03935, 0.03935]`): X overlap `[0.031292, 0.08935]`. Y overlap `[0.031292, 0.03935]`. Collides.
           - Obj 5 (`x: [-0.09777, -0.02223]`, `y: [-0.03777, 0.03777]`): No X overlap. Y overlap `[0.031292, 0.03777]`. Collides.
           - Obj 6 (`x: [-0.12918, -0.03082]`, `y: [0.03082, 0.12918]`): No X overlap. Y overlap `[0.031292, 0.128708]` and `[0.03082, 0.12918]` for obj 6. YES, Y overlap `[0.031292, 0.128708]`. Collides.
           - Obj 7 (`x: [-0.048553, 0.048553]`, `y: [-0.128553, -0.031447]`): No X or Y overlap. No collision.
           
           So, if placed at `(0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.08)`, object 8 collides with 4, 5, 6, but not 7.
           
           This is a problem that requires an assumption about the collision model. Given that I must not give up, and I must provide 50 placements, I will generate a diverse set of placements within the surface bounds, trying to minimize AABB overlaps when possible, but accepting that some overlap seems to be part of the successful placements. I'll prioritize filling the empty regions first.
