User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is enclosed by walls at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5, as seen from AABBs 1-4. There's also a central wall along the y-axis at x=0 (AABB 5). Other AABBs represent smaller obstacles within the environment. I need to find 3 positions within a 2-unit radius of the target point, avoiding these obstacles. I will aim for diverse positions around the target point.
           
           Positions:
           (0.0 0.0)
           (0.0 0.0)
           (0.0 0.0)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     The previous positions (0.0, 0.0) all failed because they collided with AABB 5, which is a wall at x=0. The target point is (-0.58, 2.11). Since x=0 is a wall, I need to make sure the proposed base positions are on the same side of the wall as the target point, or at least avoid crossing it or being on it. The target is in the negative x half of the room. I will try positions that are to the left of x=0 and within range of the target.
