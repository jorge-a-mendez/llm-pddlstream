User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Navigating the Labyrinth: My Strategy for Robot Base Placement**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a challenging task: pinpoint 25 possible locations for a robot base, all while considering a few crucial constraints. The goal is to place the robot within a 4-unit radius of a given target point, restricted to a square workspace defined by x: [-2.5, 2.5] and y: [-2.5, 2.5], and most importantly, ensure it has an unobstructed line of sight to the target while cleverly avoiding any fixed obstacles.
           
           The landscape is a well-defined room, boxed in by walls and a few smaller obstacles. The initial plan involves analyzing the known fixed obstacles – like the outer walls and a significant vertical obstruction at x=0. The main difficulty here is to balance line-of-sight and obstacle avoidance.
           
           The real snag appears when the target point is *within* an obstacle, especially the vertical wall at x=0. My interpretation here is crucial. I must consider the target point, denoted `T`, as being located within an obstruction `Obstacle_k`. In this special scenario, I'm assuming that line-of-sight to the target is still valid if the robot, `P`, is *also* inside this same obstacle – it's like we're looking through a transparent obstruction. As well, I'm assuming it's not a collision since that, again, makes the task impossible.
           
           With that understanding, and given the target coordinate `(0, 0)`, I needed to place the robot base along `x = [-0.05, 0.05]` to have unobstructed access. I'll focus on varying the robot's y coordinates to find a diverse set of coordinates. The key here is balance — finding 25 distinct locations that provide this unobstructed view, while complying with the established constraints.

(Thoughts: **Revised Strategy for Robot Positioning**
           
           Okay, based on the previous feedback and my analysis, here's my updated approach. The key is to correctly interpret the obstacle collisions and adapt my positioning accordingly.
           
           The critical insight is that the "vertical wall" at x=0 (obstacle 5 in the initial definition) is *impassable* for the robot.  The feedback consistently labeled this wall as "obstacle 0" (which is actually a re-labeling of obstacle 5), and reports collisions when the robot attempts to occupy that space.  For the target (1.9, -2.0), this means I *must* place the robot on the right side of the x=0 wall (px > 0.05) to ensure line-of-sight and avoid collisions.  Previous attempts failed because I was trying positions within that critical obstacle.
           
           The new target point is (1.9, -2.0). My goal is to find 25 valid robot positions (px, py) to satisfy these constraints:
           
           1.  **World Limits:** The robot must stay within the room: px in [-2.5, 2.5], py in [-2.5, 2.5].
           2.  **No Collision with Obstacle 5:**  px must not be in [-0.05, 0.05] because of the wall. With the target at x=1.9, the robot *must* have px > 0.05 to have line-of-sight.
           3.  **Maximum Range:** The distance between the robot and the target must be <= 4.  sqrt((px - 1.9)^2 + (py + 2.0)^2) <= 4.
           4. **No Collisions with Other Obstacles:** Avoid other obstacles listed in the original problem description.
           
           I've carefully considered the other obstacles present: walls, and smaller boxes in the scene. I've re-reviewed the coordinates of all obstacles to make sure I don't inadvertently select a position inside one. My plan to achieve this is the following:
           
           *   I'll define the relevant region where the robot can be placed using the constraints: px in `(0.05, 2.5]`, py in `[-2.5, 2.0]` (because the max range is 4 from target (1.9, -2)).
           *   I've set my px and py intervals to make 25 points. My values will be:  `px: [0.1, 0.7, 1.3, 1.9, 2.4]` and `py: [-2.4, -1.6, -0.8, 0.0, 0.8]`.
           *   Then I will filter the generated 25 points against the other obstacles.
           
           This approach should give me the 25 required positions, respecting both the immediate proximity around the target, and providing a variety of viewing angles.
