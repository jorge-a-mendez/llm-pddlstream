User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.321, 0.246), (-4.226, 0.341)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.274, 0.294, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.858, 0.514).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom stackable(v15, v10)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom stackable(v8, v18)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)
           Atom graspable(v15)
           Atom type(v8, v17)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom type(v12, v17)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v14)
           Atom stackable(v12, v18)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom pose(v15, v16)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Action Restrictions**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a certain type, specifically `?green`, *on* `v18`. I first look for objects that meet the `type(?green, v17)` criteria, and find two candidates: `v8` and `v12`.  The "on" predicate is derived through *supported* and *atpose* predicates. I need either `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)`. Given that `v18` is a surface and both objects are `stackable` on `v18`, it seems I simply need to move one of them there.
           
           I decide to focus on getting `v8` on `v18`.  `v8` is currently on `v11`. To get `v8` on `v18`, I need to have `atpose(v8, ?p_new)` and `supported(v8, ?p_new, v18)`. Fortunately, I see that `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is already true. Therefore, my plan boils down to obtaining `atpose(v8, #o2)`.
           
           The standard approach would involve *pick* and *place* actions. However, here's where the problem arises. I analyze the *pick* action. To execute it, I need `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, ?t_pick_v8)`.  This *kin* fact isn't in my initial state, and crucially, I am *only* allowed to use action instances explicitly listed.  The problem explicitly states that "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is *false*." Further, I'm only given one action `move_base`.
           
           The constraint is extremely tight: I am confined to only using `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. The `move_base` action doesn't touch the *on* predicate at all. In light of these constraints, the problem is that because no `pick` or `place` actions are available, I cannot alter the *atpose* predicate. This is a dead end. I cannot change the existing *on* predicates, and I cannot create new *on* predicates. Consequently, the goal, `new-axiom@0()`, is simply unreachable given the allowed actions.
