User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object

           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.321, 0.246), (-4.226, 0.341)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.274, 0.294, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.858, 0.514).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Goal: new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially means getting either object `v8` or `v12` onto `v18` and ensuring they're of type `v17`. Luckily, the type check is already handled, so it's a matter of getting *one* of them onto `v18`.
           
           Looking at the world state, both `v8` and `v12` *can* be placed on `v18`, with appropriate poses. Examining the supporting predicate, `supported(?o, #o2, v18)`, I have support for either `v8` and `v12` supported at some pose `#o2` on `v18`, so either is acceptable!
           
           Now, the plan: First, I'm thinking of picking up `v8` from its current location at pose `v9`, or `v12` from `v13`. Since the problem hints that we should choose the "closest" object, and robot base *seems* to be at `v3` for all operations, I will pick up `v8`. The actions are kinematically linked to grasp points that are precomputed (so I don't need to specify these).
           
           To pick, I'll use the *pick* action, which *requires* the robot's base to be at configuration `atbconf(#o3)`. We also need to consider collision avoidance. Initial state has `atbconf(v3)`, and the only motion is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, with a cost of 0 distance traveled.  This base motion does not appear to change the base configuration, thus I'll assume that the pose `#o3` can be mapped to an existing object/pose `v3` where the base configuration is already true. Therefore, the pick can be executed. Also, unsafe approach conditions are not given, thus will be assumed collision free. After picking up the object the grasp is then true and the pose `atpose` will be false. The object needs to have a kinematic action defined.
           
           Then, I'll place `v8` at the appropriate pose `#o2` on `v18` using a *place* action. The place preconditions are similar, and again, I can *assume* it's collision-free unless proven otherwise by the absence of collision values. Assuming `#o3` maps to `v3`, the robot base configuration will remain fixed (collision checked as above).
           
           For the pose of the surface, as long as it isn't an invalid movement, the height on the surface, or the x-y coordinate on the surface does not matter. The place operation must be kinematically defined and therefore no additional movement will be required. After placing the object, `atpose(v8, #o2)` is true, and the robot base remains in place.
           
           After place, the key facts hold. Now `on(v8, v18)` is true. Given the type information, I have achieved the axiom to true. And I also have verified that I'm not moving the base.
           
           The total cost will be `pickcost() + placecost() = 1 + 1 = 2`. The values for the grasp and the trajectories, are assumed. `#o2 v8 v18` will represent the required pose.
           
           And with that, I believe I have a viable plan!

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment: The Goal is Unreachable**
           
           Okay, so the user pointed out a problem with the previous plan, and they were right. The only valid action I have at my disposal is `move_base`, and the only action instance I was given was `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  Essentially, that does nothing. The cost is 0, since I'm not moving at all.
           
           My ultimate goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having something green on `v18`.  More specifically, I need to get either `v8` or `v12` onto `v18`.  To achieve that, I *need* to satisfy the `on(?o, ?r)` predicate.  This requires both `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`. Luckily, my initial state already gives me `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`.
           
           So, the crux of the issue boils down to getting `atpose(v8, #o2)` or `atpose(v12, #o2)` to be true. The problem?  I can *only* use `move_base`. I don't have access to `pick` or `place`, which are essential for manipulating objects' poses.  The initial state provides `atpose(v15, v16)`, `atpose(v8, v9)`, and `atpose(v12, v13)`, but nothing is at pose `#o2`.
           
           Therefore, given the constraints – only `move_base` and no initial `atpose` facts that satisfy my needs – I can confidently say that the goal is currently *unreachable*. I need to rethink the problem with a different set of actions or modify the initial state.
