           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable: Insufficient Action Set**
           
           Okay, so I've been presented with a problem in the `rovers` domain: to achieve `new-axiom@0()`.  Let me break down what that means.  Basically, I need to satisfy a conjunction of conditions.  First, the initial configuration of the rovers is already valid, so that's good. The crux of the problem lies in the need to receive images and analyses: I'm dealing with `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates.  Specifically, I need to receive images from objectives v17, v18, v19, and v20 with mode v11.  I also need the analyses of rocks of type v2 and rocks of type v6.
           
           To unpack those requirements, I'd normally think in terms of actions: take an image, send the image, sample a rock, analyze it, and then send the analysis.  From my experience in this domain, I know this requires several intermediary actions such as `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`, which implicitly require the `calibrate` action. These actions aren't directly available for use, however.
           
           Looking at the initial state, I can see what I have to work with. There are rocks and their types available (v1-v8, v2, v6). The issue becomes clear when I examine the constraints. The problem statement *explicitly* limits me to a provided list of "valid action instances." The rules are strict: only the actions in this list are permitted.
           
           Now, that's where the problem arises.  The only action instances I *can* use are two no-op `move` actions which don't modify the initial configuration or enable other actions. There are also two `drop_rock` actions, but they require the store to be full, which it isn't, so they are not applicable at this stage.
           
           Crucially, the list is missing the actions I absolutely need: `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`.  Without them, I can't fulfill any of the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` conditions.
           
           Therefore, given the constraints on the allowed actions, and that I must execute only action instances in the provided list, I can definitively state that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently *unachievable*. The specified actions are necessary for success, and they are absent from my toolkit.
