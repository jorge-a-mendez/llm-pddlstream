           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of Achieving `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, I've got a goal, `new-axiom@0()`, which looks like a conjunction of several conditions. My immediate thought is to break it down and check if those conditions are already satisfied in the initial state. The first four conditions (`atconf`, `atconf`, `free`, `free`) are indeed true initially, which is a good start.
           
           The real challenge lies with `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`. To achieve these, I'd need to use actions like `send_image` and `send_analysis`. However, the prompt is throwing a curveball: it's also providing a limited list of *allowed* action instances – `move` and `drop_rock`. No `send_image`, no `send_analysis`, nothing that can directly cause `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           
           I tried to construct a plan, starting with how to achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)`. It looks like I would need to use `take_image` followed by `send_image`. But wait, `take_image` and `send_image` are *not* on the allowed action list!  The same for `send_analysis`. This is a significant problem.
           
           I went back and checked the preconditions. For `take_image`, I need the camera to be calibrated. I *could* potentially use `calibrate` if it was available, but it isn't. The only actions are `move` and `drop_rock`, and neither of them will get me to the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` conditions.
           
           It's clear, given the very restrictive list of permitted actions and the goal's requirements, that *this* goal is currently unachievable. There's just no way to get the images and analysis needed with the tools provided. Those constraints are absolute.
