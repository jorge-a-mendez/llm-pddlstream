           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unachievable Given Constraints**
           
           My initial analysis focused on breaking down the `new-axiom@0()` goal into its individual components. I identified the necessary steps to achieve each part of the conjunction, including sending images and analyzing rocks. I mapped out a potential plan involving two rovers, V12 and V14, to accomplish the tasks efficiently. I recognized the need to calibrate, take images, send images, sample rocks, and send analysis, making sure to drop the sampled rock at the end. However, I soon hit a major roadblock.
           
           The crucial issue is the constraint on allowable actions. I was explicitly informed that only the action instances provided in a specific list could be used. Upon careful examination, this list *did not* include the actions needed to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` goal. The provided action list only includes actions to move the rovers and to drop rocks.
           
           Since the required actions (`send_image`, `send_analysis`, and their prerequisites) are unavailable, I'm forced to conclude the goal is **unachievable** given these constraints. I verified the presence of the static goals in the initial state, verified what would be needed to get the dynamic goal. The dynamic goal requires actions that are not present.
