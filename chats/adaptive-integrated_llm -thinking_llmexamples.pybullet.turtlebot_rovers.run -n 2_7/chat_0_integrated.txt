           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable Due to Action Instance Restrictions**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with planning a solution to achieve `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain.  I started by breaking down the conditions: rovers at certain configurations, free stores, image and analysis reception, and identifying types of objects (stone and soil) that *have* been analyzed.  I quickly realized the crucial aspect: I'm restricted to a very *specific* list of action instances.
           
           Analyzing the initial state, I confirmed that rovers and stores were in the correct initial conditions, and that rocks and soil were of the expected types. The problem, though, centers around getting those images and analyses *received*.
           
           I then checked the allowed actions:  a bunch of `move` (but no-op) actions and some `drop_rock` actions. The `drop_rock` actions are useless since the stores start *free*, not full.  This is where the problem becomes clear.  I need actions *not* listed in the provided instance-list, specifically `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. These missing actions are fundamental to achieving the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` conditions.
           
           Therefore, since the only valid actions are no-ops and preconditions-not-met, the goal, as defined, is simply unattainable with the restrictions. I can't generate the *necessary* states for image and analysis.  So, I must explain why this goal is not achievable, rather than trying to build a non-existent plan. The problem boils down to a fundamental mismatch between the required actions and the permitted actions. The goal is unreachable.
