           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Alright, here's my breakdown of how I'd approach this problem.** The core of the issue is to figure out a plan that satisfies the `new-axiom@0()` goal in the `rovers` domain, which, essentially, involves making sure both rovers take images, send them, analyze a stone and soil sample, and then return to their initial positions with their stores empty. Seems straightforward at first glance, but the initial state and the intricacies of these "continuous parameters" – positions – are where things get tricky.
           
           First, I looked at the axiom and broke it down to the essential conditions I need to satisfy: *Get images, send those images, analyze a stone, analyze soil, and importantly, have the rovers return to their starting configuration (and empty stores)*. Four of the initial conditions (atconf and free facts) have to still be true at the final state.
           
           The key to it all is figuring out the continuous parameters: the coordinates. There are some "initial states" I have to respect and work with in the planning process. Let's list these and make sure the actions make sense! The plan consists of two sequences of actions for each rover.
           
           **Rover v12's plan is as follows:**
           1.  Move to a configuration *#o3* - to be able to take an image of `v17`. (`move v12 v13 #o2 #o3`)
           2.  Calibrate its camera for that pose. (`calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10`)
           3.  Take an image (`take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11`).
           4.  Move to another configuration *#o0* for communication. (`move v12 #o3 #o2 #o0`)
           5.  Send the image to the lander (`send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11`).
           6.  Move to a third pose *#o5*. (`move v12 #o0 #o2 #o5`)
           7.  Sample the specified stone (`sample_rock v12 #o5 v3 v16`).
           8.  Move back to pose #o0. (`move v12 #o5 #o2 #o0`)
           9.  Send the analysis. (`send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v3`)
           10. Drop the rock to make store free. (`drop_rock v12 v16`)
           11. Return to its initial configuration *v13* (`move v12 #o0 #o2 v13`)
           
           **Rover v14's plan is the same, in sequence, for the other conditions**
           
           1.  Move to a configuration *#o3* - to be able to take an image of `v18`.
           2.  Calibrate its camera for that pose.
           3.  Take an image
           4.  Move to another configuration *#o0* for communication.
           5.  Send the image to the lander.
           6.  Move to a third pose *#o5*.
           7.  Sample the specified soil.
           8.  Move back to pose #o0.
           9.  Send the analysis.
           10. Drop the soil.
           11. Return to its initial configuration *v15*.
           
           Here's the key to making this all work:
           
           -   **Image Configurations (#o3):** I defined two #o3 configurations – one for each rover, so that each rover can take their image (v17 for v12 and v18 for v14). In each case, it has to be close enough to have the `imagevisible` fact be true! I tried to pick reasonable values with this. It's a key requirement of the "continuous parameters". These are `(-0.68, 0.5)` for `#o3 v12 v17` and `(-1.5, 0.0)` for `#o3 v14 v18`.
           
           -   **Communication Configurations (#o0):** I set communication poses for each rover to `(0.0, -1.75)` for `v12` and `(-1.0, -1.75)` for `v14`.  These meet the `comvisible` predicates and make sure each rover is close enough to send its data to the lander. This location also has to be accessible to the rover.
           
           -   **Sampling Configurations (#o5):** I can now choose the continuous parameters for `#o5`, these are locations to enable the rovers to use the `above` predicate

           7.  Sample the specified stone (`sample_rock v12 #o5 v3 v16`).
           8.  Move back to pose #o0. (`move v12 #o5 #o2 #o0`)

           11. Return to its initial configuration *v13* (`move v12 #o0 #o2 v13`)
           
           **Rover v14's plan is the same, in sequence, for the other conditions**
           
           1.  Move to a configuration *#o3* - to be able to take an image of `v18`.
           2.  Calibrate its camera for that pose.
           3.  Take an image
           4.  Move to another configuration *#o0* for communication.
           5.  Send the image to the lander.

           7.  Sample the specified soil.
           8.  Move back to pose #o0.
           9.  Send the analysis.
           10. Drop the soil.
           11. Return to its initial configuration *v15*.
           
           Here's the key to making this all work:
           
           -   **Image Configurations (#o3):** I defined two #o3 configurations – one for each rover, so that each rover can take their image (v17 for v12 and v18 for v14). In each case, it has to be close enough to have the `imagevisible` fact be true! I tried to pick reasonable values with this. It's a key requirement of the "continuous parameters". These are `(-0.68, 0.5)` for `#o3 v12 v17` and `(-1.5, 0.0)` for `#o3 v14 v18`.
           
           -   **Communication Configurations (#o0):** I set communication poses for each rover to `(0.0, -1.75)` for `v12` and `(-1.0, -1.75)` for `v14`.  These meet the `comvisible` predicates and make sure each rover is close enough to send its data to the lander. This location also has to be accessible to the rover.
           
           -   **Sampling Configurations (#o5):** I can now choose the continuous parameters for `#o5`, these are locations to enable the rovers to use the `above` predicate

User:      Configuration #o3 = (-0.68 0.5) for rover v12 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (0.0 -1.75) for rover v12 at target v9 is in collision with the following fixed obstacles:
           
           ```
           v19: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Plan Refinement: Recalculating Problematic Configurations**
           
           Okay, so the original plan hit a snag with a couple of configuration issues. Specifically, `#o3` for rover `v12` wasn't reachable, and the initial choice for `#o0` for `v12` collided with `v19`. My approach is to revisit these problematic configurations, ensuring they are valid while leaving the rest of the plan untouched.
           
           First, let's address `#o3` for `v12`, the configuration needed to visually target `v17`. After initial analysis, I realized I incorrectly assumed `#o3` was a placeholder that needed to be found. The problem statement explicitly states that if a config is in the initial state and appears in an `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, I *must* use the given one. It just needs a valid value. My re-evaluation shows `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `conf(v12, #o3)`, and `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)` all exist in the initial state, indicating  `#o3` is designed for v12 and v17, and a valid path exists. I've re-calculated a suitable value to satisfy all constraints. The initial attempt `(-0.68, 0.5)` was blocked. By placing `v12` at  `(-0.7, 1.0)`, `v12` will be within range, collision-free with `v19` AABB, and the view to `v17` won't be blocked. A quick distance check confirms this and is reachable from v13.
           
           Next, I need to resolve the collision detected at  `#o0` for `v12`, aiming to be  `comvisible` to `v9`. My original guess was `(0.0, -1.75)` and it collided with `v19` at AABB `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`. After more calculation, placing `v12` at `(-1.0, -2.0)` should be collision-free with `v19` and visible to `v9`. The ray from `(-1.0, -2.0)` to the centroid of `v9` is also clear. Therefore, I've re-assigned  `#o0` for `v12` to `(-1.0, -2.0)`.
           
           Regarding the configurations for `v14` (the other rover) and the sampling positions: all those remain valid. Specifically, I've confirmed that  `#o3` for `v14` remains valid at  `(-1.5, 0.0)` for viewing `v18`, and  `#o0` for `v14` at  `(-1.0, -1.75)` for `v9` remains good. The rover hovering positions, `#o5` for `v12` at  `(2.16, 1.04)` and for `v14` at  `(-1.99, 0.54)`, respectively, above their targets also remain collision-free with  `v19`.
           
           Finally, I checked all the  `motion` facts associated with each rover. With the new positions, the plan's motion flows. I am confident that these new configurations will resolve the issues, and the revised plan should execute flawlessly.

(Thoughts: **My Re-Evaluation of the Rover v12 Plan**
           
           Okay, so the system flagged some configurations as unreachable in the last plan for rover v12. I need to figure out new positions for v12 and v14 to satisfy the mission goals. I'm focusing on v12's initial position at (1.0, -1.75).
           
           **v12's Assignments:**
           
           *   **#o3 (Image v17):** The previous location (-0.7, 1.0) was likely too far. After some thought, I've chosen (0.5, 1.0) because it's within imaging range of v17, and also seems reachable from the starting point. I also had to make sure this location didn't collide with rover `v19`.
           *   **#o0 (Communicate with v9):**  I rejected the previous position (-1.0, -2.0) because of a collision with rover v14 who will be at `v15` for the entire plan.  I've chosen (0.5, -2.0) which is within the communication range and doesn't collide with anything.
           *   **#o5 (Be Above v3):**  I'm switching the location from the previous (2.16, 1.04) to (2.0, 0.0), which I believe is close enough and "above" the target. The specific meaning of "above" seems to allow some distance in the x,y plane.
           
           **Reworked v14's Plan:**
           
           *   I'm keeping `v14` to communicate with `v9` at its home location (which is `v15`).
           *   I also moved v14 to image `v18` from `(-1.5, 0.0)` from `(-1.5, 0.5)` to be "above" `v7`, which is within an acceptable distance.
           
           Finally, I carefully checked that none of the chosen configurations for v12 or v14 cause a collision. All goal conditions should still be met. I am confident that these new configurations will allow the mission to succeed.

(Thoughts: **Refined Plan for Rovers Domain**
           
           Okay, here's my updated plan. I've been through a rigorous process, iteratively analyzing and refining the rovers' movements to achieve the `new-axiom@0()` goal while avoiding the previous issues.  This requires careful consideration of rover configurations, reachability, and collision avoidance in a constrained environment.
           
           *   **Rover `v12`:** Starts at its home configuration, `v13 = (1.0, -1.75)`.  My earlier attempt to use `(0.5, 1.0)` for imaging was problematic due to unreachability. Instead, I'll aim for `#o3` at `(0.2, 1.5)`. This should allow taking an image of objective `v17 (-0.6865, 2.094)`. I've carefully calculated the AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) to ensure this configuration is collision-free with obstacles `v19` and `v20`. For communication, I've selected `#o0` at `(-0.2, -2.0)`. This spot should provide good communication with the lander `v9 (-1.9, -2.0)`. Finally, to sample `v3 (2.16, 1.04)`, I've chosen `#o5` at `(1.8, 0.0)`. All positions are also reachable from the start or previous configurations for rover `v12`. I've double checked the motions instances.
           
           *   **Rover `v14`:** I'm sticking with the previous confirmed and collision-free configurations. `#o3` for imaging `v18` at `(-1.5, 0.0)`, and for communication the location is `v15` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. For being above sample `v7` location is `(-1.5, 0.5)`. I've verified that rover's motion instance is within the allowed list as well.
           
           Here's the refined sequence, assuming the existing communication and image visibility predicates are correctly defined:
           
           **Plan:**
           
           1.  `v12` moves to `#o3` (`0.2, 1.5`).
           2.  `v12` takes image.
           3.  `v12` moves to `#o0` (`-0.2, -2.0`).
           4.  `v12` sends image.
           5.  `v12` moves to `#o5` (`1.8, 0.0`).
           6.  `v12` samples rock.
           7.  `v12` moves to `#o0`.
           8.  `v12` sends analysis.
           9.  `v12` drops the rock.
           10. `v12` moves to `v13`.
           
           11. `v14` moves to `#o3` (imaging position).
           12. `v14` takes image.
           13. `v14` moves to `v15`.
           14. `v14` sends image.
           15. `v14` moves to the soil location, `#o5`
           16. `v14` samples soil.
           17. `v14` moves to `v15`.
           18. `v14` sends analysis.
           19. `v14` drops the sample.
           20. `v14` returns to `v15`.

(Thoughts: **Refined Plan for Rovers in the `rovers` Domain**
           
           Okay, after carefully re-evaluating the plan and addressing the collision errors, I've finalized the coordinate values. My primary goal is still to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, but the focus is on precise positioning for two rovers: `v12` and `v14`. I'm making sure these configurations are collision-free and support the main objectives.
           
           Here's the updated approach:
           
           **Rover `v12`:**
           
           *   **Move `v12` from its starting position `v13=(1.0, -1.75)` to configuration `#o3 = (0.5, 1.5)`.** This is for imaging objective `v17` and is reachable. It accounts for potential collisions with obstacle `v19` by setting the x-coordinate to be > 0.233. This configuration is for imaging objective v17
           *   **Move `v12` to `#o0 = (-0.5, -2.0)`.** This enables communication with the lander `v9`. This location is collision-free and reachable from the starting position. This coordinates is collision free, allowing communication with the lander.
           *   **Move `v12` to `#o5 = (1.5, 1.0)`.** This places `v12` to sample rock `v3`. This configuration, in line with my assumptions, is "above" the sampling target and reachable.
           
           **Rover `v14`:**
           
           *   **Move `v14` from its starting position `v15=(-1.0, -1.75)` to `#o3 = (-1.5, 0.0)`.** (Re-using this configuration since no collisions were found). This is for imaging objective `v18`.
           *   **Move `v14` to `#o0 = (-1.0, -1.75)`.**  (Home config, also reused) This enables communication with the lander `v9`.
           *   **Move `v14` to `#o5 = (-1.5, 0.5)`.** (Re-using this configuration). This enables to sample soil rock `v7`.
           
           The critical aspect remains the *motion* facts. I've re-confirmed that the necessary `motion` predicates exist in the initial state, ensuring that the selected configurations for the rovers are accessible via single or multi-step movements in the model.

Model:     **Refined Plan for Rovers in the `rovers` Domain**
           
           Okay, after carefully re-evaluating the plan and addressing the collision errors, I've finalized the coordinate values. My primary goal is still to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, but the focus is on precise positioning for two rovers: `v12` and `v14`. I'm making sure these configurations are collision-free and support the main objectives.
           
           Here's the updated approach:
           
           **Rover `v12`:**
           
           *   **Move `v12` from its starting position `v13=(1.0, -1.75)` to configuration `#o3 = (0.5, 1.5)`.** This is for imaging objective `v17` and is reachable. It accounts for potential collisions with obstacle `v19` by setting the x-coordinate to be > 0.233. This configuration is for imaging objective v17
           *   **Move `v12` to `#o0 = (-0.5, -2.0)`.** This enables communication with the lander `v9`. This location is collision-free and reachable from the starting position. This coordinates is collision free, allowing communication with the lander.
           *   **Move `v12` to `#o5 = (1.5, 1.0)`.** This places `v12` to sample rock `v3`. This configuration, in line with my assumptions, is "above" the sampling target and reachable.
           
           **Rover `v14`:**
           
           *   **Move `v14` from its starting position `v15=(-1.0, -1.75)` to `#o3 = (-1.5, 0.0)`.** (Re-using this configuration since no collisions were found). This is for imaging objective `v18`.
           *   **Move `v14` to `#o0 = (-1.0, -1.75)`.**  (Home config, also reused) This enables communication with the lander `v9`.
           *   **Move `v14` to `#o5 = (-1.5, 0.5)`.** (Re-using this configuration). This enables to sample soil rock `v7`.
           
           The critical aspect remains the *motion* facts. I've re-confirmed that the necessary `motion` predicates exist in the initial state, ensuring that the selected configurations for the rovers are accessible via single or multi-step movements in the model.
           

User:      Configuration #o3 = (0.5 1.5) for rover v12 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-0.5 -2.0) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o5 = (1.5 1.0) for rover v12 at target v3 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain.**
           
           I've been hitting a wall with reachability errors, particularly for `v12`. It seems I'm consistently choosing configurations that the robot base can't reach, or that result in collisions. I need to be more deliberate and systematic about this.
           
           **Obstacle Awareness is Key:**
           
           I've got two obstacles (`v19` and `v20`) to contend with. The core constraint is keeping the rover's x-coordinate either far left (`< -0.233`) or far right (`> 0.233`) to avoid collision with `v19`. I'll try to find configurations that don't need to cross `v19`.
           
           **Breaking Down the Goal for `v12`:**
           
           1.  **Image `v17`:**  Needs `v12` to be within 2m. I'll target the left side of the playing area, `(-0.5, 1.0)`. This position's easily reachable from `v13=(1.0, -1.75)`, collision-free with respect to `v19`, and the robot is in range of the target.
           2.  **Communicate with `v9`:** Needs `v12` within 4m of `v9`. I'll go with `(-1.0, -2.0)`. This spot is also reachable (from previous spot), and collision-free.
           3.  **Sample above `v3`:**  Needs `v12` near `v3`. I'll set a new goal spot at `(2.0, 1.0)`. This spot is very close to `v3`, but the initial "motion" value might be too far, therefore, I will break down this into a communication sequence.
           -   Move to the `(2.0, 1.0)` spot.
           -   Move to the new `#o0` `(0.5, -1.0)`.
           -   Go back to the `(2.0, 1.0)`
           -   Drop rock.
           -   Repeat `o0` on the way back.
           I'll need to re-evaluate the reachability between `#o3`, `#o0` and `#o5`.
           
           **Addressing the "Not Reachable" Issue:**
           
           The standard `motion` primitive has a maximum distance, which can cause these reachability failures.  The key seems to be breaking down movements into reasonable hops. The "not reachable" error might be with the *continuous* x/y-value, not an explicit path issue.
           
           **Revised `v12` Actions:**
           
           1.  Move from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(-0.5, 1.0)` (`#o3`).  Image.
           2.  Move from `(-0.5, 1.0)` to `(0.5, -1.0)` (`#o0`). Communicate.
           3.  Move from `(0.5, -1.0)` to `(2.0, 1.0)` (`#o5`). Sample.
           4.  Repeat Step 3, then go to `0.5`, then back to `(1.0, -1.75)` for final.
           All distances should now be small.
           
           **Re-evaluating `v14`:**
           
           I also must re-verify the goals for `v14` as well.
           
           1.  **Image `v18`:** `(-1.5, 0.0)`. This keeps `v14` on the left, collision-free, and within range. Reachable from the starting location.
           2.  **Communicate with `v9`:** `(-1.0, -1.75)`.  Within 4m, on the left.
           3.  **Above `v7`:** `(-1.5, 0.5)`. Within range, on the left.
           
           The key is to avoid large single "hops" to minimize the chances of a "not reachable" error.

(Thoughts: **A Revised Path for the Rovers**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with finding a working plan for those rovers, `v12` and `v14`, to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. This means both rovers need to be at specific configurations, `atconf(v12, #conf)`, `atconf(v14, #conf)`, `free` states, and performing their tasks (imaging, sampling, communicating). The key problem has been making sure `v12`'s movements are reachable and collision-free. `v14` seems to be fine, but `v12` has been giving me a headache.
           
           From the initial state, `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`, `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`, and both are initially `free` at the store. Both rovers are equipped with cameras, `v10`. We also have rocks, `v3` and `v7`, which we need to image and sample. And communication with the lander, `v9`, is crucial. Obstacles, a wall `v19` and small object `v20`, need to be avoided. `v12`'s AABB half-width is about 0.183. To be collision-free with wall `v19`, `v12`'s `x` must be less than -0.233 or greater than 0.233.
           
           My previous attempts were failing because of "unreachable" errors. My understanding is that either the distances between steps were too long for the rover's capabilities, or perhaps there was an implicit constraint. Since `motion` facts exist, the path should exist, the magnitudes of the movement must be checked. After re-evaluating the configurations, the plan seems to be the way to go forward.
           
           *   **`v12` Imaging & Sampling Plan:**
               *   **Step 1: Get `v12` in position to image the object `v17` at `(-0.6865, 2.094)`.** I've adjusted this to `(0.4, 1.0)`. Distance from the initial position to here is about 2.81m, which should be reachable. The rover's x-range is now `[0.217, 0.583]` so it avoids `v19` and `v20`. Moreover the visual range is about `1.54m`. So, `v12` can image `v17` without collisions.
               *   **Step 2: Communicate with `v9` at `(-1.9, -2.0)`:** I've adjusted this position to `(-0.8, -2.0)`. This spot is about 1.81m from the last step, and the AABB range from this position avoids the obstacles, and has a distance of 1.1m from `v9`, so the comms should be in order.
               *   **Step 3: Sampling the rock `v3` at `(2.1665, 1.0425)`:** I've adjusted to `(1.5, 0.0)`. This position is within 3.05m from `(-0.8, -2.0)`. Rover's AABB avoids obstacles.
           
           *   **`v14` continues to use its current settings**
           
           I will assume that the plan structure is sound and will implement the revised configuration as follows:
               1.  `v12` to `#o3`: `(0.4, 1.0)`
               2.  `v14` to `#o3`: `(-1.5, 0.0)`
