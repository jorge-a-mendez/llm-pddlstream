(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for a Square-Like Object**
           
           My task is to find 50 stable placements for an object (ID 6) on a square surface. The object is almost a perfect square (sides ~0.095m), and the surface is a square of side 0.27m centered at (0,0). Stability means the object must be fully within the surface.
           
           I've determined that the critical factor is to understand how the object's effective bounding box changes with rotation. Since the object is nearly square, the maximum effective bounding box occurs when the object is rotated by 45 degrees or 135 degrees. However, even the non-rotated AABB has a different extent than the rotated one. The strategy is to select placements using the most conservative bounding box extent, i.e., those that ensure full containment for all stable angles.
           
           My approach is to create a set of stable placements, each represented by a surface index, an angle, and x and y coordinates.
           I'm ensuring that x and y are within a grid, and the object's center must be inside a smaller area than the surface area (to ensure it will fit no matter how I rotate). I've chosen five angles to be: 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3*pi/4, and pi. I need to make sure that for the generated values of `x` and `y`, when the object is rotated for the various angles, it will always be within the defined boundary.
           
           To account for the rotation, I've calculated the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates allowed for different orientations. For instance, at 0 degrees, the object is narrower but taller than at 45 degrees, which has equal height and width.
           
           To get the 50 total placements I need, I've split the points into groups and made sure to generate enough points for each angle such that the totals are 50. I have ensured that the number of `x` and `y` values generated are spaced appropriately for a stable placement on the given angles. I'll test the values to ensure the placement conditions are met, then output them in the required format.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement for Object 5**
           
           Alright, I've got the data. Object 6 is successfully placed, and now I need to figure out where to put object 5. Key constraints: It *must* be on surface 0, it *must* be stable (within the surface bounds), and *crucially*, it *must not* collide with object 6.
           
           Object 6 is nestled in the bottom-left corner of the surface. Its AABB gives me clear boundaries to avoid. The prompt indicates to try different placements if failures accrue, and since object 6 is fixed, I will treat it as a fixed object.
           
           I need to generate a set of possible locations, considering multiple rotations for object 5. For each, I'll calculate the new object's half-extents, `hw_prime_5` and `hh_prime_5`, taking rotation into account.
           
           Then comes the spatial reasoning. My strategy is to **guarantee no overlap** and to prioritize simple constraints. With object 6's position known, I can easily exclude regions. This reduces complexity.
           
           To avoid collision, the new object's AABB cannot overlap object 6's AABB. I've broken this down: `x_center + hw_prime_5 <= min_x_6` OR `x_center - hw_prime_5 >= max_x_6` and `y_center + hh_prime_5 <= min_y_6` OR `y_center - hh_prime_5 >= max_y_6`.
           
           The calculations indicate that a simpler approach is to focus on a placement above object 6 or to the right of object 6, which are simpler constraints. Given object 6's location, I'll focus placements above object 6.
           
           I've decided to generate 50 potential placements across 5 rotations, and since I am treating object 6 as a fixed object to avoid multiple collisions from forming. The 50 locations will have `x` and `y` generated in appropriate ranges: the 20 locations at rotation = 0 will have x, y range, and 10 locations each at rotation = pi, pi/4, 3*pi/4, 5 locations at rotation = pi/2. This will ensure adequate coverage in a non-colliding fashion. This should be sufficient to prevent any overlap.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object 4**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable positions for Object 4 on Surface 0, avoiding collisions with Object 6 and Object 5, which are already in place. Surface 0 is a square, and I have the dimensions of Object 4, which is also close to a square shape.
           
           I've carefully analyzed the properties of Surface 0 and the two existing objects, Object 6 (in the bottom-left corner) and Object 5 (above it). I've calculated the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for both, and I've determined the occupied region in the bottom-left corner of the surface. This creates an "L" shaped free space.
           
           My strategy involves placing Object 4 in the available space, considering the size and shape. I will test common rotation angles (0, π/2, π, π/4, 3π/4) and try placing them in regions around the existing objects.
           
           I begin by calculating the effective dimensions of Object 4 for each rotation. I define the surface bounds and filter based on collision with Object 6 and Object 5, so x coordinates must be beyond `max_x_occupied + hw_prime`, and y coordinates must be beyond `max_y_occupied + hh_prime`. This will help to reduce collisions.
           
           Based on these filtered ranges, I will generate a grid of candidate (x, y) placements for each rotation. After this primary generation, I have implemented a fallback to generate points anywhere on the surface, with a collision filter as the last step.
           
           After completing this approach, I return a list of 50 stable placements, represented as (0, theta, x, y).
