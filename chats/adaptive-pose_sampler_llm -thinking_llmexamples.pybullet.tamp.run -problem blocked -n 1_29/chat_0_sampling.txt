(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for Object ID 5, a 0.07x0.07 object, on Surface 0, which is defined by the points (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0).  Since I'm dealing with axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs), and the object's square-like, a rotation won't change its extents, so I can stick with a theta of 0, which makes things easier. The surface index (surf_idx) will always be 0. Now, I need to figure out the x and y coordinates for 50 placements.
           
           First, I define the usable space on Surface 0.  The min_x is 4.2, max_x is 4.8, min_y is -0.6, and max_y is 0.0. After calculating the bounding extents, the surface is 0.6 units wide and 0.6 units high. Taking into account the object's half-size of 0.035, the usable area for placements is (4.235, 4.765) for x and (-0.565, -0.035) for y. This gives me a valid placement space of 0.53 by 0.53, perfect.
           
           Given the object's size relative to the surface (tiny!), I decided to generate a grid of points within the valid x and y ranges. I tried a few approaches to find a suitable grid spacing. A step of 0.02 leads to too many (729). To simplify and get exactly 50, I will use a grid.
           I set x increments of 0.075 across the 0.53 valid distance, producing 8 x values. Likewise, I create y-values increments also of 0.075 to give the same spacing (approximately).
           This provides an 8x8 grid of 64 points.  Since I only need 50, I can use the first 50 points from my grid.  The 50 placements will look like (surf_idx, theta, x, y), always starting with (0, 0, ...) and using values for x and y within the space I calculated.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Generating Non-Colliding Placements**
           
           Alright, let's get down to business. I've got a new object, ID 10, that needs to be placed on the same surface where object 5 (ID 5) was successfully placed. I have its dimensions (approximately 0.0745 x 0.0745) and its associated half extents.  I've done the preliminary calculations for valid X and Y ranges, which give us the valid bounds to work with on the surface area, and approximated `theta = 0` radians.
           
           The trick now is to make sure object 10 doesn't collide with object 5, which is already placed at `(4.235, -0.565)`. Its AABB is `((4.2, -0.6), (4.27, -0.53))`. I'm calculating all of the AABBs to use for collision detection.
           
           My approach is to create a grid of potential placement coordinates for object 10, then use an effective collision detection check. This collision check involves calculating the overlap between the AABB of object 10 (at each candidate location) and the known AABB of object 5. The basic condition is: `x_overlap > 0` and `y_overlap > 0` imply a collision. I've adjusted the grid step size.
           
           I'm now going to generate my x coordinates by starting from slightly larger x values and y values to avoid the already placed object.
           Then, I iterate through all possible (x, y) combinations. It's a grid of 8 x 8 points with a `step = 0.075`.
           Finally, I filter out any combinations that would result in a collision with object 5. My goal is to find at least 50 valid, non-colliding locations for object 10.
