           Object v7 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.95, -0.342), (-0.817, -0.208)).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.972, 1.799), (2.069, 1.896)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be achieved by satisfying the conjunction of several conditions. Looking at the provided axioms, specifically:
           `Atom atconf(v12, v13)`, `Atom atconf(v14, v15)`, `Atom free(v12, v16)`, `Atom free(v14, v16)`, `Atom receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `Atom receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `Atom receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `Atom type(?stone, v2)`, `Atom receivedanalysis(?stone)`, `Atom type(?soil, v6)`, `Atom receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           From the initial state, we already have:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`
           - `free(v12, v16)`
           - `free(v14, v16)`
           - `type(v1, v2)` (v1 is a stone)
           - `type(v3, v2)` (v3 is a stone)
           - `type(v4, v2)` (v4 is a stone)
           - `type(v5, v6)` (v5 is a soil)
           - `type(v7, v6)` (v7 is a soil)
           - `type(v8, v6)` (v8 is a soil)
           
           So, the remaining conditions to achieve are:
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (for at least one stone)
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (for at least one soil)
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(objective, mode)`, the rover needs to:
           1. Calibrate its camera (`calibrate`).
           2. Take an image (`take_image`).
           3. Send the image (`send_image`).
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(rock)`, the rover needs to:
           1. Sample a rock (`sample_rock`).
           2. Send the analysis (`send_analysis`).
           
           Let's break down the plan:
           
           1.  **Received Images**: We need to receive images for objectives v17, v18, and v19 with mode v11.
               *   Rover v14 is at v15, and v12 is at v13. Both have `imagevisible` predicates to v17, v18, and v19.
               *   The camera v10 is onboard both v12 and v14, and supports mode v11.
               *   We also have `comvisible` predicates for both rovers to the lander v9.
           
               Let's use rover v14 for this.
               *   `calibrate(v14, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)`: Calibrate the camera for v17.
               *   `take_image(v14, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`: Take image of v17.
               *   `send_image(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`: Send image of v17.
               *   `calibrate(v14, #o3, #o4, v18, v10)`: Calibrate the camera for v18. (The camera becomes uncalibrated after taking an image).
               *   `take_image(v14, #o3, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`: Take image of v18.
               *   `send_image(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`: Send image of v18.
               *   `calibrate(v14, #o3, #o4, v19, v10)`: Calibrate the camera for v19.
               *   `take_image(v14, #o3, #o4, v19, v10, v11)`: Take image of v19.
               *   `send_image(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v19, v11)`: Send image of v19.
           
           2.  **Received Analysis**: We need to receive analysis for a stone (v2 type) and a soil (v6 type).
               *   Let's use rover v14 for this. It is at configuration v15. We have `above` predicates for rover v14 to several rocks.
               *   We need to sample a stone and send analysis. Let's pick v3 (a stone).
               *   We need to sample a soil and send analysis. Let's pick v5 (a soil).
           
               *   `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v3, v16)`: Sample stone v3.
               *   `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v3)`: Send analysis of v3.
               *   `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v5, v16)`: Sample soil v5. (v16 is the store, and it needs to be free for the next sample, but we just filled it with v3, so we need to drop v3 first).
               *   `drop_rock(v14, v16)`: Drop v3 from the store to make it free.
               *   `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v5, v16)`: Sample soil v5.
               *   `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v5)`: Send analysis of v5.
           
           All these actions assume that the rays for `imagevisible` and `comvisible` are not blocked. The problem explicitly states `NegatedAtom blocked(?y)` as a precondition for these actions. Since `blocked` is a derived predicate based on `test-cfree-ray-conf-negative`, we assume that if a specific ray (#o1 or #o4) is given in the initial state, it means it's not blocked.
           
           The available actions only include `move` and `drop_rock`. This means the provided list is incomplete or restricted. We need `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. However, the prompt says "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           Given the extremely limited list of allowed action instances:
           `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))`
           `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`
           `((drop_rock v12 v16))`
           `((drop_rock v14 v16))`
           
           And the goal `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates to be true, it seems impossible to achieve the goal with *only* these actions. These actions do not allow for calibration, taking images, sending images, sampling rocks, or sending analyses.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the given set of allowed actions.
           
           The goal is not achievable because the available actions (`move` and `drop_rock`) do not include the necessary actions to achieve `receivedimage` (which requires `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`) or `receivedanalysis` (which requires `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`). These required actions are absent from the provided list of allowed action instances.
