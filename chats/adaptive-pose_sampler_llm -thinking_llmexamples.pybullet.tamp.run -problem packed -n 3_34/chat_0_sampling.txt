(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object 4 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to identify 50 stable placements for object ID 4, a square with side length approximately 0.099 meters, on surface 0, a square surface measuring 0.27 meters on each side.  To ensure stability, the object's rotated bounding box must remain entirely within the surface's bounds.  I've chosen to vary both the object's rotation angle (theta) and its center's (x, y) coordinates.  First, I calculated the rotated bounding box dimensions for a few key angles (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2).  For each angle, I determined the permissible (x, y) ranges by subtracting half the rotated bounding box dimensions from the surface bounds.  Finally, I generated a 4x3 grid of (x,y) points within these valid ranges, covering 12 points for each rotation. I select 10 points to have a diverse set of 50 stable placements. These points, combined with the rotation angle, define the stable placements.

(Thoughts: **Collision-Aware Placement Strategy for Object ID 5**
           
           Okay, I've got this. The previous request was successful, so now I need to place a new square object (ID 5) on the same surface, but here's the kicker: I need to avoid collision with the already-placed object (ID 4) which is positioned at `(-0.085, -0.085)` roughly.
           
           Here's the plan: I first defined a boundary box for the existing object (ID 4) at approximately `[-0.135, -0.036]` for both x and y. Then I will generate a set of potential placements for object ID 5, but I need to ensure they *don't* overlap.
           
           I'll use five different rotation angles to give object 5 diversity. Then, for each angle I will divide the available surface into a 5x5 grid of potential center locations (cx,cy).
           
           For each rotation I need to check the location's collision status. The placement of 4 means the only option to avoid a collision is for the object to be to the right and above object 4. I can check this based on object 4's boundaries by looking for placements where:
           `cx >= x4_max + W5/2 OR cy >= y4_max + H5/2`.
           
           By doing this I know I will generate valid non-overlapping placements.
           If I end up with less than 50 placements I will retry the grid with a smaller spacing, but I'm confident that 50 results will be generated.

(Thoughts: **Scene Understanding and Placement Strategy for Object 6**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. We have a placement problem on Surface 0, which is a square region of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  My task is to find 50 stable placements for Object ID: 6, a square object with sides of `0.08514745291532644`, without colliding with two existing obstacles: Object ID: 4 and Object ID: 5, both already on Surface 0.
           
           Object ID: 4 is located at `(-0.0855, -0.0855)` and Object ID: 5 at `(-0.095, 0.0475)`.  I have all the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) information for those objects, which I will use for collision detection.  Since both existing objects are squares, their AABBs are aligned with the axes.
           
           My primary approach is:
           
           1.  **Rotation and AABB Calculation:**  I'll consider Object 6 at different rotation angles (`0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2`). For each angle, I need to calculate the *effective* AABB dimensions of Object 6 because rotation changes its projected size. The formula is `W_eff = H_eff = s_6 * (|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|)`. I'll use those dimensions to determine the valid placement region.
           2.  **Valid Placement Region:** For each rotation, I'll identify the region within Surface 0 where the center of Object 6 *could* be, while still fully containing Object 6 within the surface.  This involves calculating `cx_min`, `cx_max`, `cy_min`, and `cy_max` which represent the valid center coordinates on the surface.
           3.  **Grid Sampling:** Within the valid placement region for each rotation, I'll create a 5x5 grid of candidate center points `(cx, cy)`. That gives me 25 candidates per rotation.
           4.  **Collision Check:** For each candidate `(cx, cy)` I'll construct the AABB for Object 6 and rigorously check for overlap with the AABBs of Object ID: 4 and Object ID: 5. I will avoid placing Object 6 if any collision is found.
           5.  **Placement Validation:** A potential placement `(cx, cy)` is valid if and only if it *does not* collide with any other existing objects.
           
           I'll iterate through this process until I find 50 stable and non-colliding placements for Object 6, for which I can present the resulting placements in the required format. My main goal is to generate placement candidates that are collision-free.
