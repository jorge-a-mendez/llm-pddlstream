           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Summary of my reasoning:**
           
           I need to find 50 stable placements for a given object on a surface, each defined by `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`.  The surface is a square and the object, while slightly rectangular, is almost square-like.  Since the object's dimensions are almost equal, rotating it doesn't dramatically change its bounding box size.
           
           First, I need to understand the valid `(x, y)` locations for each angle `theta` such that the object stays on the surface. To do this, I calculate the effective half-extents of the object's bounding box, considering its rotation.  These depend on `theta` and are a function of the object's half-width and half-height. Given the object is almost square, I expect the effective extent change little with `theta`. These calculations will allow me to define the valid ranges for `x` and `y` for each `theta`.
           
           I've decided to use 10 different angles between 0 and 2π.  For each angle, I will pick 5 points to cover. For each value of `theta`, I'll generate five `(x, y)` coordinates, forming a representative set of positions (center and four corners) within the surface's boundaries, ensuring the object doesn't extend beyond the surface at each orientation. This systematic approach ensures a good diversity of placements, leading to 50 stable placements.

(Thoughts: **Generating Safe Object Placements**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've got to figure out where to place object ID 4 on surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into object ID 6, which is already smack-dab in the center.
           
           I know object 6's exact dimensions and position: it's at the origin with a certain size. Object 4 is almost square and has known dimensions, too.  My primary constraint is collision avoidance.
           
           I'm thinking, instead of wrestling with rotated bounding boxes, I'll simplify things by using bounding circles to get a good estimate. Also, I know the surface size, so there should be plenty of room for Object 4.
           
           First, I'll calculate the safe placement range for object 4's center *assuming* no object is there and if the new object isn't rotated.  Then, I'll consider collision avoidance by explicitly checking that the rotated bounding box for the object does not collide with the AABB for the pre-placed object (the previous object's AABB is easy, because it is at the center).
           
           I'll define the forbidden zone (a rectangle) around object 6's AABB.  To place object 4, I'll place its center outside that.  Specifically, for a given angle `theta`, I'll determine the valid area for object 4's center.  I'll generate a grid of potential x,y coordinates and filter out the invalid ones that are within the forbidden zone or the ones that collide.
           
           But here's a crucial thing I've realized. The best placements for object 4 are for the angles `0`, `PI/2`, `PI`, and `3PI/2`. For other rotation values, any placement *within* surface bounds will collide with Object 6. This is because the surface is smaller than the combined area of object 4 + object 6.
           
           So, I'll focus on these four angles. I'll take a grid of x,y coordinates on the surface, rotate the box for object 4, and check for collision.

(Thoughts: **Initial Setup and Constraints**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable positions for a new object (ID 5) on surface 0.  I have two other objects already placed: object 6 and object 4, and I have their shapes and positions.  My goal is to place object 5 without any collisions. Object 5 is almost square, and its dimensions are also provided to me.
           
           **Placement Rules and Calculations**
           
           The placement must satisfy these conditions: it must stay on the surface, and it can't bump into object 6 or object 4. I'll need to define some formulas using the coordinates of the object, its dimensions, and the surface.  I'm using the bounding boxes (AABBs) for easy collision detection. I will check for 4 possible object 5 rotations and consider all valid placements. I will generate positions in a grid-like manner to ensure comprehensive coverage of the available space.
           
           **Collision Avoidance**
           
           Surface boundaries establish the acceptable range for the object's center point. I must generate a set of test placements avoiding the collision range of the existing objects.
           *   **Object 6:** Object 6 has its own region. The object 5's possible center must stay out of the "forbidden zone" of object 6.
           *   **Object 4:** Object 4's bounding box defines another region to avoid.
           
           I will iterate through the valid areas and test each point for potential collisions.
           
           **Iterative Search and Refinement**
           
           I'll check a grid of points on the surface, making sure that each point clears the collision checks for both objects 6 and 4.  The generated test points must meet the surface containment criteria, the forbidden area restrictions.  I'm generating points and adding those that work to a results array.  I will search until 50 valid placements are identified.
