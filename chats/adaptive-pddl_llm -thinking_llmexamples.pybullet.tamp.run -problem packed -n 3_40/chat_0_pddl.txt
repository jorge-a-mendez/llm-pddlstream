           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom arm(v6)

           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom bconf(v3)

           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom stackable(v14, v16)
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom atpose(v14, v15)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)

           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)

           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Unachievable Goal: A Constraint-Based Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is clear: I need to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` *on* `v16`.  This translates to ensuring both `supported(object, pose, v16)` and `atpose(object, pose)` are true for each of those objects.  Easy enough, theoretically.
           
           Looking at the initial state, though, these objects are currently all happily perched on `v11`.  So, the logical path is to *move* them from `v11` to `v16`. My understanding of this system tells me "move" requires a `pick` and a `place` action.
           
           Now, here's where the problem arises.  My allowed actions are severely limited.  The only action instance I have at my disposal is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. That doesn't do anything for moving objects. It seems like the only action I'm allowed to do is just... move.
           
           If I were to try to use a `pick` action, for example, I'd need specific predicates to hold: `kin`, `atpose`, `handempty`, and so on, and several negative predicates. The same would be true if I were to use a `place` action. However, none of the necessary instances of `pick` or `place` are available. I'm essentially handcuffed.
           
           Let's double-check the initial state, just to make sure I'm not missing some clever trick. I see that my objects, while *supported* by `v16` (via some *other* poses), are not *at* the right poses.
           
           Unfortunately, `move_base` cannot solve this. It changes the robot's base configuration, but that's irrelevant to object manipulation. The `on` predicate requires I move the objects to be supported by `v16` at a *specific* pose.
           
           Therefore, the only possible conclusion, given these constraints, is that this goal is unachievable with the provided action instances.  I can't manipulate the objects, so I can't reach the target state. It's a dead end, at least with the tools I have.
