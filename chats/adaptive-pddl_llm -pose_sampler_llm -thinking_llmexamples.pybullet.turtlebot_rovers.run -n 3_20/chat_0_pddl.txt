           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable: Configuration Mismatch**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: `new-axiom@0()`. Breaking it down, I need to get some images and analyses sent. Seems straightforward, right? Not quite. My initial assessment is that the state is already mostly satisfying the conditions, except for getting those images and analyses, which is standard.
           
           So, I dig in. To get those images, I need to take them, calibrate the camera, and send them.  The plan is simple: calibrate, take, then send. Similarly, for the analyses, I need to sample rocks and send those results. The actions are: `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. 
           
           Here's where the problem arises: **configuration, or lack thereof**. I have rovers, `v12` and `v14`. They have cameras and can communicate with the lander. The thing is, they are in the *wrong* places. I can see what I need to see, but the rovers are at configuration *v13* and *v15* respectively. My actions, `calibrate`, `take_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` all *require* being at specific configurations: #o3 for images, #o5 for sampling, and #o0 for communication.
           
           Now, I look at the move actions: and I find *no* way to move the rovers! The only "move" actions are essentially no-ops: they move the rover to *itself*. The actions are something like:  `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`. These rovers cannot change their *atconf* and they're permanently fixed in place! I check the predicates `conf` and `atconf`, but there's no way to link or equate `v13` or `v15` with the configurations required to get the job done. I'm *stuck*. I cannot satisfy all the preconditions. The plan is blocked at the outset. My assessment is that the goal is *impossible to achieve* given the available information. My expert intuition suggests a constraint is missing or that a simplification step might make this solvable. For now, however, it's a dead end.
