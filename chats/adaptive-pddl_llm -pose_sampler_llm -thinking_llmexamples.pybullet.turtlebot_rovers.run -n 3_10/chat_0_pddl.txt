           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Unreachable Goal**
           
           My primary objective is to develop a plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()` within the `rovers` domain.  Upon examining the target state defined by `new-axiom@0()`, I immediately recognize that several predicates – `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` – are initially *false* and crucial for goal satisfaction.  
           
           The plan hinges on the ability of the rovers, `v12` and `v14`, to perform actions like imaging, sampling, and communication, which are preconditions for achieving the `received...` predicates. Specifically, I need to focus on *how* to achieve `receivedimage(O, M)` and `receivedanalysis(R)`.  I see that `send_image` achieves the former, and `send_analysis` the latter.
           
           To send an image, I need to get `haveimage(v, o, m)`, which in turn needs the camera to be `calibrated(c, v)`. To get an image of a thing, a rover needs to be `atconf(q)` where `q` allows for both communication and observation.
           
           To send analysis, a rover needs to be `analyzed(v, r)` for a rock and then communication.  This means sampling the rock.  Both actions require the rover to be `atconf(v, q)`.
           
           The trouble becomes evident when I dive into the actions: To capture an image, the rover must be at `#o3`.  To send an image, it needs to be at `#o0`.  For sampling, it needs to be at `#o5`. But the rovers are currently at `v13` and `v15` *and the only actions available do not let the rovers move from those places*. The sole allowed `move` actions simply loop back to the *current* location.
           
           It's clear that the given actions, severely limited by the "not in this list is not allowed" statement, do not provide the necessary mechanisms for the rovers to *reach* the configurations required to perform imaging, communication and sampling. The restricted mobility cripples the ability to reach any goal, as there are no movement actions that satisfy the constraints. The provided mobility in this problem is a "no-op" and makes the whole task impossible.
