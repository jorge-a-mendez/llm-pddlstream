(Thoughts: **Stable Object Placements on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's my thought process on generating 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, dimensions 0.07 x 0.07) on surface 0, defined by the coordinates ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)). I'm treating this like a geometry problem, where I need to fit a bunch of objects within a rectangle, with rotations.
           
           First, I need to define what makes a placement "stable": it has to be entirely within the surface bounds and avoid collisions with anything else (ignoring the "no collisions" constraint for now, since it doesn't apply in this simplified scenario).
           
           The main challenge is considering the object's rotation (theta). The object's AABB dimensions change with theta: `0.07 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This means to avoid calculating new dimensions for every theta, I can figure out the maximum bounding box, and the minimum. This is important: The bounding box is largest at 45 degree multiples, and smallest at 0 degree multiples. I'm going to work with these as rotation steps, to make sure I don't lose useful space.
           
           Now, to actually calculate the space: surface 0 is a rectangle with dimensions 0.6 x 0.6. The object's dimensions are 0.07 x 0.07, and since the object is small, I know I can easily fit 50 with some spacing.
           
           My strategy to generate those 50 placements? I'm going to create a grid within the valid (x, y) space on the surface, and then cycle through different rotation angles, theta. Given that object is square-shaped, I only need to consider rotations between 0 and pi/2. I'm choosing 5 angles: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, and pi/2. For each angle, I will generate an appropriate 3x3 grid of (x,y) points, giving me 9 placements. This gets me to a total of 45 placements. To get the remaining 5 placements, I'll calculate the center point for the region for specific angles.
           
           To calculate these grids: For each theta, I calculate the `extent_rotated` which accounts for the object's dimensions and rotation, then use this to calculate the bounds where the center of the rotated object can be placed. I use these bounds to create a 3x3 grid of (x, y) positions for each angle. The 3x3 grids will mean no objects are touching, as the space between objects will be larger than the object's longest dimension. This will be safe from collision in this scenario.
           
           For the remaining five placements, I will just choose 5 different angles in the range 0 to pi/2, and calculate their center coordinates.

(Thoughts: **Recalibrating Object Placement for Robustness**
           
           My analysis reveals that the previous "not stable" object placements, specifically for object ID 5, failed primarily due to precision issues in calculating and enforcing boundary constraints.  The core problem stems from floating-point arithmetic errors when computing the object's extent (half-width) and subsequently deriving the minimum and maximum *x* and *y* coordinates for the object's center.  Specifically, the system checks whether `center_y - extent >= surf_ly` and `center_y + extent <= surf_uy` and the `y - extent` calculation was not satisfying the former condition because of floating point arithmetic, resulting in placements being rejected.
           
           A square object (0.07 x 0.07 originally, now 0.087 x 0.087 for object ID 10) rotated at an angle necessitates calculating its rotated bounding box to ensure it lies entirely within the surface's bounding box.  The formula `extent = obj_size * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))) / 2`  determines the extent.  However, for non-zero angles (not 0 or π/2), irrational cosine and sine values lead to slight imprecision in this 'extent' calculation.  
           
           Therefore, I've implemented a more conservative approach.  Instead of calculating the center's bounds precisely, I'm introducing a small margin, `delta` (set to 1e-8) to buffer the *x* and *y* coordinates.  This ensures that the center's bounding box is slightly *smaller* than the available surface area, mitigating the risk of the object's AABB extending slightly beyond the defined surface boundary due to rounding errors, or the value of `y_min` being slightly too low.  This adjustment applies to placements in all rotations, not just the previously failing placement at theta=π/8. I will generate positions via:
           - theta = 0, π/8, π/4, 3*π/8, and π/2 for x min/center/max and y min/center/max positions
           - the remaining values of π/16, 3*π/16, 5*π/16, 7*π/16, and 9*π/16 for center positions
           
           This should guarantee that all placements are "fully contained" as requested by the original problem description and fix the issues with floating point precision.
