User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a central vertical wall at x = 0. There are several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the scene, particularly in the corners and some along a horizontal line in the upper half. I will try to find positions for the robot by considering the target point and generating candidates in a circle around it, prioritizing areas that seem less cluttered or further from known obstacles. Since the target is at (0.42 1.48), I will try positions that are relatively close to the target, but also try to vary the angle to avoid potential occlusions. I will prioritize positions on the right side of the central wall (x>0) as the target is on that side.
           
           Positions:
           (0.42 0.48)
           (1.42 1.48)
           (0.42 2.48)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     My previous attempt at (0.42, 0.48) for a target at (2.10, 1.97) failed due to no line of sight. This suggests that the central wall at x=0, or other obstacles between (0.42, 0.48) and (2.10, 1.97), are blocking the view. The target is quite far from the central wall and more towards the positive x and y. I should focus on positions that are also in the positive x and y quadrant to ensure line of sight and avoid the central wall. I'll also try to vary the distance and angle around the target.
           
           Positions:
           (1.10 1.97)
           (2.10 0.97)
           (2.10 2.5)
