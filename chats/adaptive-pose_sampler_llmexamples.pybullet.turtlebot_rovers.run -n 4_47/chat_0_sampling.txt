User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a vertical obstacle (obstacle 5) at x=0, spanning the entire y-range. Other smaller obstacles are scattered throughout the environment. Given the target point, I will try to find positions within the allowed range and maximum distance from the target. I need to avoid placing the robot inside any of the fixed obstacles. The vertical obstacle at x=0 is quite significant, dividing the space into two halves.
           
           For the target point (1.78, -1.91), I will try positions around this point, keeping in mind the max_range of 2.
           
           Positions:
           (1.0 -1.0)
           (1.78 -0.1)
           (0.0 -1.91)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     My previous attempts for the target point (-0.5364, 2.0722) failed.
           - (1.0, -1.0) had no line of sight, which is expected given the x=0 wall. My reasoning about trying positions that are too far from the target's side of the wall was flawed.
           - (1.78, -0.1) collided with obstacle 11. This means I need to be careful with the smaller obstacles as well.
           - (0.0, -1.91) collided with the central wall (obstacle 5) at x=0, which is also expected. I should avoid placing the robot on the central wall itself.
           
           The target point (-0.5364, 2.0722) is in the top-left quadrant, specifically to the left of the x=0 wall and above the y=0 line. I need to find positions within 2 units of this target, on the left side of the x=0 wall, and avoid other obstacles. Given its high y-value, I should also consider positions to its left or slightly below it to avoid occlusions from obstacles above or to its right (near x=0).
           
           Positions:
           (-1.5 1.5)
           (-0.5 0.5)
           (-2.0 2.0)

Model:     My previous attempts for the target point (-0.5364, 2.0722) were:
           - (1.0, -1.0) -- no line of sight (due to the x=0 wall). This confirms that I must stay on the same side of the x=0 wall as the target point.
           - (1.78, -0.1) -- collided with obstacle 11. This was on the wrong side of the x=0 wall anyway.
           - (0.0, -1.91) -- collided with the x=0 wall. This also confirms I should not be on the wall itself.
           
           For the target point (-0.5364, 2.0722), I must stay on the left side of the x=0 wall. The previous proposed positions were (1.5, 1.5), (-0.5, 0.5), and (-2.0, 2.0). Since I don't have feedback on these yet, I will try a similar strategy but with more diverse locations around the target, ensuring they are to the left of x=0.
           The target is at x=-0.5364, y=2.0722. Max distance is 2.
           Obstacles on the left side:
           6: ((-2.4047, -2.34555), (-1.3953, -1.65445))
           8: ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25))
           10: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)) - This is very close to the target point, and the target is likely within this obstacle. I should avoid it.
           12: ((-2.292, 0.4855), (-2.155, 0.6226))
           13: ((-0.3997, 0.449), (-0.2643, 0.5844))
           16: ((-0.5079, 1.5812), (-0.4077, 1.6814)) - This is also very close to the target.
           19: ((-2.0256, 2.1121), (-1.9446, 2.1931))
           20: ((-0.5854, 2.0233), (-0.4874, 2.1213)) - This obstacle (20) contains the target point! The target point is inside obstacle 20. This means I can't place the robot such that it 'sees' the target, as the target is inside an obstacle. I must re-evaluate my approach to placing the robot. I will try to find a place that is within 2 units, but still "outside" the obstacle, if it's possible for the robot to see the target when the target is inside an obstacle. This is usually not the case. I will try to place the robot very close to the obstacle containing the target, assuming the definition of "line of sight" might allow it if the robot is "looking into" the obstacle.
           
           Given that the target point is within obstacle 20 ((-0.5854, 2.0233), (-0.4874, 2.1213)), it is likely that no position will have line of sight to it. However, the problem statement requires me to never give up. I will try to place the robot right outside the boundary of the obstacle, within the max_range of 2.
           
           Target point: (-0.5364, 2.0722).

Model:     I have received feedback on previous attempts. It appears the target point has changed from (-0.5364, 2.0722) to (-1.9850, 2.1526). This is crucial information! My previous reasoning that the target was inside obstacle 20 was based on the old target point.
           
           Let's re-evaluate for the new target point: (-1.9850, 2.1526).
           
           Previous failures for the *new* target point:
           - (-0.6, 2.0722) collided with obstacles 10 and 20. This is understandable as this position is quite far from the target and likely behind some obstacles or inside them.
           - (-0.5364, 2.2) collided with obstacles 10 and 20. Similar to above.
           - (-0.4, 2.0722) collided with obstacles 10 and 20. Similar to above.
           
           All the previous proposed positions were significantly to the right of the *current* target point (-1.9850, 2.1526) and collided with obstacles 10 ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)) and 20 ((-0.5854, 2.0233), (-0.4874, 2.1213)), which are also to the right of the target. This confirms that I need to be on the left side of the x=0 wall, and also to the left of these obstacles to have a clear line of sight to the target.
           
           The target point (-1.9850, 2.1526) is in the top-left quadrant.
           Obstacles to consider near the target:
           8: ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)) - This obstacle is very close to the target point, and the target is actually inside obstacle 8!
           19: ((-2.0256, 2.1121), (-1.9446, 2.1931)) - This obstacle is also very close and might partially overlap with the target region, but obstacle 8 fully contains the target.
           
           Given that the new target point (-1.9850, 2.1526) is inside obstacle 8 (x from -2.25 to -1.75, y from 1.75 to 2.25), it is highly likely that any position will fail the line-of-sight check, as the target is inside a fixed obstacle. However, I must continue to try. I will try to place the robot just outside the boundaries of obstacle 8, within the max_range of 2.
           
           Target point: (-1.9850, 2.1526).
           Obstacle 8: ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)).
           
           Positions:
           (-2.3 2.1526)
           (-1.9850 1.7)
           (-1.7 2.1526)
