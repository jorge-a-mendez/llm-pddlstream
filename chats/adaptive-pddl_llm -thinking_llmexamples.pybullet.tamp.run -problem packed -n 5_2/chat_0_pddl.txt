           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v20)
               Atom on(v12, v20)
               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Action Constraints**
           
           My task is to devise a plan to move several objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) onto v20. The current state has all these objects on v11, and the axiom for "on" requires an object to be supported at a certain pose. To achieve this, I need to place each object at a pose such that it's supported by v20. The facts I was given clearly indicate that the necessary supporting relationships (e.g., supported(v8, #o2, v20)) hold, and so placing these objects onto the right pose `#o2` is the route to success.
           
           However, the only allowed action instance is (move_base v3 v3 #o0). This means I'm severely constrained. To alter the *atpose* predicates of the target objects I would need to use `pick` and `place` actions; however, *no* instances of these actions are provided. This is a severe problem because it means I cannot change any object's position with the available action instances.  I've double-checked that `on` requires an `atpose` change, and that can't be achieved with the only allowed action.
           
           Therefore, since the only action I'm allowed to use doesn't alter any of the *atpose* facts, there is no way to achieve the goal state. The problem is unsolvable because the `pick` and `place` actions required to move the objects have been explicitly excluded. I am blocked.
