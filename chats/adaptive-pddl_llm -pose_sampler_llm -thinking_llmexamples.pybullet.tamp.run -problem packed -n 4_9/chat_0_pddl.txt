(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for a Square Object**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out how to place this square object 50 times on a surface in a stable manner.  The surface is a square, and I know its dimensions.  The object is also a square, and I know its side length.  The key is that for a stable placement, the object *must* be fully within the surface.
           
           First, I need to consider the object's rotation.  Since it's a square, when I rotate it, the effective bounding box (AABB) changes.  I need to calculate the *maximum* effective size of this bounding box at any rotation.  I've figured out that the maximum occurs at a 45-degree angle (pi/4), when the effective side length is the object's side length times the square root of 2.  I calculated this maximum effective side length.
           
           Now, to generate placements, I'll rotate the object at a variety of angles. For each angle, I need to ensure the object's AABB fits within the surface. So, I need to calculate the maximum permissible x and y coordinates.
           
           I've determined a strategy to generate 50 placements. I'll pick 5 different angles, specifically, `0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2`. This range of angles gives a good view of the rotations and captures the extremes.
           
           For each of those angles, I'll calculate the new, smaller size of the effective bounding box. Then, I'll generate a grid of positions, making sure the object's bounding box is fully contained within the surface.
           
           I'm creating a 5x2 grid for each angle: 5 different x positions, and 2 y positions, which gives 10 placements per angle. And since I have 5 angles, that gets me a total of 50 placements, which is what I need.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Avoiding Collisions**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with placing a new object (ID 4) on a surface where another object (ID 5) already sits. Crucially, these objects can't collide. My primary focus is to ensure the stable placement of the new object on the surface while adhering to this no-collision rule.
           
           First, I assessed the existing object's placement and characteristics. It's a square (side length `s5 = 0.09839817860424582`) placed at `(-0.08580091069787709, -0.08580091069787709)` with no rotation (`theta = 0`). I can define the AABB of this object, which takes a bottom left region of `[(-0.135, -0.135), (-0.0366, -0.0366)]`.
           
           Now, for the new object, which is also a square (side length `s4 = 0.0969697640567122`), I need to determine safe and diverse placements. The surface boundary is defined, and my task is to calculate valid positions. I know the general AABB principles, including the effects of rotation on the object's extents.
           
           My approach will be to generate a series of potential placements (x, y, theta) and ensure they do not overlap with object 5's AABB. My collision strategy will be primarily based on ensuring the object's AABB avoids overlapping object 5's area, which is in the bottom-left of the available surface space.
           
           Here's the plan: I'll consider 5 angles (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2). For each, I calculate the half extents of the object's effective AABB, and the valid x and y range on the surface, accounting for the effect of rotation. I will calculate `x_min_collision_free` and `y_min_collision_free` based on the coordinates of obj 5. I will then pick points, ensuring that the final placement satisfies the constraint where the object lies outside the collision area of obj 5. I will choose points in the right, the top right, and the top section, away from the bottom-left part of the surface.
           
           For each rotation I'll follow this general strategy:
           
           1.  **Calculate Effective Extent:** Calculate the half-extent of the object's effective AABB based on its rotation.
           2.  **Determine Valid Range:** Determine the valid x and y ranges on the surface, considering the object's size and rotation.
           3.  **Check for Collision:** Determine x and y values that satisfy the collision criteria.
           4.  **Generate Positions**: I'll generate 10 positions for each angle. The plan is to create different and reasonable points using a combination of corners, centers, and other reasonable locations.
           
           I'll focus on getting a diverse set of coordinates that ensures a reasonable and varied spread, avoiding any overlaps with object 5, thereby guaranteeing the stable, no-collision requirement of the task. For each angle, the placement strategy will involve computing valid bounding boxes while taking into consideration the collision criteria, by ensuring that the object can be located right and above the current object, and other valid and diverse points that meet criteria.

(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements for a New Object**
           
           Okay, so I've got to figure out where to put this new object, ID 6, on surface 0 without it crashing into objects 4 and 5, which are already in place. My constraints are that object 6 must fit within the bounds of the surface, and that it can't collide with the existing objects, no matter how it's rotated.
           
           I've got the surface size, and I've worked out the bounding boxes (AABBs) for objects 4 and 5. This is easy enough math; based on size and placement, I can calculate their AABBs' min and max x and y values.
           
           I'm thinking, since object 6 is square, I can calculate its effective half-extent for any rotation using the formula `(size/2) * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. I'll need to use this to determine its boundary based on angle and for AABB checking.
           
           Now, I've got a limited valid region where I can safely place this new object. I need to make sure I do not place any point within object 5 (bottom-left) and object 4 (top-right). 
           
           I've visualized this surface, and I see the usable space; it is essentially the central area. The rest of the surface is mostly off-limits to me. I've also worked out the equations for collision with the previous objects using a basic AABB system; the object's rectangle can't overlap, so the equations are simple inequality checks. 
           
           I'm going to take the angle of the object into account as well for increased variability. After considering several angles to place the object, I've got a system. 
           *   Calculate the range of x and y for each valid angle.
           *   Check ranges for all the angles against the existing objects.
           
           I will generate points inside valid areas. So, for each angle I will divide the object surface into two parts: top-left and bottom-right. Within these, I will create equally spaced points, making sure I hit the center and corners of available rectangles.
           
           I'm confident I can generate these 50 stable placements, ensuring that I maintain enough spacing from the existing objects.
