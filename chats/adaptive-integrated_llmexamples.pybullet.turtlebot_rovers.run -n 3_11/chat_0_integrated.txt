           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks us to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom derived from several conditions. Let's break down the `new-axiom@0()` conditions:
           
           `new-axiom@0()` is true if:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover `v12` is at configuration `v13`. This is true in the initial state.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover `v14` is at configuration `v15`. This is true in the initial state.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: Store `v16` on rover `v12` is free. This is true in the initial state.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: Store `v16` on rover `v14` is free. This is true in the initial state.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: Image of objective `v17` in mode `v11` has been received.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Image of objective `v18` in mode `v11` has been received.
           7. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: Image of objective `v19` in mode `v11` has been received.
           8. `type(?stone, v2)`: Some object is of type `v2` (stone).
           9. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: Analysis of that stone has been received.
           10. `type(?soil, v6)`: Some object is of type `v6` (soil).
           11. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: Analysis of that soil has been received.
           
           From the initial state, we already satisfy conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4. The main task is to satisfy conditions 5, 6, 7, 9, and 11.
           
           Let's look at the available actions:
           *   `move`: This action changes the rover's configuration. We have `move v12 v13 #o2 v13` and `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`. These actions would move the rovers from their current configurations to the same configurations, effectively doing nothing but changing the continuous parameter `#o2`. Since the initial state already has the rovers at their desired configurations, we don't need to move them.
           *   `take_image`: Requires `imagevisible`, `onboard`, `supports`, `atconf`, `calibrated`, and not `blocked`. It produces `haveimage` and makes the camera uncalibrated.
           *   `calibrate`: Requires `imagevisible`, `onboard`, `atconf`, and not `blocked`. It produces `calibrated`.
           *   `send_image`: Requires `comvisible`, `objective`, `mode`, `haveimage`, `atconf`, and not `blocked`. It produces `receivedimage`.
           *   `sample_rock`: Requires `above`, `store`, `atconf`, and `free`. It produces `full` and `analyzed`.
           *   `send_analysis`: Requires `comvisible`, `rock`, `analyzed`, `atconf`, and not `blocked`. It produces `receivedanalysis`.
           *   `drop_rock`: Requires `rover`, `store`, and `full`. It produces `free`.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, and `receivedimage(v19, v11)`:
           We need to `take_image` for each objective and then `send_image`.
           Both `v12` and `v14` have `v10` onboard which supports `v11`.
           
           Let's check `take_image` prerequisites for `v17`, `v18`, `v19`:
           *   `imagevisible`:
               *   `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)`
               *   `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`
               *   `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`
               *   `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`
               *   `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)`
               *   `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`
           *   `onboard`: `onboard(v10, v12)` and `onboard(v10, v14)` are true.
           *   `supports`: `supports(v10, v11)` is true.
           *   `atconf`: `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are true. We also need to be at `#o3` if we use those `imagevisible` predicates. Since the initial state gives `conf(v12, #o3)` and `conf(v14, #o3)`, and if `#o3` is `v13` or `v15` respectively, we don't need to move. However, `v13` and `v15` are specific configurations, and `#o3` is a continuous parameter. The problem statement says to prefer existing configurations. Let's assume `#o3` represents a valid configuration for `v12` and `v14` respectively, and it can be reached from `v13` and `v15`. For simplicity and given the available moves, let's assume `v13` and `v15` are the configurations from which images can be taken if `#o3` is suitable for them.
           *   `calibrated`: Not true initially for `v10`. We need to `calibrate`.
           *   `not blocked`: Not initially true, but we assume it's possible to find clear rays.
           
           So, for images:
           1.  Calibrate `v10` on `v12` for `v17` (or `v18`, `v19`).
           2.  Take image of `v17` using `v12`.
           3.  Send image of `v17` using `v12`.
           Repeat for `v18` and `v19`.
           
           Alternatively, we can calibrate `v10` on `v14` and take images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19` with `v14`. Since both rovers have `onboard(v10, rover_name)`, either can be used. Let's use `v12` for all image tasks.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`:
           We need to `sample_rock` for a rock of type `v2` (stone) and `v6` (soil), and then `send_analysis`.
           *   Objects of type `v2`: `v1`, `v3`, `v4`.
           *   Objects of type `v6`: `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           
           Let's check `sample_rock` prerequisites:
           *   `above`:
               *   `above(v12, #o5, v1)` (type `v2`)
               *   `above(v12, #o5, v3)` (type `v2`)
               *   `above(v12, #o5, v7)` (type `v6`)
               *   `above(v12, #o5, v5)` (type `v6`)
               *   `above(v12, #o5, v8)` (type `v6`)
               *   `above(v12, #o5, v4)` (type `v2`)
               *   `above(v14, #o5, v1)` (type `v2`)
               *   `above(v14, #o5, v3)` (type `v2`)
               *   `above(v14, #o5, v7)` (type `v6`)
               *   `above(v14, #o5, v5)` (type `v6`)
               *   `above(v14, #o5, v8)` (type `v6`)
               *   `above(v14, #o5, v4)` (type `v2`)
           *   `store`: `store(v16)` is true.
           *   `atconf`: We need to be at `#o5`. Similar to `#o3`, we assume `#o5` is a valid configuration for `v12` or `v14` respectively, and reachable from `v13` or `v15`.
           *   `free`: `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true.
           
           We need to sample one stone and one soil. Let's use `v1` (stone, type `v2`) and `v7` (soil, type `v6`) both with `v12` if possible. Rover `v12` can be `above(#o5)` for both.
           
           Plan steps:
           
           1.  **Image acquisition and sending (for v17, v18, v19):**
               *   For `v12` to take images, it must be `calibrated`.
               *   We will use `v12` to take images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
               *   Rover `v12` is at `v13`. We have `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, objective)` for all three objectives. Let's assume the continuous parameter `#o3` represents the current configuration `v13` or a configuration reachable from `v13` that allows imaging. For this problem, we'll assume `v13` is a valid configuration to satisfy the imagevisible and comvisible predicates that reference `#o3` and `#o0` respectively, since no moves are specified to reach `#o3` or `#o0`.
               *   Calibrate `v10` on `v12` for `v17` from `v13`.
               *   Take image of `v17`.
               *   Send image of `v17`.
               *   Calibrate `v10` on `v12` for `v18` from `v13`. (The camera becomes uncalibrated after taking an image)
               *   Take image of `v18`.
               *   Send image of `v18`.
               *   Calibrate `v10` on `v12` for `v19` from `v13`.
               *   Take image of `v19`.
               *   Send image of `v19`.
           
           2.  **Sample and analyze rocks (for type v2 and v6):**
               *   Rover `v12` is at `v13`. We need to be `above(#o5)` to sample. Let's assume the continuous parameter `#o5` represents the current configuration `v13` or a configuration reachable from `v13` that allows sampling.
               *   Sample `v1` (rock of type `v2`) using `v12` from `#o5`. This makes `v12`'s store `v16` full and `v1` analyzed by `v12`.
               *   Send analysis of `v1` using `v12` from `v13` to `v9`. Assume `v13` is also good for `comvisible(#o0, #o1, v9)`.
               *   Since the store is full, `v12` cannot sample another rock. We can either drop `v1` (which is not in the goal) or use `v14`. Let's use `v14` for the second sample.
               *   Sample `v7` (rock of type `v6`) using `v14` from `#o5`. This makes `v14`'s store `v16` full and `v7` analyzed by `v14`.
               *   Send analysis of `v7` using `v14` from `v15` to `v9`. Assume `v15` is also good for `comvisible(#o0, #o1, v9)`.
           
           It's important to use the configurations `v13` and `v15` as the current `atconf` positions for `v12` and `v14` respectively, and that the continuous parameters `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are compatible or represent these locations with appropriate rays. Since the problem statement states, "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration", this means if we use `#o0` or `#o3`, we need to provide a value. If we use `#o5` for `above` predicate, we also need to provide a value since `conf(v12, #o5)` and `conf(v14, #o5)` are in the initial state.
           
           Let's consolidate the use of configurations and rays.
           For `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, target)`: need to define `#o3` and `#o4`.
           For `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`: need to define `#o0` and `#o1`.
           For `above(v12, #o5, rock)`: need to define `#o5`.
           
           Let's assign the current configurations `v13` and `v15` to the continuous parameters for simplicity if they enable the required predicates. If not, we'll need new configurations.
           However, since the initial state has `conf(v12, #o5)`, `conf(v12, #o3)`, `conf(v12, #o0)` and similarly for `v14`, it implies these `#` objects are distinct configurations that need to be defined. Also, for `imagevisible` and `comvisible`, the `ray` parameter (`#o1` and `#o4`) also needs to be defined.
           
           Let's assume:
           *   `#o3` is a configuration for imaging that is different from `v13` and `v15`.
           *   `#o0` is a configuration for communication that is different from `v13` and `v15`.
           *   `#o5` is a configuration for sampling that is different from `v13` and `v15`.
           
           The current allowed actions do not include `move` to a different `#` configuration, only to the same `v13` or `v15`. This means we are restricted to executing actions only from `v13` and `v15`. However, the `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` predicates in the initial state use `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` as configurations, and the `atconf` is only `v13` and `v15`. This is a crucial inconsistency in how the problem is specified, as it implies we should be at `#o0`, `#o3`, or `#o5` to use these predicates, but we are only at `v13` or `v15`, and cannot move to `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`.
           
           Given the wording "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan" and the provided `move` actions which only return to the same configuration, the only possible interpretation is that the initial `atconf` values `v13` and `v15` are implicitly equivalent to `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` for their respective rovers when used in the predicates from the initial state. This allows the plan to proceed without explicit `move` actions to these `#` configurations.
           
           Let's assume `v13` and `#o3` (for `v12`) are the same, and `v13` and `#o0` (for `v12`) are the same, and `v13` and `#o5` (for `v12`) are the same. Similarly for `v14` with `v15`.
           
           Plan:
           
           For Images (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`):
           1.  Calibrate `v10` on `v12` for `v17` at `v13` (using ray `#o4`).
           2.  Take image of `v17` with `v12` at `v13` (using ray `#o4`).
           3.  Send image of `v17` with `v12` at `v13` (using ray `#o1` to `v9`).
           4.  Calibrate `v10` on `v12` for `v18` at `v13` (using ray `#o4`).
           5.  Take image of `v18` with `v12` at `v13` (using ray `#o4`).
           6.  Send image of `v18` with `v12` at `v13` (using ray `#o1` to `v9`).
           7.  Calibrate `v10` on `v12` for `v19` at `v13` (using ray `#o4`).
           8.  Take image of `v19` with `v12` at `v13` (using ray `#o4`).
           9.  Send image of `v19` with `v12` at `v13` (using ray `#o1` to `v9`).
           
           For Analysis (`v1` (type v2) and `v7` (type v6)):
           10. Sample `v1` (type `v2`) with `v12` at `v13` into `v16`.
           11. Send analysis of `v1` with `v12` at `v13` (using ray `#o1` to `v9`).
           12. Sample `v7` (type `v6`) with `v14` at `v15` into `v16`.
           13. Send analysis of `v7` with `v14` at `v15` (using ray `#o1` to `v9`).
           
           We need to provide continuous values for `#o0`, `#o1`, `#o3`, `#o4`, `#o5`.
           Since `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`, these must be defined.
           `ray(#o1)` and `ray(#o4)` are in the initial state, so they must be defined.
           
           Let's define the continuous parameters assuming they are derived from the rovers' current positions to the targets.
           
           *   `v12` (at `v13`: (1.0, -1.75, 3.142)) imaging `v19` ((-0.615, 1.793), (-0.521, 1.887)). Target approx (-0.568, 1.84). Distance approx sqrt((1 - (-0.568))^2 + (-1.75 - 1.84)^2) = sqrt(1.568^2 + (-3.59)^2) = sqrt(2.458 + 12.888) = sqrt(15.346) approx 3.91. This is too far for `imagevisible` (max 2).
           
           This reveals a problem with the problem statement's `imagevisible` predicates. If the distances between `v12` (at `v13`) and `v17`, `v18`, `v19` are all greater than 2, then `take_image` is impossible from `v13`.
           Let's check `v12` (at `v13`: (1.0, -1.75)) and `v17` ((1.915, 2.074), (1.992, 2.151)). Target approx (1.95, 2.11). Distance approx sqrt((1-1.95)^2 + (-1.75-2.11)^2) = sqrt((-0.95)^2 + (-3.86)^2) = sqrt(0.9025 + 14.90) = sqrt(15.8) approx 3.97. Also too far.
           `v12` (at `v13`: (1.0, -1.75)) and `v18` ((0.561, 1.879), (0.66, 1.977)). Target approx (0.61, 1.93). Distance approx sqrt((1-0.61)^2 + (-1.75-1.93)^2) = sqrt(0.39^2 + (-3.68)^2) = sqrt(0.1521 + 13.54) = sqrt(13.69) approx 3.7. Also too far.
           
           Similarly for `v14` (at `v15`: (-1.0, -1.75)).
           `v14` and `v17`: Distance approx sqrt((-1-1.95)^2 + (-1.75-2.11)^2) = sqrt((-2.95)^2 + (-3.86)^2) = sqrt(8.7 + 14.9) = sqrt(23.6) approx 4.8. Too far.
           `v14` and `v18`: Distance approx sqrt((-1-0.61)^2 + (-1.75-1.93)^2) = sqrt((-1.61)^2 + (-3.68)^2) = sqrt(2.59 + 13.54) = sqrt(16.13) approx 4.0. Too far.
           `v14` and `v19`: Distance approx sqrt((-1-(-0.568))^2 + (-1.75-1.84)^2) = sqrt((-0.432)^2 + (-3.59)^2) = sqrt(0.186 + 12.888) = sqrt(13.074) approx 3.6. Too far.
           
           Given the distance constraint for `imagevisible` (max 2), none of the `imagevisible` predicates can be true from `v13` or `v15` to any of `v17`, `v18`, `v19` based on the provided object locations. This means taking images is impossible from the initial `atconf` positions.
           
           The problem statement explicitly says: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state... then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration such that ... occlusion-free line-of-sight to the target object ... The maximum distance from the rover to the target is 2 for `imagevisible`".
           
           This implies that `#o3` is a different configuration for `v12` (and `v14`) from `v13` (and `v15`) that satisfies the distance and line-of-sight constraints. Since the only available `move` actions don't allow moving to `#o3`, the plan cannot use `take_image` or `calibrate`. Therefore, the `receivedimage` goals are impossible to achieve with the given actions and initial state.
           
           The axiom `new-axiom@0()` requires `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`. Since these cannot be achieved, the overall goal is unachievable.
           
           If I must assume that `v13` (or `v15`) IS `#o3` (or `#o0`, `#o5`), then the `imagevisible` predicates are incorrectly specified to be true in the initial state given the geometry. However, I must strictly follow the provided initial state. The problem implies that these `imagevisible` predicates *are* true, and the robot *can* use them. The only way this can be true is if the `#o3` configuration is separate from `v13` and `v15`, and the robot is implicitly able to be at `#o3` for the image-related actions. However, the available `move` actions do not permit moving to `#o3`.
           
           Let's re-read the instruction carefully: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration". This implies that if `#o3` or `#o0` are used, a value must be provided for them *as configurations*. But the initial state explicitly says `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`. There's no `atconf` for `#o3` or `#o0` or `#o5`.
           
           If I am forced to assume that the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` and `above` predicates are true from the *current* `atconf` locations (`v13` and `v15`) despite the geometric mismatch (distances), then I would proceed with the plan above. However, the instruction to provide continuous values for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` contradicts this, as these would then need to be new configurations that are reachable.
           
           Let's consider the statement: "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is *false*." This means `atconf(v12, #o3)` is false, and `atconf(v12, #o0)` is false, and `atconf(v12, #o5)` is false. Since these are false, `calibrate`, `take_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_image`, `send_analysis` cannot be executed as their preconditions require `atconf(v, q)` where `q` is `#o3`, `#o0`, or `#o5` respectively. This is because the problem explicitly states `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)` meaning `q = #o3`.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable. The only way to reach it would be if the `atconf` of the rovers were explicitly set to `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5` in the initial state, or if `move` actions to these configurations were available. Neither is the case.
           
           I will proceed under the interpretation that the explicitly stated `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are the only `atconf` predicates that are true. And since the `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` predicates in the initial state use `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` as their second arguments (the configuration), and there's no way to reach these configurations, then the actions depending on these predicates cannot be executed.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
