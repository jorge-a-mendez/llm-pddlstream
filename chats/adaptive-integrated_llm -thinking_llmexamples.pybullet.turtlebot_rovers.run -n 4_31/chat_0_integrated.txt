           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Configuration Constraints**
           
           My primary objective is to devise a plan to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` goal, which necessitates acquiring images and analyses of specific objects. The challenge lies in the structure of this axiom, which depends on conditions like `receivedimage(?o, ?m)` and `receivedanalysis(?o)`. Achieving these requires a series of actions—specifically `send_image` and `send_analysis`—that are intricately dependent on the rover's configuration.
           
           Delving into the specifics, I observed that `send_image` and `send_analysis` have the shared precondition `atconf(?v, ?q)`, which demands that a rover (`?v`) be at a specific configuration (`?q`) for these actions to take effect. The problem description explicitly states the initial rover configurations: rover `v12` is at `v13` and rover `v14` is at `v15`. However, the required configurations for imaging and communication—as indicated by the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates—are `#o3` and `#o0`, respectively.
           
           Now, here's where the problem becomes intractable: the permitted `move` actions are limited to no-ops, like `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`. This implies that the rovers are fixed and cannot transition to the necessary configurations (`#o3`, `#o0`, `#o5` for sampling). Therefore, the precondition `atconf(?v, ?q)` cannot be met for any action that requires a configuration different from the initial.
           
           Because I cannot satisfy the preconditions required to image or sample with the given action instances, this makes the objective, `new-axiom@0()`, impossible to achieve.
