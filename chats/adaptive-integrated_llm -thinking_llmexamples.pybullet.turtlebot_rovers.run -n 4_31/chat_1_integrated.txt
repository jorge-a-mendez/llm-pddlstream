           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, and I see that means making sure several conditions are met, primarily involving images and analyses. My goal is to orchestrate a plan that ensures these conditions are true at the end, while also ensuring the final configuration of the rover aligns with initial conditions specified.
           
           1.  **Initial Assessment**: I note that some of the initial conditions for `new-axiom@0()` are already satisfied. No problem there.
           
           2.  **Image Acquisition Phase**: The first substantial step revolves around the `receivedimage` predicates. To make this happen, I'll use the rover `v12` to grab images of four objectives: `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`. The plan is to move `v12` to a series of configurations, each optimized for seeing a specific objective and within range to take an image, then sending those images.
           
               *   For each objective (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`), I'll need to move `v12` to the correct configuration (#o3), which is a continuous parameter that I'll need to calculate, then have it calibrate, take the image and then move to the next.
           
               *   Specifically, that means for each objective:
                   *   `move(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)` (the initial to the first image configuration)
                   *   `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, <objective>, v10)`
                   *   `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, <objective>, v10, v11)`
                   *   `move(v12, #o3, #o2, #o3)` (move from previous target configuration to next)
           
               *   To send them, I'll have the rover travel to `#o0` (the sending configuration), then send each of the images to the lander using send\_image.
                   *   `move(v12, #o3, #o2, #o0)`
                   *   `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v<objective>, v11)` (send the image from #o0)
           
               *   For the images I will be computing a single `#o3`, however since `#o3` is stated in the prompt, there can be multiple values. As such, the approach for each objective is slightly different.
           
           3.  **Analysis and Sampling**: Next, I'll switch gears and address the `receivedanalysis` requirements. The core of this involves `sample_rock`, `drop_rock`, and `send_analysis`. Again, using rover `v12`, I'll move it to `conf` locations where sampling is possible, collect samples, drop the samples, send them.
           
               *   Move to rock sample location, then sample rock.
                   *   `move(v12, #o0, #o2, #o5)`
                   *   `sample_rock(v12, #o5, <rock>, v16)`
                   *   `drop_rock(v12, v16)` (must do this after sampling because v16 becomes "full")
                   *   `move(v12, #o5, #o2, #o0)` (now we can send samples)
               *   Send analyses.
                   *   `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, <rock>)`
           
           4.  **Finalizing Rover Position**: To ensure the axiom is fully satisfied, `atconf(v12, v13)` needs to be true at the plan's end. So, I will move the rover back to the configuration it started from.
           
               *   To satisfy this need, I must have the rover travel from the final sent location, `#o0`, to `v13`.
                   *   `move(v12, #o0, #o2, v13)`
           
           **Detailed Steps**
           The complete sequence is as follows:
           
           1.  Move Rover to image capture configuration for each of the objects.
               *   `move(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)` (to v17)
               *   `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)`
               *   `take_image(v12,
)

Model:     **Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, and I see that means making sure several conditions are met, primarily involving images and analyses. My goal is to orchestrate a plan that ensures these conditions are true at the end, while also ensuring the final configuration of the rover aligns with initial conditions specified.
           
           1.  **Initial Assessment**: I note that some of the initial conditions for `new-axiom@0()` are already satisfied. No problem there.
           
           2.  **Image Acquisition Phase**: The first substantial step revolves around the `receivedimage` predicates. To make this happen, I'll use the rover `v12` to grab images of four objectives: `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`. The plan is to move `v12` to a series of configurations, each optimized for seeing a specific objective and within range to take an image, then sending those images.
           
               *   For each objective (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`), I'll need to move `v12` to the correct configuration (#o3), which is a continuous parameter that I'll need to calculate, then have it calibrate, take the image and then move to the next.
           
               *   Specifically, that means for each objective:
                   *   `move(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)` (the initial to the first image configuration)
                   *   `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, <objective>, v10)`
                   *   `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, <objective>, v10, v11)`
                   *   `move(v12, #o3, #o2, #o3)` (move from previous target configuration to next)
           
               *   To send them, I'll have the rover travel to `#o0` (the sending configuration), then send each of the images to the lander using send\_image.
                   *   `move(v12, #o3, #o2, #o0)`
                   *   `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v<objective>, v11)` (send the image from #o0)
           
               *   For the images I will be computing a single `#o3`, however since `#o3` is stated in the prompt, there can be multiple values. As such, the approach for each objective is slightly different.
           
           3.  **Analysis and Sampling**: Next, I'll switch gears and address the `receivedanalysis` requirements. The core of this involves `sample_rock`, `drop_rock`, and `send_analysis`. Again, using rover `v12`, I'll move it to `conf` locations where sampling is possible, collect samples, drop the samples, send them.
           
               *   Move to rock sample location, then sample rock.
                   *   `move(v12, #o0, #o2, #o5)`
                   *   `sample_rock(v12, #o5, <rock>, v16)`
                   *   `drop_rock(v12, v16)` (must do this after sampling because v16 becomes "full")
                   *   `move(v12, #o5, #o2, #o0)` (now we can send samples)
               *   Send analyses.
                   *   `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, <rock>)`
           
           4.  **Finalizing Rover Position**: To ensure the axiom is fully satisfied, `atconf(v12, v13)` needs to be true at the plan's end. So, I will move the rover back to the configuration it started from.
           
               *   To satisfy this need, I must have the rover travel from the final sent location, `#o0`, to `v13`.
                   *   `move(v12, #o0, #o2, v13)`
           
           **Detailed Steps**
           The complete sequence is as follows:
           
           1.  Move Rover to image capture configuration for each of the objects.
               *   `move(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)` (to v17)
               *   `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)`
               *   `take_image(v12,

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Plan: Obstacles, Communication, and Imaging**
           
           Okay, so the last plan didn't work because some configurations were unreachable or caused collisions.  I need to rethink how to view objectives and communicate with the lander, especially considering the obstacle `v21` that's causing trouble.
           
           Let's start by re-examining the rovers, objectives, and their configurations.
           
           *   `v12` is currently at `v13 (1.0, -1.75)` and `v14` is at `v15 (-1.0, -1.75)`.  
           
           *   The objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`) are for imaging, and the lander (`v9`) is for communication.
           
           *   The major problem is the obstacle `v21`, a thin wall at x = 0.
           
           *   The previous plan had issues because the configurations I chose caused collisions, so I have to re-evaluate them. Specifically, the configurations for `imagevisible` (`#o3`) and `comvisible` (`#o0`) need to be reconsidered.
           
           **Revised Strategy: Specific Configurations for Each Rover-Target Pair**
           
           I've decided that a more precise approach is needed. I'm going to create *unique* configurations for each (rover, target) pair.  Since the prompt says I must provide a *different continuous value* for each pair, I'll use those constraints.  For example, instead of a general `#o3`, I'll use `#o3_v12_v17`, `#o3_v14_v18`, and so on.
           
           Here's the new plan:
           
           **Rover v12 (at v13):**
           1.  **Image v17 & v20:** Move to a specific *reachable, collision-free* position close to them. Then, calibrate, take the image and send the image.
           2.  **Sample rocks v3 and v7:** Go to a sampling configuration.
           3.  **Communicate:** Move to a config to send data for imaging and sampling to the lander. Return to `v13`.
           
           **Rover v14 (at v15):**
           1.  **Image v18 & v19:** Similar to above, move to a position near to take an image of each. Then, calibrate, take the image and send the image.
           2.  **Sample rocks v1, v4, v5 and v8:** Go to sampling config and sample all 4 rocks.
           3.  **Communicate:** Move to a config to send data for imaging and sampling to the lander. Then return to `v15`.
           
           **Configuration Details:**
           
           *   **Comm for `comvisible`:** Because `v12` would need to cross the obstacle to communicate with the lander, and the plan failed due to that blocked ray, I'm making `v14` (at `(-1.0, -1.75)`) the communicator. Therefore, the communication point (#o0) must be achievable for `v14`. Given this, `(1.0, -1.0)` is a possible position (reachable and not blocked).
           
           *   **Image Locations (`#o3`):**
               *   For `v17` and `v20` (right of `v21`), the config will be `(X_coord, 0.5)` for `v12`. I need to choose the appropriate x-coord for imaging `v17` and `v20` separately.
           
               *   For `v18` and `v19` (left of `v21`), config will be `(X_coord, 0.5)` for `v14`. I need to choose the appropriate x-coord for imaging `v18` and `v19` separately.
           
           **Specific Coordinates**
           
           *   **For the Communication (#o0)**: I will pick the starting configurations. The communication happens with `v14` in position `v15` for communication. I could place it at that location.
           *   **Imaging Locations:**
               *   *For `v17` at (0.3805, 2.038)*. Use (0.5, 1.0)
               *   *For `v20` at (2.0685, 1.9825)*. Use (1.5, 1.0)
               *   *For `v18` at (-2.0755,

(Thoughts: **A Detailed Re-evaluation of the Reachability and Configuration Requirements**
           
           Based on the feedback and my understanding of the problem's nuances, I've had to re-evaluate the reachability of configurations, particularly for `v12` and `v14`, and how they interact with named configurations like `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`. The issue is not just about the starting poses (1.0, -1.75 and -1.0, -1.75) but ensuring the rovers can *reach* the necessary locations while avoiding collisions, particularly with the wall `v21` at X=0.
           
           Initially, I focused on the idea that the problem was trying to provide an arbitrary goal coordinate that must be reached, but it seems that the problem is meant to be interpreted that *named* coordinates must be explicitly and correctly defined with coordinates, while ensuring *paths* are feasible. Since my previous attempt had an error about unreachable base configurations, I must now redefine the configurations associated with `#o0` and `#o3` and ensure they are *reachable* based on the available `motion` predicates.
           
           I've carefully re-examined the initial state's `motion` predicates for `v12` and `v14`, identifying the allowed transitions between configurations. This means that if `v12` starts at `v13`, it can move to `#o0`, `#o3`, or `#o5` *directly* (and back). Similarly, for `v14` (starting at `v15`), the same named configurations exist. Thus, I *must* define continuous values for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` so that they work for the initial state predicate and are reachable via `motion`.
           
           The core challenge is the interpretation of the instruction: "If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair". This suggests that even though the PDDL uses `#o3` (and `#o0`) consistently, *I* can define a distinct physical configuration for each rover-target combination to *ensure* reachability and collision-free communication.
           
           Given this interpretation, I've divided the tasks:
           
           *   **v12 (starts at (1.0, -1.75)):** Will handle image targets `v17` and `v20` (X>0), sample rocks `v3` and `v7`, and comm with `v9`.
               *   I'll assign individual `#o3` coordinates for each image target, e.g., `#o3_v12_v17` and `#o3_v12_v20`. The move actions will be `(move v12 v13 #o2 #o3)`, while providing the coordinates for the different `#o3` instances.
               *   For the `#o0` (comms), I'll set `(-0.5, -1.0)`, reachable and collision-free.
           *   **v14 (starts at (-1.0, -1.75)):** Will handle image targets `v18` and `v19` (X<0), sample rocks `v1, v4, v5`, and `v8`, and communicate with `v9`.
               *   Similarly, I'll use separate `#o3` coordinates for imaging.
               *   The `#o0` for comms can be the starting location `v15` or a nearby reachable location.
           
           Therefore, for each *unique* rover-target pairing that depends on a named configuration, I will ensure its configuration can be reached by the rover, then calculate a valid and collision free configuration and provide these configuration values for the corresponding predicates.

           Configuration #o0 = (-0.5 -1.0) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachability**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. We're tasked with achieving a complex goal, `new-axiom@0()`, involving image acquisition, rock analysis, and communication, while respecting constraints of reachability, collision avoidance, and occlusion-free line-of-sight. The previous attempt failed, specifically due to reachability issues involving rover `v12`.
           
           My initial assessment is focused on the core issues: reachability and collision avoidance, especially regarding obstacle `v21` (a wall at x=0). I've mapped out the key objects, their properties, and their initial states. Crucially, rovers start at opposite sides of this wall, which immediately introduces a significant constraint.
           
           **The Crucial Constraint: Obstacle v21**
           
           The scene is effectively divided by the wall `v21`. Rover `v12` is on the positive X side, and `v14` is on the negative X side. Based on the previous error, I know that `v12` can't reach the lander `v9` across the wall, rendering it unable to *directly* communicate.
           
           The predicates seem to allow `comvisible` with the lander *potentially*, but the robot's base can't move through the wall.
           
           This creates an immediate problem: since the goal requires both rovers to *communicate* with the lander, and the lander is on the negative X side, at least one rover (probably `v14`) needs to get the data for the objects `v17, v20, v3, v7` (on the positive X side), but it can't cross `v21`. And if `v12` gets them, it can't communicate them to the lander.
           
           **Unsolvable Conflict**
           
           Essentially, the placement of objects, combined with the presence of `v21`, creates an irreconcilable conflict. The rover on one side cannot reach the resources on the other side. This results in the overall goal becoming unreachable. This is due to a fundamental limitation caused by a wall, and the initial configurations and required objective locations. No motion will solve this issue, given the current PDDL definition of the domain.
