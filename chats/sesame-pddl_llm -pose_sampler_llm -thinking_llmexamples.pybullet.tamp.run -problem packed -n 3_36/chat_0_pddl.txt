(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning for Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 4) of side 0.09176 units on a square surface.  A stable placement means the object is *fully* contained within the surface, and placements are described as (surface_index, rotation_angle, x_center, y_center).
           
           The initial complexity comes from considering how rotating the square affects its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB). The problem states the geometry is based on AABB dimensions which, typically, indicates dimensions *when the object is not rotated*.  This is crucial for the interpretation. If interpreted correctly, then it is important to take the tightest possible valid placement.
           
           Since a square's AABB grows when rotated by angles other than multiples of 90 degrees.  Therefore, to guarantee stability for *any* rotation, I must consider the worst-case scenario.  The largest effective AABB happens at a 45-degree angle. With side `S` of the square, the maximum AABB dimensions are `S * sqrt(2)`.
           
           I calculated the minimum and maximum *x* and *y* values for the object's center such that the maximum AABB can always be contained within the given surface. These bounds are centered at (0,0) and the maximum offset. To be extra sure, I calculate the new, tighter constraints, which give me a smaller allowable region for the center. With that in mind, I need to generate 50 valid placements.
           
           To generate diverse placements, I can vary x, y, and rotation. I decided on seven evenly spaced x and y values within these bounds, resulting in a 7x7 grid. I'm using an initial rotation of 0 for these. To have even more diversity, I'll add a 50th placement with `theta=pi/4`, at the center. By using `theta = 0` and this 7x7 grid of x,y locations within the safe bound, I can ensure that even with any *other* value of `theta`, the object will still be fully contained within the surface. The result will be a list of 50 tuples (surface_idx, theta, x, y) that represent the valid placements. The output is a list of tuples, ready for use.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Summary**
           
           Okay, here's my plan for placing Object 5, ensuring it avoids collision with the existing Object 4. First, I need to account for Object 4's presence, which I'll treat as a fixed obstacle. Object 4 is located at `(-0.07005, -0.07005)` with its size.
           
           I've determined the valid surface area is defined by coordinates of `[-0.065, 0.065] x [-0.065, 0.065]`. My primary goal is to generate 50 distinct placements, so I'm starting by analyzing the collision geometry for Object 5. Because Object 5 is square-shaped, I can calculate its half width and height easily, which I'll denote as `half_s_5`. For the sake of simplicity and initial placement, I will first calculate the safe region without rotation. However, for precise avoidance, I am calculating based on any degree of rotation, which I know is more restrictive.
           
           Based on the surface size and position of Object 4, I can determine the restricted area which I need to block for a collision.
           
           Since I am considering `theta = 0` for my first 49 attempts, I need to adjust the collision zone accordingly to find a safe region. Based on the position of Object 4, I've determined that the safe area is limited.
           
           I've decided to employ a grid-based approach. I'll create a 10x10 grid across the valid surface and then filter out points within the restricted area. In this case, 7 points are removed in each row and column, so in total I remove 49 points. I'll make the spacing fine enough to get 50 different points.
           
           Finally, I will generate the 49 points with `theta = 0` and add the final point at a safe, rotated position, calculated and accounted for the size of object 5, which gives the 50 placements.

(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new task: place object 6, a little square, 50 times on surface 0 without crashing into the existing objects, objects 4 and 5. Here's the plan I'm working through:
           
           1.  **Understand the playing field:** I need to figure out the "safe zone" on surface 0.  I know the surface's dimensions and the maximum size object 6 can become when it's rotated.  This lets me calculate the boundaries where object 6's center must stay.  I've calculated that the center of object 6 must stay within -0.067 to 0.067 on both x and y.
           
           2.  **Obstacle Analysis:** I've got the placement info (position and dimensions) of objects 4 and 5. These are the no-go zones! I need to know how far out from their centers I need to stay.
           
           3.  **Rotation Considerations:** I'll allow object 6 to be placed at 0 or pi/4, so I need to account for both orientations. I figured out the effective bounding box dimensions for both angles to make sure I don't run into problems.
           
           4.  **Collision Detection:**  I calculated the "no-go zones" for object 6, based on it's current orientation, and where the centers of objects 4 and 5 are. These calculations change if I rotate object 6.
           
           5.  **Placement Generation:**  My approach is to create a grid of potential placement points over the area of the safe zone on surface 0. Each grid point is evaluated for collision (0 or pi/4). I am using a 15x15 grid, a far more accurate representation than previous grid attempts. I calculated that by using this grid, it should contain a sufficient number of safe placement points. I will have a much smaller chance of overlap with objects 4 and 5.
           
           6.  **The Goal:**  I am confident that with these placements, I can achieve the request for a non-overlapping object 6.
