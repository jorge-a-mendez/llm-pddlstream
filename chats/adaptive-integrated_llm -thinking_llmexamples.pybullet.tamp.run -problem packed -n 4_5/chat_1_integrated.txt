User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.239, 0.449, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.974, 0.225).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.054, 0.298), (0.142, 0.387)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.116, -0.597), (-0.022, -0.503)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.154, 0.437), (0.252, 0.536)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.098, 0.343, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.162, 0.987).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.285, 0.402), (-0.192, 0.496)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.069, -0.55, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.97, -0.243).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.203, 0.487, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.419, 0.908).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning the Robot's Task: Placing Objects on a Surface**
           
           My objective is clear: I need to devise a strategy to position objects v8, v12, v14, and v16 onto surface v18. Initially, these objects are resting on surface v11. The robot, immobilized at base configuration v3, is equipped with two arms, v4 and v6, which are both initially empty and at specific configurations. My challenge is to leverage the robot's capabilities to achieve this task, especially given the constraint that the robot's base cannot move.
           
           To begin, I will pick up each object individually from v11 and place it onto v18. This involves using the robot's arm v4, since the available planning instances utilize v4. For each object, I'll execute a `pick` action followed by a `place` action. These actions are kinematically feasible, with preconditions related to hand emptiness, base configuration, and negation of unsafe approach/trajectory predicates.
           
           The available kinematic predicates (`kin`) are provided for `pick` and `place` actions using arm `v4`. These predicates specify the required robot configuration and object interactions. Notably, the base configuration (#o3) for kin must be v3 because the robot is fixed. I am also informed of the "grasps" (#o1) which are consistent across all four objects, as are the trajectories (#o4).
           
           The critical part is determining the placement on v18. As v18's continuous values (AABB) are provided, I must adhere to the placement requirements. The four objects will occupy specific, collision-free locations on v18.
           
           To achieve a solution I've chosen poses for each object's placement on v18:
           
           *   For `v8`, I've selected `(-0.0675, 0.0675, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           *   For `v12`, I've selected `(0.0675, 0.0675, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           *   For `v14`, I've selected `(-0.0675, -0.0675, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           *   For `v16`, I've selected `(0.0675, -0.0675, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           
           With the placements defined, I'm ready to construct the final plan, consisting of a sequence of `pick` and `place` actions to manipulate each object onto its designated spot on v18.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Impossible Task**
           
           Okay, so I've looked at the provided plan, and it's a non-starter. The rejection makes perfect sense. The only action I'm allowed to use is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This means I'm essentially stuck in place! I can't actually *do* anything meaningful with this single command.
           
           The problem, as I see it, is that I need to manipulate objects. Specifically, I need to get several objects to be *on* a new surface, `v18`. But the starting state clearly shows these objects are currently supported by `v11`.  And to change their support, I *must* pick them up and place them down. That's fundamental to this type of manipulation. Without the ability to use `pick` and `place`, I'm completely hamstrung.
           
           Since I can only "move" to the exact same position, it's immediately obvious that the goal, `on(v8, v18), on(v12, v18), on(v14, v18), on(v16, v18)`, is completely unreachable given these constraints. It's a fundamental mismatch between the allowed actions and the required operations. It seems like the only logical conclusion is that this is simply an impossible task with the provided action set.
