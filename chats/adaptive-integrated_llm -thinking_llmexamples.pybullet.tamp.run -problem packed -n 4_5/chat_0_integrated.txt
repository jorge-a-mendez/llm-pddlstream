User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.239, 0.449, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.974, 0.225).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.054, 0.298), (0.142, 0.387)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.116, -0.597), (-0.022, -0.503)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.154, 0.437), (0.252, 0.536)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.098, 0.343, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.162, 0.987).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.285, 0.402), (-0.192, 0.496)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.069, -0.55, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.97, -0.243).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.203, 0.487, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.419, 0.908).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning for Goal Unreachability**
           
           I am faced with a challenging task: to devise a plan to move four objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) from their current positions on surface v11 to a new surface, v18. The problem statement defines that I must place each object on the designated surface. I have reviewed the initial state, which details the current positions of the objects, all supported by v11. The goal, therefore, is to manipulate these supported relationships such that each object is supported by v18.
           
           Initially, I looked for valid poses on v18. The supported facts, specifically, supported(vX, #o2, v18), suggested potential placement locations using #o2.  I noted the constraint related to the '#o' poses. Since all objects must be placed on v18, each object needs a distinct position. 
           
           The available tools are the robot's arms (v4 and v6), its base (v3), and a `move_base` action instance.  The arms are handempty, and the robot's base is atbconf(v3). A crucial constraint emerged from the list of valid action instances. I'm limited to a single `move_base` action that essentially does nothing, since the start and end configurations are identical. This immediately raises a red flag. The domain requires `pick` and `place` actions to modify the environment. Given the single `move_base` instance, I reasoned that I could move the robot to be in the "same" position to pick and place. There are no relevant kin facts, and that would prevent a pick/place.
           
           I meticulously examined the object poses within v11's AABB and the requirements for the robot's base and arm configurations to execute any pick or place. There are no valid pick and place actions available. All the objects are at poses contained within v11. The key realization is that the problem statement explicitly forbids the use of any action instances *not* provided in the list. This restriction is critical.
           
           The list of permissible action instances *only* includes a `move_base` action with no effect. No `pick` or `place` instances are in the provided list. The rules are clear: I cannot use any actions beyond those listed. As picking and placing are prohibited, I conclude the goal to move the objects from v11 to v18 is unattainable. I confirmed this conclusion by re-evaluating the necessary steps. Since moving the objects onto v18 requires pick and place actions, the given initial conditions coupled with the constraints on permissible actions render the target unachievable.
