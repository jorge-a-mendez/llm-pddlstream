User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.249, 0.186), (-0.175, 0.259)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.208, -0.302), (0.293, -0.217)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.28, -0.546), (-0.206, -0.472)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.212, 0.222, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.028).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.149, 0.241), (0.221, 0.312)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.25, -0.26, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.993, -0.122).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.243, -0.509, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, -0.028).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.185, 0.277, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, -0.01).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Reachability of the Goal: A Deep Dive into the Problem**
           
           Okay, so the task at hand is to devise a plan to get objects v8, v12, v14, and v16 onto object v18. Initially, they're all resting on v11. The core of this, from my understanding of the *pr2-tamp* domain, revolves around picking and placing. We need a sequence of *pick* and *place* actions for each object to move them.
           
           Looking at the setup, each object's initial state is clearly defined: its pose, and its supporting object (v11). The goal state is equally straightforward: to have these same objects resting on v18.
           
           Now, here's where things get tricky. We're given a strict rule: only actions explicitly provided in a list of "valid action instances" can be used.  I see a `move_base` action, but crucially, no `pick` or `place` instances are listed.
           
           To achieve the goal, my *instinct* is to map out the *pick-and-place* sequence: identify a grasp and trajectory for picking, then finding a suitable target pose on v18 and executing a place. This would entail reasoning about collision-free poses for objects on v18. However, because `pick` and `place` actions aren't listed in the available action instances, I am *stuck*. I am prevented from implementing the very actions necessary to transform this initial state into the desired goal state. No amount of creative thinking can overcome the constraint here.
           
           The only action that I *can* use, the `move_base`, does *nothing*. So, no trajectory planning and no *move*.
           
           In sum, given these constraints, the problem is *unsolvable*.
