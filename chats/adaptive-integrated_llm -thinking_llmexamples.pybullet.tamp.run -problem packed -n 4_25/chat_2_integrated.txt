User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.249, 0.186), (-0.175, 0.259)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.208, -0.302), (0.293, -0.217)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.28, -0.546), (-0.206, -0.472)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.212, 0.222, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.028).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.149, 0.241), (0.221, 0.312)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.25, -0.26, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.993, -0.122).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.243, -0.509, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, -0.028).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.185, 0.277, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, -0.01).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **The Orchestration of Objects: A Detailed Plan**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is clear: get those four objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) onto surface v18. I'm starting with a clean slate: robot at configuration v3, arm v4 empty, and the objects scattered about, each resting on the larger table v11.
           
           The crucial concept here is `on(object, surface)`. I know that means the objects have to be supported by, and placed at, a suitable position on v18. The problem statement made it explicitly clear that when multiple objects are to be placed at the "same" symbolic location (symbolized with "#"), I have to provide different continuous pose values.
           
           Here's how I envision achieving this:
           
           1.  **Move & Position:** I'll begin by moving my base from the starting position v3 to a configuration #o3 that's closer to the action. It is chosen to be at (-0.5, 0.0, 0.0) so I can reach the table easily.
           
           2.  **Pick & Place (Repeated):**
               *   Pick up object v8 from its initial position v9. The pick happens with the grasp #o1 for arm v4, given the robot is in configuration #o3 and follows trajectory #o4. Then, I'll place v8 onto its assigned location on v18 (represented by the pose #o2).
               *   I'll repeat the same picking and placing actions for v12, v14, and v16, each time targeting its own designated spot on the plate.
           
           Regarding the continuous values for the poses, I have to ensure the objects can be arranged neatly, safely, and without collision. I will also have to ensure that all these movements and places are within the table's area and reach. Given that objects v8, v12, v14, and v16 are relatively small, I am using a 2x2 grid approach with `0.05` spacing. These are the values I have come up with for the four poses that will be at `#o2`:
           
           *   For v8: (-0.05, 0.05, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   For v12: (0.05, 0.05, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   For v14: (-0.05, -0.05, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   For v16: (0.05, -0.05, 0.781, 0.0)
           
           With this plan, each object is picked up by the arm (v4), moved to the base location (#o3), and placed on the plate with the defined poses. The entire process consists of one base move and four pick-and-place cycles. The cost of this plan is 8.5 units.
