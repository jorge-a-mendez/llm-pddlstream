User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.234, -0.23, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.263, 0.965).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.093, 0.416), (0.002, 0.511)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.204, 0.171), (0.277, 0.244)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.045, 0.463, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.97, -0.242).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.282, -0.278), (-0.186, -0.182)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.24, 0.207, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.692, 0.722).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Relocation**
           
           My primary goal is to orchestrate the movement of three objects – v8, v12, and v14 – from their current resting positions onto the surface v16 using a two-armed robot, v4 and v6. Both arms are currently handempty, and the robot base is fixed at v3, a constraint that will significantly influence my planning.
           
           The initial states are as follows: v8 at pose v9, v12 at pose v13, and v14 at pose v15, all supported by v11.  My objective is to have each of these objects placed *on* the surface v16, which requires each of them to be at a specific pose and supported by v16. I must work with the existing predicates `kin` that define possible pick and place actions.  The parameters here are key; I've got continuous variables to juggle: move_base trajectory (#o0), grasps (#o1), poses (#o2), base configurations (#o3), and arm trajectories (#o4).
           
           The structure of my plan is fairly straightforward; it's a sequence of picks and places. First, I'll pick an object, and then I'll place it on v16 at a determined pose. Since no base movement is possible, base configuration (#o3) is fixed at v3. Regarding the placement, I'll define unique pose values on v16 for each object, even though all objects will be on v16. These continuous values will represent the locations to which the objects will be placed; I'll handle that later.
           
           I'll start with v8, pick it from v9 and place it at a non-overlapping position. Then, I’ll repeat this procedure for v12 and v14.
           
           My grasp on the parameters and how they fit into the constraints are as follows: The only action available for moving the base is (move_base v3 v3 #o0), which means the base is static; thus, I set the base configuration parameter (#o3) at v3. Grasping of an object is done with grasp parameter #o1. For poses, v16 has an associated continuous value. The robot's initial arm is empty and its position remains static.  I've opted to proceed in the following order: v8 first, then v12, and finally v14.
           
           For the picking and placement operation for v8, I need to pick it up from pose v9, and place it at a newly defined continuous pose `#o2_v8`, supported by the target surface, v16. The goal is `on(v8, v16)`, which will mean `atpose(v8, p_v8_v16)` and `supported(v8, p_v8_v16, v16)`.  The placement for the remaining objects follows a similar logic.
           
           The crucial element is finding the right poses, ensuring they're collision-free and that the objects don't overlap. Considering the objects' and target surface's extents, as long as I can calculate safe positions to accommodate those sizes, then the strategy is set. Given the surface and object AABBs, I'll set some coordinate values to place each.
           
           The plan's execution, in short, amounts to a succession of picking up objects and putting them down elsewhere. Each pick/place will be one of these actions using the `kin` predicates. The total cost, considering a cost of 1 for each pick and each place, comes to 6.  My plan is simple, robust, and directly addresses the problem's criteria, meeting the constraints and working efficiently.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Understanding the Limitations: Why the Goal is Unreachable**
           
           Okay, so I've looked over the provided plan and the constraints, and it's pretty clear what the issue is. The previous attempt used `pick` and `place` actions, but those simply aren't in the list of what's *allowed*. All we have is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`, which translates to, "The robot can move its base from vertex `v3` to vertex `v3` using trajectory `#o0`."  Frankly, that's it. No picking, no placing, no interaction with objects whatsoever.
           
           The goal, as I understand it, is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`. Since our *only* tool is moving the base *from a place to the same place*, and given there's nothing in the initial conditions that satisfies the goal, it's just not possible. We're effectively trying to build a bridge with one brick. The fundamental actions necessary for this task are missing. I'll need to articulate this clearly, explaining that the plan is unexecutable because the provided action set is insufficient to achieve the desired state.
