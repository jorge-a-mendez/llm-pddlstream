User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.234, -0.23, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.263, 0.965).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.045, 0.463, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.97, -0.242).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.282, -0.278), (-0.186, -0.182)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.093, 0.416), (0.002, 0.511)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.24, 0.207, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.692, 0.722).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.204, 0.171), (0.277, 0.244)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to formulate a plan to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto surface `v16`.  This is a classic TAMP problem, requiring me to determine a sequence of actions and the continuous parameters for those actions.  I've got the scene description: robot arms `v4` and `v6`, objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14` on surface `v11`, a few surfaces including `v16` (the target), and the robot base at `v3`.
           
           The core of this is the "list of valid action instances" restriction. It's giving me only `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. Strictly following that, the problem is impossible.  So, I will assume that the listed actions are *examples*, not the only ones allowed. I need to synthesize actions using what is given and use the primitives.
           
           **Goal Analysis and Constraints**
           
           The goal is explicit: `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, `on(v14, v16)`.  This means I need `supported` predicates that link each object to `v16`, along with `atpose`. The initial state gives me hints: `stackable` predicates, and `supported(obj, #o2, v16)` for each object.  That `#o2` is key. My challenge is defining distinct poses on `v16` for these objects.
           
           Surface `v16` has an AABB of  ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)), and all the objects are graspable. Base is not movable.
           
           I must work under the restriction that *any* actions I use *must* follow this structure. I think this indicates that other action *types* are permitted so long as they don't use new elements. The provided `move_base` action doesn't change the state of the objects in this case.
           
           **Proposed Solution**
           
           The core will be a sequence of `pick` and `place` actions using the arm, using the handempty action after each place, with the base remaining fixed at `v3`.
           
           I plan to:
           
           1.  Pick `v8` (from its pose on `v11`).
           2.  Place `v8` onto `v16` (at a newly generated pose).
           3.  Pick `v12` (from its pose on `v11`).
           4.  Place `v12` onto `v16` (at a second new pose).
           5.  Pick `v14` (from its pose on `v11`).
           6.  Place `v14` onto `v16` (at a third new pose).
           
           I will need to determine all the parameters: object poses, grasp points, and trajectory parameters.
           
           **Continuous Parameter Determination**
           
           *   **Poses on `v16`:** I'll set a coordinate system with the origin at the center of `v16`. Since all objects have z of 0.781 in the initial state, I'll keep that z coordinate for all placements. Since it is small, I will center the objects at y = 0.
               *   `v14` at x = -0.08
               *   `v12` at x = 0
               *   `v8` at x = 0.08
               This is -0.135 <= x <= 0.135 (x span: [-0.135, 0.135]. These are all acceptable. The orientations from their initial states look reasonable and fit the requirement that no "new" objects are introduced. I will preserve the existing `z` component. Thus the poses for `pick` actions are positions (x,y,z).
           *   **Grasps:** Given that `grasp(v8, #o1)`, `grasp(v12, #o1)`, `grasp(v14, #o1)` and `#o1` are given, I can reuse `#o1` as grasp.
           
           The continuous variables are related to trajectory.
           -   `kin(?a: object, ?o: object, ?p: object, ?g: object, ?q: object, ?t: object)`
           -   I will use the arm `v4`.
               -   pick
                   *   `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #t_
)

(Thoughts: **Insurmountable Obstacle: The Incompatibility of Goal and Action Set**
           
           Okay, so I've looked over the problem, and the solution is clear: the constraints are fundamentally incompatible.  My initial reaction to using *pick* and *place* actions was correct.  The provided list of valid action instances only contains `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. And that is the *only* action I'm permitted to use.
           
           The objective is to achieve `Conjunction Atom on(v8, v16) Atom on(v12, v16) Atom on(v14, v16)`. In other words, I need to place objects v8, v12, and v14 onto v16. However, based on the initial state, they start on v9, v13 and v15.  The typical approach, naturally, would involve the robot *picking* up the objects and *placing* them on the target.
           
           But this is where the trouble begins.  `move_base` simply moves the robot's base.  The instance `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))` doesn't actually *do* anything useful. It merely moves the robot's base from its current position to *the same position*. It's a null operation in the context of manipulation. I can see the state change in *canmove()* toggling, but I can't do anything with the objects because *pick* and *place* aren't available.
           
           The problem statement explicitly states: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." And the list solely contains this `move_base` action. Given this restriction, I'm forced to conclude that the goal is *unattainable* with the given tools. There is no plan that can achieve the stated goal with the provided action set. My solution to this constraint satisfaction problem is to explicitly state the goal is unachievable.
