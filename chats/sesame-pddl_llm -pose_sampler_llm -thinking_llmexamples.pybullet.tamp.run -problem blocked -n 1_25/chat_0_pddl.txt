(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for a Square Object**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. I need to find 50 stable placements for a square object (7cm x 7cm) on surface 0, which is an AABB defined by ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  A stable placement means the object is completely inside this AABB.  Since the object is square, rotation doesn't change its bounding box, so I'll set theta to 0 for all placements to keep things simple.
           
           First, I need to calculate the allowable range for the object's center (x, y).  The object's half-extents (hx, hy) are both 3.5cm (0.035m).  This gives me the following constraints:
           
           *   4.2 + 0.035 <= x <= 4.8 - 0.035  => 4.235 <= x <= 4.765
           *   -0.6 + 0.035 <= y <= 0.0 - 0.035 => -0.565 <= y <= -0.035
           
           I'll create a grid of evenly spaced points within these ranges.  To generate 50 placements, I'll use an 8x7 grid.
           
           *   **x-step:** (4.765 - 4.235) / 7 = 0.53 / 7  ≈ 0.0757
           *   **y-step:** (-0.035 - (-0.565)) / 6 = 0.53 / 6  ≈ 0.0883
           
           I will generate x values as follows:
           `x_values = [4.235 + i * (0.53 / 7) for i in range(8)]`
           And y values:
           `y_values = [-0.565 + j * (0.53 / 6) for j in range(7)]`
           
           I'll then combine these to get my placements.  Since this is the first request, I don't have to worry about collision avoidance yet. I will set the surface index to `0` and theta to `0`.  I'll just pick the first 50 placements of the 56 generated.  The output will be in the form of `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Object Placement Summary**
           
           Alright, here's the game plan for placing those fifty stable objects (ID 10) without any unwanted encounters, bearing in mind my expertise in geometric constraints. My primary consideration is preventing collisions with the previously placed object (ID 5).
           
           First, I assessed the object's square-like dimensions (approximately 0.070265 x 0.070265) to determine how they'd behave in a rotation-free setup (theta = 0). This simplifies matters, allowing me to focus on x and y coordinates. The initial valid surface (surface ID 0) provides the area for placement, defining the permissible bounds:
           
           *   **x:** 4.235132650219789 to 4.764867349780211
           *   **y:** -0.5648673497802105 to -0.035132650219789505
           
           The critical challenge is the presence of existing object locations for ID 5. Ten successful placements of ID 5 mean these are fixed obstacles. Each ID 5 object has coordinates and corresponding axis-aligned bounding boxes (OBBs) that must not intersect with the new object's placements.
           
           To ensure non-overlapping, I've divided the x and y dimensions into smaller, distinct grid-like regions within the valid bounds.
           * x_step =  (0.764867349780211 - 4.235132650219789) / 7 = 0.529734699560422 / 7
           * y_step = ( -0.035132650219789505 - (-0.5648673497802105) ) / 6 = 0.529734699560421 / 6
           
           The approach that was first explored would almost certainly result in collisions with ID 5. Thus, I've had to adapt and devise a collision-free placement strategy.
           * I need a placement strategy for object 10 that avoids collisions with the known positions of object 5.
           * I have identified the x-coordinate boundaries for the locations of object 5, and I will place object 10 outside of them.
           
           Here's my refined approach to solve this:
           The current approach involves identifying the minimum x for the new object.
             1. Calculate half extents, half_extent_x = 0.070265 / 2 = 0.0351325
             2. x_start = 4.345714285714285
             3. y_start = -0.5648673497802105
             4. The object will be placed in a grid, from this origin.
           
           By analyzing the x-coordinates, and avoiding the x-region of the obstacles, I can ensure placement.
           I will generate 50 stable object locations without any collisions!
