(Thoughts: **Reasoning through the Plan to Satisfy new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which, based on the provided axioms, translates to ensuring that object `?green` (which is `v12` in this instance) is `on(v12, v18)` and its type `type(v12, v17)` is known. The type condition is already satisfied in the initial state, so my focus is on achieving `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           To make `on(v12, v18)` true, I need to ensure `supported(v12, #p1, v18)` and `atpose(v12, #p1)` are true. Analyzing the initial state, I see that I already have `supported(v12, #p1, v18)` as a fact. Now, I simply need to get the object `v12` to that particular pose `#p1`. Currently, `v12` is at `v13`.
           
           The initial state provides the necessary action instances, including the forward kinematics, base motions, and hand motions. These action instances offer valid plans to execute. Now, I need a plan to pick `v12` from its current pose (`v13`) and place it at `#p1`. Looking at the preconditions for `pick` and `place`, I notice a critical issue: the base must move to different configurations for each action ( `q2` for `pick` and `q3` for `place`).
           
           This necessitates a series of actions:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  First, I must move the base to the configuration `#q2`. This prepares for the *pick* action.
           2.  **Pick:** Then, I can execute the `pick` action to grasp and lift `v12` from `v13`.
           3.  **Move Base:** Now, I must move the base again, this time to the pose `#q3`, in preparation for the *place* action.
           4.  **Place:** Finally, I can execute the `place` action to set down `v12` at pose `#p1`.
           
           I've carefully checked that the pre-conditions, including kinematics, base configurations, and hand states, are satisfied for each action, and that any negated atoms are assumed to be safe. Therefore, this sequence should achieve the goal. I've double-checked all the variables, making sure that there is correspondence between the plan and the available actions and constants in the initial state and their corresponding facts. All is good. This plan, by satisfying `on(v12, v18)` and keeping `type(v12, v17)`, should satisfy the overall goal, `new-axiom@0()`.
