(Thoughts: **My Plan for Object Placement**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5, size 0.0803 x 0.0803) on a square surface defined by the coordinates (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  I need to determine the surface index, rotation angle (theta), and (x, y) coordinates for each placement.  The key constraint is that the entire object must remain within the surface boundaries.
           
           I've determined that the effective width/height of the object depends on the rotation. When aligned with the axes (0 or 90 degrees), the effective side is 0.0803. At a 45-degree angle, it becomes 0.0803 * sqrt(2) = 0.1135.  The allowable range for (x, y) varies with theta since the object's effective size changes.
           
           My approach:
           1. I'll iterate through 50 placements, calculating a unique theta for each.
           2. For each theta, calculate the effective object side (eff_s) and its impact on the (x, y) placement boundaries, varying the maximum and minimum values for x and y with the angle.
           3. To achieve a diverse set of placements, I'll use a circular distribution of x and y for each theta, ensuring they're within the allowed region for that angle. Specifically, I plan to move the center of the object on a circle.
           
           I'm confident this method will produce a set of valid and well-distributed placements.

(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Non-Colliding Placements for a Square Object**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a surface and a pre-existing object, and my task is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object on that surface, *without* the new object colliding with the old one. The existing object's position and bounding box are known, and I've also been given the size and bounding extents of my new object as a square. I've taken the approach of iterating through different rotations of my new object.
            
           For each angle, I calculate the object's effective side length, considering the rotation. Then, I work out the permitted area for its center, accounting for the surface boundaries.  Importantly, I have to ensure the bounding box of the new object does *not* intersect with that of the existing object to avoid collisions.  I've chosen to divide the surface into strips using the existing object's bounding box to construct available "regions" where it is safe to place my object. By generating multiple possible placements within the valid strips at different rotations, I can generate a wide range of different candidate placements to pick from.  Because the strips are carefully constructed so that *at least* one half-plane condition from the previous object's non-overlap is satisfied. By the nature of the construction, no valid placements should collide. I've chosen to break up the surface into smaller pieces to ensure diversity in my selection. I will construct many possible placements and only the first 50 will be picked.  I believe this will give a diverse and useful set of placement candidates.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 6**
           
           I'm tasked with placing 50 stable instances of Object 6, a square, on Surface 0, while avoiding collisions with two existing objects, Object 4 and Object 5. My primary goal is to ensure these placements are collision-free.
           
           First, I'll define the search space. Surface 0 has defined minimum and maximum X and Y coordinates. Object 6's size is also provided. To efficiently manage the problem, I will use AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) for each object because they simplify collision detection, I'll begin by calculating AABB for the pre-placed objects (Object 4 and Object 5). Since they are not rotated, the AABB is straightforward to compute from their center coordinates and size. Then, by inflating those by Object 6's maximum radius (taking the half side length of the square) I can quickly get the zones that are forbidden for the placement of the center.
           The allowed area for Object 6's center is constrained by the surface boundaries and the collision zones around Object 4 and Object 5.
           
           Given a rotation angle (theta) for Object 6, its effective size changes; I have to take into account the "effective" size (taking into account the rotation of Object 6). The allowed range for Object 6's center coordinates (x, y) is then determined by the surface boundaries and this effective size for each rotation.
           
           To find collision-free placements, I will sample a range of theta values (specifically, 10 angles between 0 and 2*pi). For each theta:
           1.  Calculate the effective size and the allowed range for Object 6's center.
           2.  I generate a grid of potential center points within the allowable range.
           3.  I check each potential center point against the collision zones defined by Object 4 and Object 5. If a point is collision-free, I mark it as a valid placement.
           
           A crucial function in this strategy is `aabb_overlap` which performs AABB overlap tests, by ensuring that there are no overlaps in the X and Y bounds of the rectangles.
           
           I'm using this grid-based approach with careful AABB calculations, and rotation consideration because it is straightforward and offers a direct way to solve the problem by creating a robust and efficient solution for finding collision-free placements within a defined area.
