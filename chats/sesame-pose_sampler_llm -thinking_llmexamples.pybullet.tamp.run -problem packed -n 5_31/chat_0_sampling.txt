(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, square dimensions 0.09673 x 0.09673) on a square surface (surface 0, bounds (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           First, I've got to ensure the object's bounding box stays entirely within the surface. The tricky part is rotation (`theta`). A square object's bounding box changes size with `theta`. Specifically, its effective half-dimensions are given by `L * (|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|)` where `L` is half the object's side length (0.048365).  The most constraining orientation is when `theta` is a multiple of `pi/4` because that's when the AABB is at its largest.
           
           To get a diverse set of placements, I'll do this:
           
           1.  **Vary Rotation:** I'll use 10 different rotation angles, starting from 0 and incrementing by pi/18 (going up to pi/2, since the square's effective bounding box repeats after pi/2)
           
           2.  **Calculate Effective Bounds:** For each `theta`, I'll calculate the *effective half-dimension* (EHD) of the *rotated* bounding box. Then, I'll calculate the *x* and *y* bounds based on these dimensions.  That means the x and y coordinates of the object have to be within the square surface bounds, *minus* the EHD in each direction.
           
           3.  **Place the Object:** I'll place the object at five different positions for each rotation:
               *   (0, 0)
               *   The corners of the bounding area.
           
           This should give a diverse spread of placements across different orientations.  Since this is the first request for this object, I don't need to worry about collisions with other objects yet. It's a clean slate! And since I'm placing the object within the smallest possible bounding box at each rotation, everything should be stable.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Placing Object 4**
           
           Alright, here's the plan. I've got object ID 4, a square roughly 0.072 units on a side, to place on surface 0, avoiding the existing object ID 5. Object 5 is already at a specific location, corner-to-corner in the bottom-left of the surface.
           
           **The Key Constraints:**
           
           *   **No Collision:** Object 4's bounding box (even at any rotation) *cannot* overlap the area where object 5 sits.  This means its AABB must be *outside* of object 5's bounds.
           *   **Surface Bounds:** Surface 0 is a square, 0.27 units on a side, centered at the origin.  Object 4 needs to stay *inside* this surface.
           *   **Stability:**  I need to ensure the placement is stable by placing the object in a valid position in the surface.
           
           **My Approach:**
           
           1.  **Understand the Space:**  I need to figure out where I *can* place object 4. I know the surface's dimensions, and I've calculated object 5's AABB.  By knowing the object's dimensions and rotation I can calculate its bounding box.
           2.  **Rotation & Effective Size:**  I know that rotating object 4 changes its effective footprint.  I need to account for this change, meaning that I account for the `effective_L_obj4(theta) = L_obj4 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`
           3.  **Collision Avoidance:**  To avoid object 5, I will check that the center of object 4 is *outside* the collision range of the existing object.
           4.  **Valid Placements:**
               *   I'll calculate the valid range for the center of object 4 on the surface, considering its rotation.
               *   To be safe, I know the corner object 5 will occupy.  Object 4 *must not* overlap the region `x <= -0.03827` and `y <= -0.03827`, in order to avoid a collision.
           5.  **Placement Locations** I will use a series of calculations to generate 50 positions.
           6. **Generate the Positions:** I'll determine the maximum extent of Object 4 at each degree of rotation, and use 5 placements.  This ensures good coverage of the surface and no collision with the current object.
           
               I will use the following points:
           
               *   Top Right, Top Left
               *   Top Right, Middle Top and Middle Right
               *   Top-Right Quadrant Center.
           
           I have performed a preliminary analysis and identified the correct set of steps that will produce the requested results.

(Thoughts: **Surface Placement Strategy for Object 8**
           
           My primary goal is to determine 50 stable and collision-free placements for a new object (ID 8) on surface 0, taking into account existing objects (ID 5 and ID 4) and ensuring stability. The surface's usable area is a square of `0.27` units.
           
           First, I need to account for surface and object dimensions. Object 8 has an effective half-dimension, which will vary based on its rotation (`theta`). The range of possible object centers will depend on `theta` to maintain the object's contact with the surface. These valid ranges exclude both the bottom-left and the top-right portions of the table, as these are occupied by object ID 5 and ID 4.
           
           I will systematically generate 10 placements across a `pi/2` rad range, for a total of 50. I'll define an effective half-dimension based on `theta` by using its sine and cosine functions.
           
           Next, I'll calculate the stable and collision-free bounds for each rotation angle. This means I'll identify regions on the surface where a placement will avoid collisions with the existing objects and will lie on a stable surface. I will test these conditions based on the AABBs of these objects.
           
           I will choose five placements for each rotation:
           *   A top-left corner placement.
           *   A bottom-right corner placement.
           *   The center of a horizontal strip.
           *   The center of a vertical strip.
           *   One additional mixed-quadrant placement.
           
           I'll iterate through each angle to confirm the valid bounds, and then calculate and choose object positions that meet the constraints. The goal is a systematic but flexible means of placing ID 8 to meet the needs.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of a New Object (ID 7): Avoiding Collisions and Ensuring Stability**
           
           My primary goal is to find 50 stable and collision-free placements for a new object (ID 7) on Surface 0. I'm viewing three existing objects (IDs 5, 4, and 8) as obstacles and must respect the geometry of the surface (a square defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`) as well as the object's own dimensions.
           
           I've carefully calculated the bounding boxes (AABBs) for each of the three obstacles:
           
           1.  **Object 5**: Positioned near the bottom-left corner.
           2.  **Object 4**: Positioned near the top-right corner.
           3.  **Object 8**: Positioned near the top-left corner.
           
           These AABBs, along with the object's dimension, dictate the "forbidden" zones on the surface. To determine the safe placements I'm using an analytical approach. I will consider the rotation angle of the new object, analyzing the resulting changes to its AABB. My overall goal is to identify a simple and systematic method to identify safe regions. This is because creating a placement strategy based on directly calculating specific regions with complex geometry becomes computationally expensive.
           
           **Placement Strategy:**
           
           *   **Step 1 - Identifying Free Regions**: First, I'll calculate the valid regions by considering the surface bounds and subtracting the obstacle's bounding boxes. I determined an analytical method that creates the best positions.
           *   **Step 2 - Safe Points**: I've determined that the bottom-right corner of the surface is always safe, regardless of the angle, and will use it to place 10 objects.
           *   **Step 3 - Vertical Strip**: For the remaining 40, I'll identify the region to place them at a vertical strip on the surface.
           *   **Step 4 - Horizontal Strip**: For the next 40, I'll identify the region to place them at a horizontal strip.

           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable locations for a new, square object (ID 6) on a square surface (0.27m x 0.27m) while avoiding four pre-placed objects (IDs 5, 4, 8, and 7). This surface is essentially a 2D plane.  The challenge lies in the tight fit and ensuring no overlaps.
           
           First, I need to understand the space. Surface 0 is a square, and I know the exact locations and sizes of the existing objects, described by their center coordinates and dimensions. My new object, ID 6, is also a square (0.082045m x 0.082045m). The orientation (rotation angle, *theta*) of ID 6 will affect how much space it occupies. I will use 10 different angles for *theta* that are evenly spaced.
           
           To prevent collisions, I will calculate the minimal "safe region" where the object can be placed. The bounding box of the object at any angle is a square, but the effective length changes with the angle.  The key is to use the bounding box calculations for each object at each angle. 
           
           The primary constraint is that the center of the object must be within the surface boundaries.  The object should not collide with any of the existing objects. The existing objects are in the corners of the surface.  This leaves a small space for the object's center.  The new object, being slightly too large, implies that collisions are likely when at the center (0,0).  Thus the optimal locations are outside of the central (0,0) point.  There is not enough space between corners to place the object without partial overlap. Thus the object must be placed in a corner and it will be offset from each of the other objects. 
           
           I then devised a systematic approach.  For a given rotation angle, I will search for several candidate placements near the center.  I will verify that these positions will not collide with the AABB of any existing object.  If the position is valid, I'll store it.  Then, I'll move on to the next set of angle and candidate locations until I have found 50 valid placements.
