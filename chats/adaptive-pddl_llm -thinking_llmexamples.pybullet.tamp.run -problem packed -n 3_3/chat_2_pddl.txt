(Thoughts: **Strategic Plan for Object Stacking**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is crystal clear: get those three objects – `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` – stacked neatly on `v16`.  Currently, they're all resting on `v11`, but that's not where they need to be. The guiding principle here is the `on` axiom: to be "on" something means you must be at a specific pose and supported by it.
           
           First, I need to understand what I'm working with.  I've got `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` to manipulate, along with the arms, the base configuration, and specific poses, supported relationships, and also importantly, the available `kin` actions. My primary tool is the arm `v4`.  It's the only one with the relevant kinetic information to pick and place. There are also associated `kin` facts that dictate which arm configurations, base configurations, grasp and trajectories are needed.
           
           The real key here lies in using those `kin` actions to move the objects to pose `#o2` on top of `v16`. Since I can move the arm and the base, the question is how to get each object from their current locations, `v9`, `v13`, and `v15`, onto `v16` in an efficient manner.  The initial state says `supported(?o, #o2, v16)` for each of the objects.
           
           Let's dissect the necessary actions:
           1.  **Base Movement:** To start, the base is at `v3`. The kin actions specify that `?q` is at `#o3` for all pick and place operations, so I'll initiate with moving from `v3` to `#o3`.
           2.  **Pick and Place Loop:** For each object (`v8`, `v12`, and `v14`):
               *   `Pick` the object from its current pose. I'll need to satisfy all preconditions for `pick`, which includes an arm that's empty, and base/arm configuration facts. Given a `kin` fact, all this is possible.
               *   `Place` the object at pose `#o2` on top of `v16`. Here also the same preconditions should be met.
           
           The core sequence, then, is: `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` followed by a straightforward series of `pick` and `place` operations. I will make sure preconditions, such as the `canmove()` predicate which is set to true after the `pick` action, are satisfied before each action. No unsafe poses or trajectories are mentioned, so I can assume those predicates are false.  This should set everything up in the right order. This looks solid, and I can be confident that following this plan will get the objects stacked properly.
