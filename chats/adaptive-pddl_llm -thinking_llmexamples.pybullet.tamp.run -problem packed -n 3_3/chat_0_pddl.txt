           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan that achieves the goal of placing objects v8, v12, and v14 "on" object v16. This "on" condition is defined as both "supported" by v16 and at a specific "pose" on v16.  Currently, these objects are supported by and posed on v11.
           
           To reach this goal, I've determined that a sequence of "pick" and "place" actions are essential.  Each object must be picked from its current location (v11), and then placed onto v16. This involves manipulating the "atpose" facts for each object.  However, the only allowed action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action doesn't modify "atpose".
           
           This significantly restricts my planning. The problem statement explicitly limits allowed action instances to those provided.  Without the ability to "pick" and "place", it's impossible to manipulate the "atpose" predicates for the target objects. Since "on" is an axiom relying on `supported` and `atpose`, moving the objects to the target poses is infeasible with the allowed actions. Therefore, this goal is unattainable under the current constraint.
