           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've devised to achieve the new axiom.**
           
           First, I need to make sure that the continuous parameters are correctly understood. Since the only movement actions available are "stay put" moves, any continuous parameter within an action's `atconf` precondition must correspond to the rover's current location. For rover `v12`, that's `v13`, and for `v14`, it's `v15`.
           
           The plan hinges on two rovers: `v12` and `v14`, each equipped with a camera `v10` and needing to use the "store" `v16` (implicitly a separate capacity for each rover).
           
           1.  **For Rover `v14`:**
               *   `calibrate(v14, v15, #o4, v17, v10)`: Calibrates the camera (continuous parameter #o4 is just the visible ray).
               *   `take_image(v14, v15, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`: Takes an image of object `v17` in mode `v11`.
               *   `send_image(v14, v15, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`: Sends the image to the lander `v9`.
               *   `sample_rock(v14, v15, v3, v16)`: Samples rock `v3` into the store.
               *   `send_analysis(v14, v15, #o1, v9, v3)`: Sends the analysis of `v3`.
               *   `drop_rock(v14, v16)`: Drops the sample, freeing its store.
           
           2.  **For Rover `v12`:**
               *   `calibrate(v12, v13, #o4, v18, v10)`: Calibrates the camera for rover `v12`.
               *   `take_image(v12, v13, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`: Takes an image of `v18`.
               *   `send_image(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`: Sends the image.
               *   `sample_rock(v12, v13, v7, v16)`: Samples rock `v7`.
               *   `send_analysis(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v7)`: Sends the analysis of `v7`.
               *   `drop_rock(v12, v16)`: Drops the sample.
           
           This should achieve the goal of `new-axiom@0()`, fulfilling all predicates.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v14 v15 #o4 v17 v10), (take_image v14 v15 #o4 v17 v10 v11), (send_image v14 v15 #o1 v9 v17 v11), (sample_rock v14 v15 v3 v16), (send_analysis v14 v15 #o1 v9 v3), (calibrate v12 v13 #o4 v18 v10), (take_image v12 v13 #o4 v18 v10 v11), (send_image v12 v13 #o1 v9 v18 v11), (sample_rock v12 v13 v7 v16), (send_analysis v12 v13 #o1 v9 v7)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **A Dead End with Limited Tools**
           
           Okay, so I've been focusing on this problem and missed a crucial detail. The user just pointed out that my previous plan included actions that aren't on the approved list. This really changes things. I need to rethink this based solely on the four permitted actions.
           
           Let me refresh my memory on the allowed actions: we've got a couple of redundant `move` actions – basically, moving something *to* where it already is – and two `drop_rock` actions. Now, I'm aiming for `new-axiom@0()`, which breaks down into a set of conditions.
           
           I've already checked the initial state, and it seems like half the battle is already won. The `atconf` and `free` conditions are initially satisfied. The problem lies with these: `receivedimage` for two variables, and `receivedanalysis` for a stone and soil sample.
           
           Now, those `move` actions? Completely useless in this context. And the `drop_rock` actions? They might be relevant if the rovers were *full* of something at location `v16`, but they're not. They just change the `free` state, which is already true. So, the only way to even use them is if the corresponding `full` predicate were true, but that is not the case.
           
           The real roadblocks are `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`. I know that to get those, I'd need to use actions like `send_image`, `send_analysis`, `take_image`, `calibrate`, and `sample_rock`. But guess what? None of those actions are in the approved list!
           
           So, the bottom line is that I'm stuck. The current goal *cannot* be reached with the tools I've been given. It's essentially an impossible task given this restricted set of actions. This is not a situation where I need to be more clever, rather I am simply unable to accomplish the goal under the given constraints.
