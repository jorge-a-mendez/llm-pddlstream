               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable with Provided Actions**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan to arrange specific objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`) onto a designated surface (`v18`). The initial problem description defines the necessary conditions to achieve this, based on the `on(?o, ?r)` predicate which depends on `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`.
           
           My initial strategy was to analyze the initial state of each object, particularly their poses and supports. I deduced that each object is initially resting on `v11`, a likely base surface. To achieve the goal, I need to pick and place each object onto `v18` by executing pick and place actions, and the only viable place is `pose(object, #o2)` since `supported(object, #o2, v18)` is true.
           
           The difficulty arose when examining the *allowed* actions. The task explicitly limits me to those actions *provided* in the list of valid action instances. However, the *only* action provided is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action manipulates the base configuration of the robot and `canmove()` predicate, but it *cannot* alter the `atpose` or `supported` predicates, which are crucial for modifying the `on` state of the objects.
           
           Therefore, because no `pick` or `place` actions (the only actions capable of achieving my goal) are *included* in the list of permissible actions, the objective of placing the four objects on `v18` is *impossible* to achieve with the given constraints. The task is fundamentally unsolvable with the provided action set.
