(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation for Object ID 4**
           
           Alright, let's get this done. I need to place object ID 4, a square with extents (0.0973, 0.0973), on surface 0, which is a square region from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). The goal?  Fifty *stable* placements, meaning the object's fully contained within the surface.  This calls for a solid, well-structured approach.
           
           First, I have to consider the bounding box of the rotated square.  While the initial object *is* a square (making rotations simple), it's crucial to account for the worst-case scenario.  A square's bounding box changes size with rotation, and its largest bounding box occurs at 45 degrees. I need the side length for the bounding box of a square of side `s`, rotated by `theta` to be `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This means I can easily calculate the required values.
           
           Now, considering the surface's boundary conditions, the center of the surface is at (0,0) with half-width 0.135.  So I need to ensure the object's bounding box is always *completely* inside the surface's bounds.  I'll define the available range for x and y placement depending on the theta value. The effective surface range will be `[-L,L]`, where `L = hs_surf - BB_s / 2` and `BB_s = s_obj * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. Here, `s_obj` represents the square's side length.
           
           My plan for diversity is straightforward: I'll use a few key rotation angles:  0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, and pi/2.  For each, I'll generate a grid of x,y coordinates within the available bounds. To generate a structured spread of 10 points within bounds, I will have a 3 x 3 grid of x and y plus one additional point in the area.
           
           So now to execute this. I have my L value for each of my theta values. I will now create the grids and combinations. Here are the 50 placements.

(Thoughts: **Collision-Free Placement Strategy for Object ID 5**
           
           I've been tasked with finding 50 stable, non-colliding placements for a square object (ID 5, side length `0.08756480103799771`) on a surface defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  This must be done while avoiding any overlap with a previously placed object (ID 4) whose placement and AABB I've analyzed.  ID 4's bounding box effectively covers the bottom-left corner of the surface.
           
           To achieve this, I'll leverage a rotation strategy around five key angles: 0, π/8, π/4, 3π/8, and π/2. I've calculated the maximum extent (L) for the square's AABB for each angle and now understand the thresholds for the object's center coordinates:  x_min and y_min must be greater than -0.03767 or x_min must be greater or equal to -0.03767, to be free of collision.
           
           To ensure non-collision, the approach is to generate a set of candidate points with the object's centers that satisfy the surface constraints (within the -0.135 to 0.135 boundary) and the no-overlap condition.
           
           For each rotation angle, I'll generate a list of 10 points that satisfy the collision criteria. It will be constructed by selecting the object's center points with the conditions described above.
           
           I am confident that the generated 50 points are collision-free.

(Thoughts: **Surface Placement Strategy for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I need to place object ID 6, which is basically a square with a side length of approximately 0.09897, a total of 50 times on surface 0, while avoiding collisions with objects ID 4 and ID 5 that are already there. Surface 0's dimensions are `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))` and that corresponds to the corners. Object 4's AABB is `[-0.135, -0.03767] x [-0.135, -0.03767]` and object 5's is `[0.04744, 0.135] x [0.04744, 0.135]`. The key is to compute the AABB of object 6, which depends on its rotation angle (`theta`).
           
           The collision avoidance strategy is simple: if the bounding boxes of any two objects intersect, they collide. So I need to place object 6 such that its bounding box doesn't overlap with the bounding boxes of object 4 or 5.
           
           First, I simplified the AABB calculation for object 6, given its square shape; I am just using the side length, `0.09897`, to calculate the half-side `h_BB_s6`. I am looking for 10 valid placements for 5 angles (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2).
           
           Here's the approach:
           
           1.  **Calculate the no-go zones:** For each rotation, I'll calculate the 'forbidden' rectangular regions for the center of object 6. These are basically expansions of the AABBs of objects 4 and 5 by `h_BB_s6`. The valid region is the surface, but with areas around the pre-existing objects' bounding boxes removed.
           2.  **Generate a Grid and Filter:** Instead of analytically trying to fit object 6, I will create a grid of candidate center points within the surface. For theta 0 and pi/2, the side will be the same. The side for other angles is derived by trigonometric methods. The grid points are then checked to see if their bounding box avoids collisions with pre-placed objects. The first 10 valid points found will be the solution for each theta.
           
           This should result in a set of 50 stable placements, ensuring that object 6 doesn't collide with objects 4 and 5. This method is efficient and will give a satisfactory set of placements for my requirements.
