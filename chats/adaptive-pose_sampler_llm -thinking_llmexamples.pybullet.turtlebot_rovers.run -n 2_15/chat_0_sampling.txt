User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Robot Base Position Strategy for a Target Point**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. I need to generate 25 (x, y) coordinates for the robot's base, given a specific target point.  The robot's base has to be within 4 meters of the target, and, of course, within the scene boundaries, which are a 5x5 meter square.  No problem so far.
           
           The real challenge? Avoiding the obstacles and making sure the robot has a clear line of sight to the target.  I've got a list of bounding boxes (AABBs) defining the fixed obstacles.
           
           Here's my approach: First, I'll analyze the scene.  It's pretty straightforward, a square arena with some rectangular walls and a bunch of smaller boxes scattered around. The most important obstacle is a thin wall right down the middle, along the y-axis (x=0). If the target is on one side of this wall, the robot's going to generally need to be on the same side, or very close to the ends of the wall, to have a clear view.  I need to keep that in mind.
           
           Since I don't have a pre-existing collision detection or line-of-sight checking system, I'm going to generate a bunch of potential base positions. I'll then filter these using some basic criteria.
           
           Given the target, I'll generate points in a circular pattern around it. I'll use different radii and angles to make sure I get a good spread of positions. I'll start with points 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3 and 3.5 meters away and a variety of angles. I'll prioritize positions on the side of the x=0 wall where the target lies, since there is no opening in the wall for line-of-sight.
           
           Then, I'll apply my filters:  Is the position inside the arena? Is it close enough to the target (within the 4-meter range)?  Does it intersect with any of the obstacle bounding boxes? And, most importantly, does my line of sight check with the x=0 wall not block my view? The x=0 wall check is the critical one.  I've got a robust line-segment vs AABB intersection check.
           
           If I'm short of the 25 required positions, I'll expand the generation range.
           
           I'm confident this approach will give me a diverse set of valid base positions that should work well.
