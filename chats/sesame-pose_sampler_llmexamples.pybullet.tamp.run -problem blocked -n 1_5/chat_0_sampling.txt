           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 5) -- 0.07000000000000028, 0.06999999999999995)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single surface, surface 0, which is a rectangular area defined by the coordinates ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)). The object (ID: 5) is square-like with dimensions approximately 0.07 x 0.07.
           
           To find stable placements, I need to ensure the object is fully contained within the surface boundaries. Since the object is small relative to the surface and has an almost square shape, a wide range of positions and orientations should be stable.
           
           I will iterate through surface 0 and place the object at various x and y coordinates, ensuring the object's bounding box (considering its current orientation) fits within the surface. I will use a rotation of 0 radians (no rotation) initially, and then explore other rotations.
           
           For an object with size `(sx, sy)` placed at `(x, y)` with rotation `theta`:
           The effective half-dimensions for collision checking with an AABB are `h_x = (sx * |cos(theta)| + sy * |sin(theta)|) / 2` and `h_y = (sx * |sin(theta)| + sy * |cos(theta)|) / 2`.
           The object's AABB will then span `[x - h_x, x + h_x]` in x and `[y - h_y, y + h_y]` in y.
           
           Surface 0: `x_min = 4.2, y_min = -0.6, x_max = 4.8, y_max = 0.0`
           Object size: `sx = 0.07, sy = 0.07`
           
           Let's start with `theta = 0`.
           `h_x = (0.07 * 1 + 0.07 * 0) / 2 = 0.035`
           `h_y = (0.07 * 0 + 0.07 * 1) / 2 = 0.035`
           
           So, for a placement `(x, y)` to be valid on surface 0:
           `4.2 + 0.035 <= x <= 4.8 - 0.035` => `4.235 <= x <= 4.765`
           `-0.6 + 0.035 <= y <= 0.0 - 0.035` => `-0.565 <= y <= -0.035`
           
           I will generate placements by varying x and y within these bounds and trying different rotations.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single surface, surface 0, which is a rectangular area defined by the coordinates ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)). The new object (ID: 10) is also square-like with dimensions approximately 0.076 x 0.076. There is an existing object (ID: 5) for which I have several successful placements. I need to place object 10 without colliding with object 5.
           
           Since no previous failures were reported for object 5, it means all the placements I tried for object 5 were stable with respect to fixed obstacles. Now, when placing object 10, I must ensure it does not collide with any previously placed object 5 instances. However, I am not given the specific placement of object 5. The problem states, "If you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene." This is a new object ID (ID 10), so I do not have to consider previous placements of object 5 as fixed obstacles for object 10. The prompt for this new request is for object ID 10, and it specifies "you must avoid collision between objects i and j" if I have already placed an object with ID i. Since no object with ID 5 has been "placed" in the context of the overall scene (the previous list was just "successes" from a previous request, not necessarily active in the current scene), I can treat this as a fresh placement task for object 10 on the given surface, without considering object 5 as an existing obstacle.
           
           Therefore, the task is to place object 10 on surface 0, ensuring it's within the bounds.
           Surface 0: `x_min = 4.2, y_min = -0.6, x_max = 4.8, y_max = 0.0`
           Object ID 10 size: `sx = 0.0762, sy = 0.0762`
           
           Let's start with `theta = 0`.
           `h_x = (0.0762 * 1 + 0.0762 * 0) / 2 = 0.0381`
           `h_y = (0.0762 * 0 + 0.0762 * 1) / 2 = 0.0381`
           
           So, for a placement `(x, y)` to be valid on surface 0:
           `4.2 + 0.0381 <= x <= 4.8 - 0.0381` => `4.2381 <= x <= 4.7619`
           `-0.6 + 0.0381 <= y <= 0.0 - 0.0381` => `-0.5619 <= y <= -0.0381`
           
           I will generate placements by varying x and y within these bounds and trying different rotations.
