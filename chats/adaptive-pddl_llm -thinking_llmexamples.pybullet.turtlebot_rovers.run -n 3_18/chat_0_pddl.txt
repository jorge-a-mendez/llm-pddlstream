           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunction of several conditions primarily focused on receiving images and analyses. To achieve these, I need to plan.
           
           **Understanding the Goal:**
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` demands I establish various facts.  Crucially, I need to obtain images of objectives (`v17`, `v18`, and `v19`) using a specific mode (`v11`), and receive analyses for a stone and soil type.  This implies I need to use the `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, along with necessary actions to set up preconditions.
           
           **Action Precondition Analysis and Dependencies:**
           
           *   **To get `receivedimage`:** I require the `send_image` action, but that requires `haveimage`, which in turn, requires a `take_image` action, which demands I first calibrate.
           *   **To get `receivedanalysis`:** I need the `send_analysis` action, dependent on `analyzed`, achieved through the `sample_rock` action.
           
           **My Initial Observations and Assumptions:**
           
           *   The rovers `v12` and `v14` are initially at configurations `v13` and `v15` respectively. Both have a free store, and crucial visibility is established with lander `v9`.
           *   The system states that I must assume the continuous parameter values like `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o4` correspond to the actual configurations the rover needs to be in for the actions to work. I have assumed all of these have a corresponding instantiation from `v13` or `v15` respectively.
           *   I also need to assume that `NegatedAtom blocked` holds true unless explicitly stated. This seems a common assumption in these rovers problems.
           
           **Plan Formulation & Issues with Restricted Action Instances**
           
           My initial plan was to use rover `v14`, and I had crafted the sequence based on the standard `rovers` paradigm: calibrate, take image, send image, sample rock, send analysis, drop rock.
           
           The problem here is I am only allowed the action instances:
           `move v12 v13 #o2 v13`
           `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`
           `drop_rock v12 v16`
           `drop_rock v14 v16`
           
           **The Critical Constraint**:
           
           Herein lies the crux of the problem: these provided *action instances* don't facilitate the core requirement! I can't calibrate, take images, sample rocks, or send analyses using these actions. The limited action instances effectively make my core goal unachievable.
           
           **Conclusion:**
           
           Given the restriction to only the listed `move` and `drop_rock` action instances and the requirement to establish `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` (which require other actions), I'm forced to conclude that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is *not* achievable.
