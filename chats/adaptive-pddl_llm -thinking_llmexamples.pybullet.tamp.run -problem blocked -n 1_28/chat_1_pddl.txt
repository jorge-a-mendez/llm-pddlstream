           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of Achieving new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to making an object of a specific `type` be `on` a particular surface. Specifically, I need to find an object, let's call it `?green`, that has the `type` `v17` and is `on` `v18`.
           
           Looking at my initial state, I can see that either `v8` or `v12` could be `?green` because they both have the correct `type`.  Now, the key is to get one of them onto `v18`.  For an object to be `on`, it needs to be `supported` by the surface and in the correct `atpose`. Conveniently, I have both `v8` and `v12` *already* supported by `v18`. So I only need to get them *at the right pose*.
           
           The problem is, to "place" an object, I need the robot to have the right *base configuration*. And this is where things get tricky.  The placement action requires a specific base configuration (`#o3`), determined by the `kin` facts. But the robot *starts* at `v3`. I need to change its base configuration to `#o3` to perform a `pick` or a `place` action.
           
           The system only has one `move_base` action, but it's a no-op! It keeps the robot in the *exact* position it's already in (at `v3`). There's no way to actually move to `#o3` with the given actions and preconditions.
           
           The `kin` facts and `atbconf` facts are at odds. Since there's no way to reach the configuration `#o3` necessary to place either `v8` or `v12` *onto* `#o2`, I can't achieve `atpose` with the correct pose. Therefore, neither `on(v8, v18)` nor `on(v12, v18)` is achievable. Given that I need *one* of those to succeed, I'm stuck, and the whole goal is unreachable with these actions and this initial state. The plan space is not connected.
