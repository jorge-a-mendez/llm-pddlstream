           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Feasibility Assessment: new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. The ultimate objective, `new-axiom@0()`, translates into a need to acquire images and analyses. Specifically, I need to receive images for four objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`) using mode `v11`, and also receive the analysis for at least one rock of type `v2` and one rock of type `v6`.
           
           Initially, I dove into the preconditions and found that the initial state already satisfied some of the prerequisites: `atconf` and `free` predicates. However, the crucial parts – `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` – were missing. This highlights the core problem.
           
           I then inspected the available actions – a very limited set: `move` and `drop_rock`.  The `drop_rock` action is blocked because the stores are initially free, not full. The `move` actions are essentially no-ops, doing nothing to advance towards the goal.
           
           The key actions I *need* are completely absent. I don't have the actions to calibrate, take an image, send an image, sample a rock, or send an analysis, which are the fundamental actions required to achieve the goal state.
           
           After carefully reviewing the axioms and the initial state again, I couldn't identify any hidden solutions or overlooked relationships. The setup is sound, there are facts available that *would* support the required actions if those actions were provided, but the *actions themselves* are simply not available.
           
           Therefore, with the given action set, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is demonstrably unreachable. The plan is infeasible due to the lack of necessary actions.
