           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Logic Behind My Plan**
           
           Okay, here's what I've figured out. My ultimate goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object (`?green`) *on* a surface (`v18`) and knowing its type (`v17`). Since I already know the object's type, my main task is to get the object *on* `v18`.
           
           To make that happen, I need the object to be "on" the surface (`v18`), which means it needs to be *supported* by that surface *and* in a specific *pose* on the surface. Luckily, I already know that this object *can* be supported by this surface, and I have a pre-defined pose for it.
           
           The plan: First, I need to get into position. I need to move the robot base from its current configuration (`v3`) to a base configuration (`#q2`) that's appropriate for the picking action. Then, I will *pick* the object from its initial pose (`v13`). Next, I need to move the robot base to another config (`#q3`). Finally, I will *place* the object at the target pose, which is on the surface (`v18`). I've identified the specific pose (`#p0`) that satisfies the requirements.
           
           I have to carefully construct an environment in the robot's physical space that makes the preconditions for each action valid. I need to make sure the robot can move where it needs to, and that the pick and place actions don't result in collisions. I can assume those preconditions hold if I'm diligent about the base movements and picking and placing in space. With the proper pose, and base and arm movement trajectories, I will be in a position to complete the required task.
           
           In short, it's a series of moving the base, then pick and place: 
           1. move base from `v3` to `#q2`
           2. pick from `v13`
           3. move base from `#q2` to `#q3`
           4. place at `#p0` on `v18`.
