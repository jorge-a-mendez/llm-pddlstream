User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is primarily a large open square from (-2.5, -2.5) to (2.5, 2.5), bounded by thin obstacles. There's a vertical obstacle (5) in the middle at x=0, which divides the space into two halves. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the scene. I will focus on finding positions within the max_range=2 from the target point and within the overall x and y limits. I'll prioritize positions that are further away from the obstacles.

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The previous target point was (0.0, 0.0), and the proposed positions were relative to that. The current target point is (-0.2999423146247864, 1.839309811592102).
           
           The failure for (1.414, 1.414) was a collision with obstacle 16: ((1.1787948512574227, 1.5342782640000374), (1.3191311455229728, 1.6746145582655876)). This means positions in this general area need to be avoided when the target is in the upper right quadrant.
           
           The failure for (-1.414, 1.414) was "not reachable for robot base," which likely means it was outside the x or y limits of [-2.5, 2.5] when considering the actual target.
           
           The failure for (1.414, -1.414) was "no line of sight to target." This indicates that there are obstacles blocking the view between (1.414, -1.414) and (-0.2999423146247864, 1.839309811592102). This line-of-sight is likely blocked by obstacle 5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)) if the target is to the left of x=0 and the base is to the right of x=0.
           
           For the current target point (-0.2999423146247864, 1.839309811592102), which is in the upper-left quadrant, I will try to find positions within a 2-unit radius, ensuring they are within the overall bounds and avoid known obstacles. Given the target is just to the left of the x=0 line and near the top, I will look for positions to its left or below it, avoiding obstacle 5 for any positions significantly to the right. I also need to be mindful of obstacles 8, 9, 10, 19, 20, 21 which are in the general vicinity of the target.

           (-1.2999 1.8393)

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The previous target point was (0.0, 0.0), and the proposed positions were relative to that. The current target point is (-0.2999423146247864, 1.839309811592102).
           
           The initial proposed positions (1.414, 1.414), (-1.414, 1.414), and (1.414, -1.414) were relative to (0,0) and thus didn't apply directly to the new target.
           For the *new* target point of (-0.2999423146247864, 1.839309811592102), the previous request's proposed positions were:
           1. (-1.2999, 1.8393) - this position is 1 unit to the left of the target.
           2. (-0.2999, 0.8393) - this position is 1 unit below the target.
           3. (-2.2999, 1.8393) - this position is 2 units to the left of the target.
           
           Since no feedback was given for these specific positions with respect to the *current* target, I will assume they were valid. The prompt states, "If you receive a second request for the same target point, it may be because the previous position collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene." Since I haven't received specific feedback for the last set of proposed positions, I will assume the previous request had some issue (perhaps with a non-fixed obstacle) and I should try to provide new positions that are still valid and diverse. I will try to maintain positions on the left side of the x=0 axis due to the target's position and the large obstacle at x=0 (obstacle 5) blocking line of sight if the base is on the opposite side. I will also try to vary the distance and angle from the target.

           The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point has changed to (1.9296990633010864, 1.985545039176941). This is in the upper right quadrant.
           
           Let's analyze the failures for this *new* target:
           1. Proposed position: (-1.7999, 1.8393) collided with obstacle 8: ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)). This makes sense as this obstacle is in the upper left, and the proposed position was there.
           2. Proposed position: (-0.2999, 0.3393) had no line of sight. This position is on the left side of the x=0 line. The target is on the right side. This confirms that obstacle 5 (the vertical bar at x=0) blocks line of sight when the base and target are on opposite sides of it.
           3. Proposed position: (-0.7999, 1.0393) also had no line of sight, for the same reason as above (obstacle 5).
           
           Given the target is at (1.9296990633010864, 1.985545039176941), which is in the upper right, I should focus on placing the robot on the right side of the x=0 line to avoid obstacle 5. I also need to be mindful of obstacles 7, 16, 21 which are in the upper right quadrant. Specifically, obstacle 7 ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) is a square directly containing the target, meaning positions *inside* this square are likely to be collisions, and positions very close might also be problematic.
           
           I will try positions in the upper right quadrant, close to the target, but avoiding known obstacles. I will try to place the robot within max_range=2 from the target.
