(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for a Square Object**
           
           My task is to determine 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5, size 0.09899322963893731) on a square surface (surface 0, bounds: (-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).  Since it's the first placement, I don't need to consider collisions.
           
           My approach will be to vary the object's orientation and position systematically.  The key is the object's half-extent, which changes based on the rotation angle. To ensure the object remains fully within the surface, I need to account for this changing extent.
           
           I'll generate placements at the surface index 0.
           
           I'll consider five rotation angles: 0, π/8, π/4, 3π/8, and π/2. For each angle, I calculate the allowed (x, y) range for the object's center.  I chose these angles because they represent key changes in the AABB of the rotated square. The x and y range are calculated by shifting the object bounds inwards by the half-extent h.
           
           For each of the five angles, I'll define a grid-like sampling (x,y) for 10 distinct points, designed to cover the feasible region uniformly.  I will have a grid of size 3x3 for the main space, plus a point at (0,0) in the middle. The values are chosen to cover various positions on the surface.

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. I've got a new object, Object ID 4, that needs to go on surface 0.  I also have to avoid hitting Object ID 5, which is already placed.  Here's the breakdown:
           
           **Understanding the Constraints:**
           
           *   **Object 5:**  It's a square, size about 0.099, placed at (0, 0, 0) with a rotation of 0 degrees. Its occupied area is a square AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of about 0.049 on each side, centered at (0,0).  That's the space I need to avoid.
           *   **Object 4:** Another square, size about 0.074.  It's surface 0 is a square region of 0.135 on each side.
           
           **My Goal:**
           
           Find 50 *valid* positions for Object 4. These positions must:
           
           1.  Be completely inside the bounds of surface 0.
           2.  *Not* overlap with Object 5.
           
           **The Strategy:**
           
           1.  Calculate how to place Object 4 within Surface 0.
           2.  Calculate the part of the area taken by Object 5.
           3.  Generate 50 *x, y* points in surface 0 that do not interfere with Object 5.
           
           **The Math:**
           
           For Object 4, it's half size is 0.0368. I also calculated the valid (x,y) range on Surface 0 by subtracting half-size from surface 0 dimensions.
           
           *   To avoid collision, I need the center of Object 4 to be far enough away from the center of Object 5's AABB. Specifically, the distance must be greater than half-size of Object 4 + half-size of Object 5 (about 0.086).
           *   I will test two angles: 0 degrees and 90 degrees (pi/2 radians).
           
           **Generating Placements for `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/2`**
           
           I will build a 15x15 grid of points inside the surface bounds.  For each point, I will check if it's too close to Object 5. Too close means if the collision zones overlap between objects. I'll need to make sure I get 25 points that are distinct.
           
           **Collision Check**
           I have now set up a grid, calculated the possible object placement points, and will filter based on collision zones to calculate the points. I will select the first 50 points that fulfill all the constraints, and those are the points I need.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing 50 instances of object ID 6, which is a square with a side length of 0.0755, onto surface 0. This surface is a square with half-width of 0.135, and it already has object ID 5 (a square with side 0.0989) centered at (0,0), and object ID 4 (a square with side 0.0736) at approximately (-0.1, -0.1). My primary goal is to find stable and non-colliding placements for object 6.
           
           My approach is focused on surface containment and collision avoidance, the fundamental concepts, of course. For any placement of object 6, I have to ensure its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) remains entirely within the boundaries of surface 0.  Since object 6 is a square,  I can calculate its AABB dimensions easily: (s_new / 2) * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))  where s_new is the side length.
           
           To avoid collisions, I need to prevent the AABB of object 6 from overlapping with the AABBs of objects 4 and 5. I calculated the collision threshold for ID 5 (the distance the new object needs to stay away from the center of ID 5) to be ~0.087. I similarly calculated the forbidden areas around objects 4 and 5.
           
           I decided to consider two rotation angles: 0 degrees and 90 degrees. These are straightforward cases that minimize the object's extents. To find the optimal locations, I started with the valid area of surface 0 and then removed any regions that collided. I generated a set of candidate (x, y) coordinates for placement, and then systematically checked for containment within the surface and collision with the two existing objects.
           
           After going through this process, I determined 25 valid placements. These locations were chosen for a 0-degree angle; I can use the same coordinates for a 90-degree angle. They prioritized placing in the corners, midpoints, and boundaries, far enough from the other two objects. The list of coordinates I came up with represent a safe and well-distributed starting point. These 25 coordinates are then to be used with both 0-degree and 90-degree rotations to provide the necessary 50 stable placements. I will then perform validation and checks and finalize the coordinates.
