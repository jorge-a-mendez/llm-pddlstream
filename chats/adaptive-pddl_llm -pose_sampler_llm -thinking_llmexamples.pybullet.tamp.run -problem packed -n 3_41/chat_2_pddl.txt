           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning the Stack**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is clear: get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`.  Based on my knowledge, `on(object, object)` is true if `supported(object, pose, receptacle)` is true, and the object is at that pose. Looking at the initial state,  `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are all supported at pose `#o2` by `v16`. So, it's a matter of getting those objects to pose `#o2`.
           
           The facts indicate that I have the kinematic information (the "kin" predicates) needed to perform the necessary pick-and-place actions. The plan will involve using arm `v4` with grasp `#o1`, from the base config `#o3`, utilizing a specific trajectory `#o4` for all operations.  The initial state includes various objects that are stackable and graspable.
           
           The current base configuration is `v3`, which means I need to start with a `move_base` action to get the robot in the correct posture for manipulation. That means that first, the base must move from `v3` to base configuration `#o3` (`move_base v3 #o3 #o0`).
           
           After that, the strategy is as follows:
           1.  **Move base:** Get to base configuration `#o3`.
           2.  **Pick and Place v8:** Pick `v8` from its current pose (`v9`), then place `v8` at pose `#o2`.
           3.  **Pick and Place v12:** Pick `v12` from its current pose (`v13`), then place `v12` at pose `#o2`.
           4.  **Pick and Place v14:** Pick `v14` from its current pose (`v15`), then place `v14` at pose `#o2`.
           
           Each pick-and-place action will require checking preconditions for the arm and ensuring hand emptiness. I'm assuming that the absence of `unsafe` predicates means those conditions are acceptable. The trajectory from pick to place will be pre-defined from the `kin` facts.
           
           Given the given facts about the support relations, all three objects, after placement at the target pose, will meet the goal state conditions. The current base configuration supports only the kin actions tied to `#o3`.
           It's a straightforward sequence with no obvious cost optimizations needed beyond ensuring the base is correctly positioned. The entire sequence is based on valid axioms and is safe.
