           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Problem Unsolvable Due to Action Restrictions**
           
           Okay, I've got a handle on this. The objective is clear: get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all stacked on `v16`.  Standard block-stacking problem, straightforward enough. My initial assessment of the state reveals the usual suspects: manipulable blocks (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`), surfaces (`v11`, `v16`), arms (`v4`, `v6` - though only `v4` is controllable here), and the base configuration (`v3`). The initial positions are well-defined: `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are currently supported by and *on* `v11`.  Potential placements *on* `v16` and `v10` are also represented, as the `supported` facts with `#o2` indicate.
           
           My usual approach would be to decompose this into pick-and-place subgoals, establishing a clear plan.  I'd start by grabbing a block with `v4`, moving the arm, and placing it on the target surface (`v16`). However, here's where things get interesting.  I've thoroughly reviewed the "available action instances", and the only action instance allowed is a `move_base` action, a rather unhelpful no-op that's just consuming `canmove()` for the base configuration. Crucially, I see *no* `pick` or `place` action instances.
           
           The prompt specifically states, "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." This means I'm effectively handcuffed. Without `pick` and `place` actions, I have no mechanism to alter the `atpose` facts of the objects. They're stuck where they are, *on* `v11`.
           
           I re-checked the goal conditions which are `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`. The goal is to set the `atpose` predicate for each object to its supported pose on `v16`. Since I can't modify the current actual locations (`atpose` facts), and the `on` axiom needs both a supported pose and the `atpose` predicate set, this goal is *unreachable*. I can't pick up the blocks, and so I can't put them down on `v16`.  This is a case of the problem being intentionally unsolvable due to the restrictions on the allowed actions. I need to explain the logical steps that reach this conclusion.
