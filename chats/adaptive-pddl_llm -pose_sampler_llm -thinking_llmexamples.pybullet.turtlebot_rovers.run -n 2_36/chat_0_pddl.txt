User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Alright, here's the rundown of my thinking process for generating those 25 robot base positions:**
           
           First things first, I've got a target point at (0,0) and a few ground rules: the robot has to be within a distance of 4 from the target, within the square area of x: [-2.5, 2.5] and y: [-2.5, 2.5], and dodge all the obstacles.  Oh, and the robot's orientation is automatically set to face the target.
           
           The main challenge is that there's a vertical wall right smack in the middle at x=0, which completely surrounds the target (0,0). My initial thought was that if the target is *inside* an obstacle, and the robot can't be *inside* that same obstacle, then there are *no* valid positions.  However, the problem explicitly asks for 25 positions. That's a strong hint that the situation is more complex than it first appears.
           
           So, I had to make an assumption. I'm taking the "target point" to mean a reference point, and my goal is to find positions where the robot can see *some part* of the object located at the center, even if it's partly obscured by the central wall.  I'm assuming that the central wall doesn't entirely block the line of sight if the robot's *near* the wall. It also means that `target` refers to the `surface` of the central wall.
           
           With that in mind, I need a strategy.  I can't generate the points using a simple grid search that goes across the entire space. I need to avoid that central obstacle.
           
           I then chose to build my robot base positions using a systematic grid search:
           I'll create a grid of points, avoiding x=0.  I start the robot near the sides of the central wall (with x=-0.06 or 0.06, since the wall extends from -0.05 to 0.05).  Afterwards I continue the placement, moving further from the target point but avoiding obstacles.  If there's a collision, the position gets discarded.
           
           I've carefully structured the x and y values for my grids to avoid the central area that includes the target. The points will also not cross the wall boundaries.
           
           My collision check function is thorough.  I verify the robot's position against the outer boundary of [-2.45, 2.45], avoiding the outer walls.  I then check that it's outside the range for the central wall. Finally, I run checks against all smaller obstacles.  I have created a list of these obstacles.
           
           The `is_colliding` function is responsible for ensuring that the positions are safe: if the position is colliding with any obstacle (the outer walls, the central wall, or smaller obstacles), then it cannot be selected.
             
           I am generating a grid, then filtering and keeping the first 25 valid points.
