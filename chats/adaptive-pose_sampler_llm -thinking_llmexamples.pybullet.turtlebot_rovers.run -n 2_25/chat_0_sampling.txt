User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Robot Base Positioning Strategy**
           
           Okay, so I need to find three possible spots for a robot within two units of a given target point. The robot's heading will be automatically set to face the target, so that's easy. I have to be careful about all these fixed obstacles in the environment, and I'll treat the robot as a point initially, since I don't know its size. I've also got to stay within the overall playing area boundaries, specifically x from -2.5 to 2.5 and y from -2.5 to 2.5.
           
           First, I need to understand the scene.  The outer boundary is a big rectangle (-2.5, -2.5) to (2.5, 2.5), but that area is defined by the fixed obstacles 0-4.  Obstacles 1-4 are the walls of a room that are just outside the playable area, while obstacles 0 represents the boundaries (which are the same for this scenario). Then there's a big vertical wall at x=0, and a bunch of smaller obstacles scattered around.
           
           My strategy is to generate candidate positions around the target point. They need to be within a two-unit radius. I'll make sure they're not colliding with any of the obstacles. I'll also implement a quick line-of-sight check to ensure there's no obstruction from the big vertical wall. I'll assume that the environment will handle more complicated line-of-sight checks against other obstacles. Diversity is important, so I'll try generating points at different angles and distances.
           
           Here's how I'll do it: First, generate points around the target at different distances (e.g., 1.9, 1.5, 1.0 and 0.5 units) and angles (0, 45, 90 degrees, etc.).  Then, for each proposed point, I'll check:
           1.  Is it within the playable boundaries?
           2.  Does it collide with any of the internal fixed obstacles?
           3.  Is the central wall (x=0) blocking the line of sight?
           
           If all those checks pass, it's a valid position. I'll keep generating until I find three valid ones, if possible.
