User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with walls at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5. There's a central vertical wall at x=0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered around the room, which I've taken into account. I will prioritize positions that are away from the known obstacles and the walls, and try to find diverse positions. I will also try to keep a reasonable distance from the target, within the maximum range of 2.

Model:     The previous attempts collided with obstacle 0, which is the vertical wall at x=0. My target point was (0.1066023246736287 -0.4554344444627197) and my proposed positions were all slightly to the right of this wall but directly in front of the target, which seems to have been the issue because the proposed positions ended up with an x-coordinate of 0.1066. My understanding is that the robot has some width, so putting the center of the robot at 0.1066 is too close to a wall that ends at 0.05. I will now try to place the robot further away from this wall, either more to the left or more to the right, and also try to move in a direction perpendicular to the previous attempts. I'll also use the *new* target point for this request.

Model:     The previous attempts all collided with the central wall. My new positions tried to find spots further from the central wall and also varied the distance and direction from the *new* target point. Since no feedback was provided on these new positions, I will assume they were not for the target point from the previous request (which was different from the target point that caused the original errors), and the system is just showing me the history of previous *failures*. Therefore, I'll continue using the new target point and my previous reasoning for picking a variety of positions.
