           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, here's the deal.  I've broken down this goal, `new-axiom@0()`, into its individual components. I've looked at what needs to be true for this to be satisfied. I've also examined the initial state of the problem and the *only* actions I'm allowed to use.  The problem is, the initial state doesn't contain the necessary data, and the allowed actions can't generate that data.
           
           Specifically, I need to achieve the following: I need to take pictures of objects, analyze soil samples, and receive both the pictures and analysis results. These are all facts that *aren't* currently true, so I need to generate them.
           
           To get those images and analysis results, I'd need actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. However, the problem specifies I can *only* use `move` and `drop_rock`. Neither of these actions even comes close to getting me to the goal state.  They only deal with moving around and dropping rocks!
           
           My analysis confirms that the actions needed to achieve `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` are simply unavailable.  So, I can confidently conclude that the provided goal is *unreachable* with the given constraints. There is no plan that can be made.
