           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Refined Strategy for Achieving the Goal: `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My objective is to satisfy the conditions outlined in `new-axiom@0()`, a complex conjunction of several atomic facts concerning image acquisition, analysis, and rover positioning.  I've systematically broken down the problem, focusing on the key actions required: acquiring and sending images and analyzing rock samples. The goal demands that I achieve `receivedimage` for four specific targets, obtain and transmit the results of analyzing one stone and one soil sample, and crucially, maintain the initial positions and "free" stores for both rovers.
           
           Initially, the first four conditions of `new-axiom@0()` (regarding initial rover configurations and free stores) are satisfied. I need to fulfill the image-related and analysis-related predicates. I've identified the following major steps to construct a plan:
           
           1.  **Image Acquisition and Transmission:** Using rover `v14`, I will first move it to an optimal imaging configuration `#o3`.  Next, I will calibrate the camera (`v10`) on `v14` for each of the four target objects (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`) individually, then take images with the camera in mode `v11`, then move to the lander configuration `#o0` to communicate the data. This will involve the use of `move` actions to move the rover to a specific coordinate configuration (#o3) to calibrate and take an image, then move back to (#o0) to send the image.
           
               *   `#o3`:  To ensure efficient imaging, I've computed the coordinates (0.04, 1.95) for `v14`  as the configuration for viewing the four target objects.
           
               *   The `imagevisible` predicates state that the rover must have a good line of sight to the target and be within range 2 for the objective.
           
           2.  **Analysis and Transmission:** Simultaneously, I'll leverage rover `v12` to acquire and transmit analysis data. Rover v12 will move to #o5 where it can sample the rocks and perform analysis.  Since the initial state includes the fact, `above(v12, #o5, v4)` and `above(v12, #o5, v5)`, I know there is an available position to be above both rocks. I will select the most readily accessible stone and soil rocks (v4 and v5, respectively). I'll command `v12` to move to configuration `#o5` which I will assume is above both rocks. I compute the coordinates as (-1.47, -0.44) as an effective position for the rover. In sequence, I will drop the first rock and then sample the next rock. Finally, I will use the `sample_rock` action to analyze the rocks and use a `move` action to move the rover to the communication configuration.
           
               *   `#o5`:  This configuration ( (-1.47, -0.44)) is optimal for `v12` to sample both chosen rocks.
           
               *   I will use actions such as `sample_rock` to analyze the samples, and then the action `drop_rock` to ensure stores are free.
           
           3.  **Rover Maintenance:**  Upon completing these tasks, each rover must return to its initial configuration with a free store.  This includes returning `v14` to its original position (-1.0, -1.75) and `v12` to (1.0, -1.75).
           
           By executing this coordinated plan, I believe I can successfully achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()` and provide the necessary image and analysis data while maintaining the constraints on rover positions and store availability.

The goal demands that I achieve `receivedimage` for four specific targets, obtain and transmit the results of analyzing one stone and one soil sample, and crucially, maintain the initial positions and "free" stores for both rovers.
           
           Initially, the first four conditions of `new-axiom@0()` (regarding initial rover configurations and free stores) are satisfied. I need to fulfill the image-related and analysis-related predicates. I've identified the following major steps to construct a plan:
           
           1.  **Image Acquisition and Transmission:** Using rover `v14`, I will first move it to an optimal imaging configuration `#o3`.  Next, I will calibrate the camera (`v10`) on `v14` for each of the four target objects (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`) individually, then take images with the camera in mode `v11`, then move to the lander configuration `#o0` to communicate the data. This will involve the use of `move` actions to move the rover to a specific coordinate configuration (#o3) to calibrate and take an image, then move back to (#o0) to send the image.
           
               *   `#o3`:  To ensure efficient imaging, I've computed the coordinates (0.04, 1.95) for `v14`  as the configuration for viewing the four target objects.
           
               *   The `imagevisible` predicates state that the rover must have a good line of sight to the target and be within range 2 for the objective.
           
           2.  **Analysis and Transmission:** Simultaneously, I'll leverage rover `v12` to acquire and transmit analysis data. Rover v12 will move to #o5 where it can sample the rocks and perform analysis.  Since the initial state includes the fact, `above(v12, #o5, v4)` and `above(v12, #o5, v5)`, I know there is an available position to be above both rocks. I will select the most readily accessible stone and soil rocks (v4 and v5, respectively). I'll command `v12` to move to configuration `#o5` which I will assume is above both rocks. I compute the coordinates as (-1.47, -0.44) as an effective position for the rover. In sequence, I will drop the first rock and then sample the next rock. Finally, I will use the `sample_rock` action to analyze the rocks and use a `move` action to move the rover to the communication configuration.
           
               *   `#o5`:  This configuration ( (-1.47, -0.44)) is optimal for `v12` to sample both chosen rocks.
           
               *   I will use actions such as `sample_rock` to analyze the samples, and then the action `drop_rock` to ensure stores are free.
           
           3.  **Rover Maintenance:**  Upon completing these tasks, each rover must return to its initial configuration with a free store.  This includes returning `v14` to its original position (-1.0, -1.75) and `v12` to (1.0, -1.75).
           
           By executing this coordinated plan, I believe I can successfully achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()` and provide the necessary image and analysis data while maintaining the constraints on rover positions and store availability.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Revising the Imaging Strategy:**
           
           My initial plan failed due to collision and reachability issues with the continuous parameters, specifically `x` values for the `v14` rover near the thin wall object `v21` (at x=0). I need to re-evaluate the parameters for both `v14` and `v12` to avoid collisions and ensure reachability, keeping `v21` in mind.
           
           Initially, I wanted to find a single pose for `v14` that could image all four objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`) using the `#o3` configuration and ray `#o4`. However, I realized the problem description implies that the system requires separate values for `#o3` for each rover and target pair.
           
           I found that because the objectives were spread over a 4 unit range in the x-axis, using a single location would be impossible, and it turns out that I can provide different continuous values for `#o3` for each imaging action. The `v14` will need to move to 4 different positions to take the images. I now need a plan for the various moves and actions involved in imaging with rover v14.
           
           **Revised Plan for Imaging and Communication:**
           
           My previous attempts made me realize that I must interpret the problem requirements as needing a unique pose per imaging target. Here's the revised plan:
           
           *   For `v14`, I will start from the initial location (`v15`) and move it to a specific `#o3` location for each objective (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`), making sure each location meets the criteria (no collisions, reachable, and in view of the objective within 2 units). The current best estimates are:
               *   `(#o3 v14 #o4 v17)`:  config is `(-0.38, 1.7)`.
               *   `(#o3 v14 #o4 v18)`:  config is `(0.62, 1.7)`.
               *   `(#o3 v14 #o4 v19)`: config is `(-1.96, 1.8)`.
               *   `(#o3 v14 #o4 v20)`: config is `(2.04, 1.8)`.
           
               Then, `v14` will use the calibrate and take_image actions to gather information. It will then communicate the images by moving to an `#o0` pose close to the lander. The suggested value for this pose is `(-1.5, -2.0)`.
           
           *   For `v12` to talk to the lander I determined that an `#o0` position close to the lander at  `(-1.0, -2.0)` is best. Since it will need to sample both stone and soil, I will not specify any positions for `#o5` even though this is mentioned in the prompt.
           
           **Revised Plan for Sampling:**
           
           The `v12` plan is simpler:
           
           *   Move from `v13` to sample point `#o5` which will then:
               1.  Sample the stone `v4`.
               2.  Sample the soil `v5`.
           
               Then, `v12` needs to move to an `#o0` location to send the analysis to the lander. I will be sure that this value for the position is reachable and that both conditions are met.
           
           **Ensuring Goal Achievement:**
           
           I will create a plan for both rovers to achieve all the goals. The imaging process will generate the images, which will be sent. Finally, the vehicles will report their positions as final steps. I will verify that all motion predicates are defined. I will check for all conditions to be met, including sending the image and samples.

Model:     The problem involves satisfying the `new-axiom@0()` goal, which requires specific actions by two rovers, `v12` and `v14`. The goal involves receiving images from four objectives and receiving analyses for a stone and a soil rock. The `atconf` and `free` predicates in the axiom are already satisfied in the initial state and must be true at the end.
           
           The previous attempt failed due to collisions with obstacles and the target objects themselves, as well as reachability issues for communication configurations. Let's refine the strategy for selecting configurations.
           
           **Revised Strategy for Configurations:**
           
           *   **Imaging Objectives:**
               *   The robot needs to be *near* the objective but not overlapping with it or any obstacles.
               *   The `imagevisible` predicate has a range limit of 2 units.
               *   The previous issue was colliding with `v17, v18, v19, v20` and fixed obstacles `v22, v23, v24, v25`. These fixed obstacles are positioned near the objectives. We need to select a point that is just outside these obstacles but still within imaging range.
               *   For `v17` (center (-0.38, 1.83), obstacle `v22` (lower=(-0.75, 1.75), upper=(-0.25, 2.25))): Try `(-0.9, 1.9)`. Distance to `v17` center is `sqrt((-0.9 - -0.38)^2 + (1.9 - 1.83)^2)` = `sqrt((-0.52)^2 + (0.07)^2)` = `sqrt(0.2704 + 0.0049)` = `sqrt(0.2753)` ~ 0.52 units. This is well within 2 units and outside `v22`.
               *   For `v18` (center (0.62, 1.86), obstacle `v23` (lower=(0.25, 1.75), upper=(0.75, 2.25))): Try `(0.9, 1.9)`. Distance to `v18` center is `sqrt((0.9 - 0.62)^2 + (1.9 - 1.86)^2)` = `sqrt((0.28)^2 + (0.04)^2)` = `sqrt(0.0784 + 0.0016)` = `sqrt(0.08)` ~ 0.28 units. This is well within 2 units and outside `v23`.
               *   For `v19` (center (-1.96, 1.94), obstacle `v24` (lower=(-2.25, 1.75), upper=(-1.75, 2.25))): Try `(-2.3, 1.9)`. Distance to `v19` center is `sqrt((-2.3 - -1.96)^2 + (1.9 - 1.94)^2)` = `sqrt((-0.34)^2 + (-0.04)^2)` = `sqrt(0.1156 + 0.0016)` = `sqrt(0.1172)` ~ 0.34 units. This is well within 2 units and outside `v24`.
               *   For `v20` (center (2.04, 1.96), obstacle `v25` (lower=(1.75, 1.75), upper=(2.25, 2.25))): Try `(2.3, 1.9)`. Distance to `v20` center is `sqrt((2.3 - 2.04)^2 + (1.9 - 1.96)^2)` = `sqrt((0.26)^2 + (-0.06)^2)` = `sqrt(0.0676 + 0.0036)` = `sqrt(0.0712)` ~ 0.26 units. This is well within 2 units and outside `v25`.
           
           *   **Communicating with Lander `v9`:**
               *   `v9` AABB is `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
               *   `v21` is a wall at `x=0` `((-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), (0.05, 2.5, 0.1))`.
               *   For `v14` (initial `v15`: `(-1.0, -1.75)`): A communication pose must be close to `v9` and avoid `v9` itself. Let's try `(-1.2, -1.5)`. This is outside `v9`'s AABB and should be reachable. Distance to `v9`'s center (approx `-1.9, -2.0`) is `sqrt((-1.2 - -1.9)^2 + (-1.5 - -2.0)^2)` = `sqrt((0.7)^2 + (0.5)^2)` = `sqrt(0.49 + 0.25)` = `sqrt(0.74)` ~ 0.86 units. This is well within 4 units.
               *   For `v12` (initial `v13`: `(1.0, -1.75)`): It needs to move past `v21` (the wall at x=0). A communication pose close to `v9` on the negative x side, but not colliding with `v9` or `v21`, would be `(-0.5, -2.0)`. Distance to `v9`'s center is `sqrt((-0.5 - -1.9)^2 + (-2.0 - -2.0)^2)` = `sqrt((1.4)^2 + (0.0)^2)` = 1.4 units. This is well within 4 units and reachable.
           
           **Revised Plan:**
           
           *   **Rover `v14` (Imaging):**
               *   Move `v14` from `v15` to `#o3_v17_pose`. Calibrate, take image of `v17`.
               *   Move `v14` from `#o3_v17_pose` to `#o3_v18_pose`. Calibrate, take image of `v18`.
               *   Move `v14` from `#o3_v18_pose` to `#o3_v19_pose`. Calibrate, take image of `v19`.
               *   Move `v14` from `#o3_v19_pose` to `#o3_v20_pose`. Calibrate, take image of `v20`.
               *   Move `v14` from `#o3_v20_pose` to `#o0_v14_v9_pose`. Send all four images.
               *   Move `v14` from `#o0_v14_v9_pose` back to `v15`.
           
           *   **Rover `v12` (Analysis):**
               *   Move `v12` from `v13` to `#o5` (sampling pose).
               *   Sample stone `v4`, drop rock.
               *   Sample soil `v5`, drop rock.
               *   Move `v12` from `#o5` to `#o0_v12_v9_pose`. Send analyses for `v4` and `v5`.
               *   Move `v12` from `#o0_v12_v9_pose` back to `v13`.
           
           **Note on `motion` predicates:** The `motion` predicates provided in the initial state include several options for moving between configurations like `#o3`, `#o0`, `#o5` and the base configurations `v13`, `v15`. For example, `(move v14 #o3 #o2 #o3)` suggests that a rover can move between *different* instantiations of `#o3` (e.g., from `#o3_v17_pose` to `#o3_v18_pose`). This is critical.

(Thoughts: **Understanding and Implementing a Valid Plan**
           
           The initial plan was rejected because I used specific continuous parameter names (like `#o3_v14_v17`) instead of the generic ones (`#o3`, `#o0`) provided in the action instances. The system requires using the generic symbols, but the continuous values associated with them can be *different* depending on the specific rover and target.
           
           Essentially, I need to create a plan that uses the exact action instances, but interprets those generic parameters as *specific* instantiations for each (rover, target) pair. This means, while the plan uses  `#o3`, the `--Configurations--` section will assign  *different*  coordinates to `#o3` depending on which objective a rover is imaging.
           
           My understanding of the prompt now is that I can define different `#o3` and `#o0` configurations for *each* (rover, target object) pair, even though the action instances use a single symbol.
           
           Given this interpretation, I will reconstruct the plan as follows:
           
           *   For `v14` (the imaging rover):
               1.  Move to an initial `#o3` for imaging the first target.
               2.  `Calibrate` the rover at the current `#o3` for the first target.
               3.  `Take_image` of the first target.
               4.  Move to a *different* `#o3` for the next imaging target.
               5.  `Calibrate` for the second target.
               6.  Repeat steps 2-5 for the next two targets.
               7.  Move to `#o0` for communication.
               8.  `Send_image` of all four targets.
               9.  Return to the initial configuration (`v15`).
           *   For `v12` (the sampling rover):
               1.  Move to `#o5` for sampling rocks.
               2.  Sample the rocks.
               3.  Drop the samples.
               4.  Move to `#o0` for communication.
               5.  Send the analysis.
               6.  Return to the initial configuration (`v13`).
           
           The continuous values for the configurations will be determined based on their geometric validity:
           
           *   `#o3` (imaging) for `v14`: will be different for each target, chosen to be within 2 units of the objective and clear of obstacles to support line of sight.
           *   `#o0` (communication) for both rovers:  A single `#o0` will be used for both rovers to support their communication with the lander. This location will be collision-free.
           
           This plan structure will utilize the *exact* action instances provided and is geometrically sound now.

(Thoughts: **Revised Configuration Strategy for Rover Missions**
           
           Okay, here's my updated plan. The previous one failed due to persistent configuration issues - essentially, I was running into obstacles or losing line of sight. This revision focuses on resolving those problems by carefully choosing new, collision-free, and visible poses for imaging and communication. I'll make sure to follow all the given constraints.
           
           **Imaging Plan for Rover v14:**
           
           My primary goal here is to get v14 in position to image targets v17, v18, v19 and v20 and then communicate the results to the lander v9. I've re-evaluated the imaging poses and calculated new reachable coordinates for each target:
           
           *   **Imaging v17:** From the base at (-1.0, -1.75), I'll move to `(-1.0, 1.0)`. This position avoids the obstacles `v22`, `v23`, `v24`, and `v25`, while keeping v17 visible.
           *   **Imaging v18:** I'll move from my initial position to `(0.2, 1.0)`. This pose avoids `v23`.
           *   **Imaging v19:** I'll move to position `(-1.5, 1.0)` which avoids `v24` and `v26`.
           *   **Imaging v20:** My plan is to image v20 from `(1.5, 1.0)` to avoid `v25` and `v27`.
           
           For communication with the lander v9, I'll move v14 to the location `(-1.0, -1.5)`. This location provides clear, collision-free communication and is reachable.
           
           **Communication Plan for Rover v12:**
           
           To handle communication with the lander v9, Rover v12's motion plan stays the same. The focus is still on ensuring line-of-sight communication with the lander. I've confirmed that the best communication pose is (-1.0, -1.5).
           
           I'll execute my move actions using `(#o3)` as the placeholder for the imaging configurations and `(#o0)` for the communication location. I understand that I need to provide separate continuous value assignments for each instance of `#o3` and `#o0`.

           Okay, here's my updated plan. The previous one failed due to persistent configuration issues - essentially, I was running into obstacles or losing line of sight. This revision focuses on resolving those problems by carefully choosing new, collision-free, and visible poses for imaging and communication. I'll make sure to follow all the given constraints.
           
           **Imaging Plan for Rover v14:**
           
           My primary goal here is to get v14 in position to image targets v17, v18, v19 and v20 and then communicate the results to the lander v9. I've re-evaluated the imaging poses and calculated new reachable coordinates for each target:
           
           *   **Imaging v17:** From the base at (-1.0, -1.75), I'll move to `(-1.0, 1.0)`. This position avoids the obstacles `v22`, `v23`, `v24`, and `v25`, while keeping v17 visible.
           *   **Imaging v18:** I'll move from my initial position to `(0.2, 1.0)`. This pose avoids `v23`.
           *   **Imaging v19:** I'll move to position `(-1.5, 1.0)` which avoids `v24` and `v26`.
           *   **Imaging v20:** My plan is to image v20 from `(1.5, 1.0)` to avoid `v25` and `v27`.
           
           For communication with the lander v9, I'll move v14 to the location `(-1.0, -1.5)`. This location provides clear, collision-free communication and is reachable.
           
           **Communication Plan for Rover v12:**
           
           To handle communication with the lander v9, Rover v12's motion plan stays the same. The focus is still on ensuring line-of-sight communication with the lander. I've confirmed that the best communication pose is (-1.0, -1.5).
           
           I'll execute my move actions using `(#o3)` as the placeholder for the imaging configurations and `(#o0)` for the communication location. I understand that I need to provide separate continuous value assignments for each instance of `#o3` and `#o0`.
           

User:      Configuration #o3 = (-1.0 1.0) for rover v14 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (0.2 1.0) for rover v14 at target v18 is in collision with the following fixed obstacles:
           
           ```
           v21: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1))
           ```
           
           Configuration #o3 = (-1.5 1.0) for rover v14 at target v19 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (1.5 1.0) for rover v14 at target v20 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-1.0 -1.5) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-1.0 -1.5) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **New Plan and Configuration Summary**
           
           Okay, based on the previous failures in reachability and collision checks, I've had to carefully re-evaluate the object locations and constraints, especially considering the continuous imaging (#o3) and communication (#o0) values. The goal is to ensure each configuration is collision-free (no overlapping AABBs), occlusion-free (clear line of sight), reachable (rover can actually get there), and within the required range.
           
           The main obstacles are walls and rover/lander initial/fixed positions are:
           -   **Walls:** I have walls at `x=0` (`v21`), `x=-2.5` (`v26`), and `x=2.5` (`v27`) that I need to be aware of.
           -   **Rover/Lander:** The rovers start from `v15` at `(-1.0, -1.75)` and `v13` at `(1.0, -1.75)`. The lander (`v9`) is at approximately `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           
           My revised approach uses the following configuration:
           *   **Imaging:** For the imaging task, `v14` (the rover) will move to:
               *   `(-1.0, 1.6)` for `v17`.
               *   `(0.1, 1.6)` for `v18`.
               *   `(-1.6, 1.6)` for `v19`.
               *   `(1.6, 1.6)` for `v20`.
           
           *   **Communication:**  For communication, `v14` will go to `(-1.0, -1.0)`. `v12` does the same.
           
           *   **Sampling:** For sampling from the initial position, `v12` goes towards rocks `v4` and `v5` (handled by system, path assumed). The `sample_rock` actions should be fine.
           
           I've meticulously selected these points to avoid collisions, using the distances to the target objects as a check, as well as the initial `move` action. The distances seem reachable. The `motion` predicates for `v12` and `v14` will enable the planners to generate the path.
           
           The plan structure and the axioms look fine and everything is in order.

(Thoughts: **My Strategy Refined: A New Plan to Overcome Reachability and Collision Challenges**
           
           Alright, let's get down to brass tacks. The previous plan hit a wall – literally and figuratively – with reachability and collision problems. So, I'm going back to the drawing board, focusing on the tricky continuous parameters for imaging (#o3) and communication (#o0) while ensuring we nail those reachability checks and dodge every obstacle like a pro.
           
           Here's the new line of thinking:
           
           1.  **Re-evaluating the Landscape:** I've meticulously re-examined the layout, noting the rover starting points (v13 and v15), lander position (v9), objective locations (v17, v18, v19, v20), and those pesky obstacles (v21, v22, v23, v24, v25, v26, v27, v28, v4, v5). Crucially, I'm thinking about how the x=0 wall (v21) affects traversability and reachability.
           
           2.  **Rover Roles and Image Distribution:**
               *   **Rover v14 (starting at -1.0, -1.75):** I'll have v14 focus on imaging objectives v17 and v19.
                   *   For v17, I'll position v14 at (-0.9, 1.7) – avoiding v22 with a clear shot at the objective. Distance approx. 0.53, reachable and avoids v21.
                   *   For v19, I'll have v14 positioned at (-1.5, 1.7), giving me distance of approx. 0.51 and clearing all the obstacles.
                   *   For comms, I'll have v14 positioned at (-1.5, -1.5), distance approx. 0.64.
               *   **Rover v12 (starting at 1.0, -1.75):**  I'll task v12 with imaging objectives v18 and v20 and grabbing the required soil and rock samples.
                   *   For v18, I'll position v12 at (0.1, 1.7) to keep a safe distance from v23 and v21 and keeping the distance at approx 0.54.
                   *   For v20, I'll position v12 at (1.6, 1.5) to keep a safe distance and at a distance of approx. 0.64.
                   *   For sampling (v4 and v5), the plan has v12 move to the approximate (-1.0, -0.5).
                   *   For comms, I'll use (-0.5, -1.5) – requiring a crossing of the x=0 wall, but within range at approx. 1.48.
           
           3.  **Refined Execution Plan:** I've carefully reviewed and adapted the plan structure to consider a new image distribution system. Both rovers must send the images that they took so that we can satisfy the *receivedimage* constraints without too much redundant movement between the rover.
           
           By sticking to these carefully chosen coordinates, and keeping these parameters within range I am confident we can overcome those reachability errors and deliver the results we need.

(Thoughts: **My Refined Strategy: Reaching and Imaging**
           
           I've carefully considered the previous failures and the specific obstacles this time. The "not reachable" errors were likely due to obstructed paths or unrealistic target locations, and I'll address that in my revised strategy.
           
           First, I need to focus on reachability. The robots start at y=-1.75 and the imaging targets are mostly around y=1.8 or 1.9, which will require significant movement. The lander is at (-1.9, -2.0). I also need to account for the wall at x=0, which will require the rovers to traverse across it to reach the far side.
           
           **Rover `v14` (starting at (-1.0, -1.75))**
           
           1.  **Image v17:** Instead of going directly to v17, I'll aim for a waypoint at (-1.0, 1.0) since v17's x is similar to where v14 starts. This point is easily reachable via vertical movement, and the distance to v17 (approximately 1.03 units) is within the imaging range. This will be my `#o3_v14_v17` configuration.
           2.  **Image v19:** From (-1.0, 1.0), I can move to (-1.5, 1.0) to image v19. This is outside the obstacle and within 1.04 units of v19. This will be my `#o3_v14_v19` configuration.
           3.  **Communicate with v9:** I'll set a communication waypoint at (-1.0, -1.0), just to be safely away and nearby. The distance to v9 is about 1.34 units. This will be my `#o0_v14_v9` configuration.
           
           **Rover `v12` (starting at (1.0, -1.75))**
           
           1.  **Image v18:** I can set an easy image point at (1.0, 1.0). v18 is near to this point. I'll make this my `#o3_v12_v18` configuration. The distance is 0.94 units.
           2.  **Image v20:** From (1.0, 1.0), I'll image v20 from a configuration named (2.0, 1.0) and call that `#o3_v12_v20`. The distance is approximately 0.96 units.
           3.  **Sample v4 and v5:** I'll use (-1.5, -0.5) to sample stones and soil.
           4.  **Communicate with v9:** From the sampling waypoint, I can communicate to (-1.0, -1.0) which is around the v9. This will be my `#o0_v12_v9` configuration.
           
           I will ensure to map these specific coordinate configurations to the more generic `#o3` and `#o0` actions that the planner expects. These configurations are intended to maximize the likelihood of reachability while maintaining efficient paths and ensuring that the robots don't collide. The initial plan structure remains the same, with v14 handling its tasks in parallel to v12.
