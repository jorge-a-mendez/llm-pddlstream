(Thoughts: **My Approach to Generating Stable Object Placements**
           
           My objective is to determine 50 stable placements for an object (ID 7) with dimensions 0.0799 x 0.0799 on surface 0, an AABB from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  Given the object's square shape, its orientation (theta) doesn't influence its AABB footprint.  Therefore, I'll primarily use theta = 0, with a minor variation to theta = pi/2 for diversity.
           
           First, I need to define the valid placement area for the object's center. Considering the surface's extents and the object's half-extents (0.039963981927155945), the x and y coordinates of the object's center must fall within the range [-0.09503601807284405, 0.09503601807284405].
           
           To ensure I get 50 unique placements, I'll generate a grid of x and y coordinates within this valid range. A 7x7 grid (49 placements) plus one at pi/2 should do the trick.  I've calculated a step size of 0.031678672690948016 to divide the range into 6 intervals, giving 7 points: -0.09503601807284405, -0.06335734538189603, -0.031678672690948016, 0.0, 0.031678672690948016, 0.06335734538189603, and 0.09503601807284405.
           
           The first 49 placements will be generated by iterating x and y through this grid, while setting theta to 0.  For the 50th placement, I'll use x=0, y=0, and set theta to pi/2, for a little bit of variance.  The surface index for all 50 placements will be 0. I'll maintain high precision using exact calculated values. The surface's size and the object size imply this should work fine. I'm ready to proceed with generating the placements now.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Analysis and Strategy**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback indicating the successful placement of Object ID 7 at a specific location on Surface 0. Now, I need to find 50 stable placements for Object ID 5 on the same surface, ensuring it doesn't collide with Object ID 7.
           
           First, I've confirmed that Object 7 is positioned at (-0.0950, -0.0950) with a size of roughly 0.08 by 0.08, which means it sits snug in the bottom-left corner. Next, I considered the size of Object 5, which is roughly a 0.09 by 0.09 square. I've also identified the bounding box of the surface as -0.135 to 0.135 on both axes.
           
           To prevent collisions, I calculated a threshold around Object 7. Since Object 7 is at (-0.095, -0.095) with approximately a 0.08 edge, the non-collision rule is defined as: either the x or y coordinate of the center of Object 5 has to be greater than approximately -0.0105. This basically means I've established that Object 5's center must not be in the very bottom-left corner of the surface.
           
           To locate these safe placements, I will utilize a denser grid-based approach. I will establish a refined grid, iterating through different x and y coordinate combinations. In this grid, I will only select the points where either the x or y coordinate satisfies the collision rule. This way I ensure Object 5 has a valid and collision-free location. This grid will be slightly more dense, ensuring I can easily pick out 50 unique spots. I'll also add rotations for some placements to add variety.
           
           In summary, I'm confident this method will quickly generate 50 distinct and collision-free placements.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable locations for a square object (ID 4) on Surface 0, ensuring they don't collide with two existing objects (IDs 7 and 5).
           
           First, I defined the object's dimensions based on its provided `size_x` and `size_y` and determined its half-size values (`half_x`, `half_y`). Next, I calculated the valid placement area on Surface 0, which is a square bounded by  `surf_min_x`, `surf_max_x`, `surf_min_y`, and `surf_max_y`, considering the object's half-size. This resulted in minimum and maximum x and y bounds for placement.
           
           I then analyzed the two existing objects. For each, I calculated their Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) using the provided placement and size data. This is crucial for collision detection. Object 7's AABB extends approximately from -0.135 to -0.055 in both x and y, and Object 5's extends from -0.135 to -0.046 in x and -0.067 to 0.022 in y.
           
           Using these AABBs, I established the conditions to avoid collisions. I formulated inequalities to ensure that the new object's AABB doesn't overlap with those of Object 7 and Object 5. These conditions translate to the center coordinates of the new object (x_4, y_4) must satisfy a set of inequalities relative to the existing objects' AABBs.
           
           Given Surface 0 and the object dimensions, the center point must be within `[-0.097, 0.097] x [-0.097, 0.097]`
           In order to NOT collide with Object 7, the conditions are (x_4 >= -0.0175) or (y_4 >= -0.0175)
           In order to NOT collide with Object 5, the conditions are (x_4 >= -0.0085) or (y_4 <= -0.104) or (y_4 >= 0.059)
           
           I created a 9x9 grid of 81 candidate points within the valid area and checked each point against the collision conditions derived earlier. Based on their relative positions, those conditions simplify to rejecting any grid points where both `x` and `y` are less than -0.017, OR where `x` is negative and `y` is between -0.06 and 0.02. This essentially avoids the bottom-left corner and a vertical column of points, resulting in a total of 28 colliding placements (16 from Object 7 and 12 more from Object 5) and 53 valid points.
           
           The valid candidate points were the ones I could safely place Object 4. I will take the first 50 points to ensure that I will have enough stable object placements. For variety, a small subset can be rotated by 90 degrees.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning:**
           
           Okay, here's the deal. I've been tasked with finding 50 safe spots to place a new, square object (ID 8) on a specific surface (surface 0), making sure it doesn't bump into any of the objects already there (IDs 7, 5, and 4). First, I calculated the size of Object 8 and how it restricts where its center can be on surface 0, giving me the valid ranges for its x and y coordinates.
           
           Then, I calculated the minimum bounding boxes, AABBs, around the existing objects to use in collision detection.
           Based on the object’s half-extents, I also defined collision boundaries: If the center of the new object is on the left, right, above, or below the old one I know there’s no collision.
           For each existing object, I figured out the exact regions where placing the new object would result in a collision. Then I simplified these equations.
           
           I've generated an 8x8 grid of points across this valid area. The collision equations define a series of regions that I must avoid.  So, I had to ensure that new Object 8's center is not in the collision regions for the existing objects.
           
           I’ve then computed, from the boundaries, an 8x8 grid. I then checked each grid point to see if it fell into one of those collision regions, and if not, I added it to the list of valid placements. I made sure to include (0,0) with pi/2 rotation. The Python script generates 73 valid placements. I will select the first 50.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 6 on surface 0. Object 6 is a square, about 9 cm on each side.  I've calculated the half-extents, which is just half of that side length, to help with the bounding box calculations.
           
           The surface I'm working with (surface 0) is a square region measuring around 27 cm x 27 cm. Using this, I've figured out the valid range for the center of object 6 to be fully contained within that surface.
           
           Now, here's where it gets interesting. I have to avoid collisions with other objects that are already placed: objects 7, 5, 4, and 8.  I've taken the placement information and half-sizes of each of those objects and used them to create a set of collision constraints. Essentially, these constraints define regions where I *cannot* place object 6's center. I'm using the surface bounds to ensure my search stays within valid positions.
           
           To find these stable spots, I've created a 10x10 grid across the valid placement area. I determined the step sizes and generated a coordinate system.  Now, I'm checking each grid point to see if it collides with any of the other objects. I will filter out the points based on those calculated collision regions.

Model:     **Generating Stable Placements for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 6 on surface 0. Object 6 is a square, about 9 cm on each side.  I've calculated the half-extents, which is just half of that side length, to help with the bounding box calculations.
           
           The surface I'm working with (surface 0) is a square region measuring around 27 cm x 27 cm. Using this, I've figured out the valid range for the center of object 6 to be fully contained within that surface.
           
           Now, here's where it gets interesting. I have to avoid collisions with other objects that are already placed: objects 7, 5, 4, and 8.  I've taken the placement information and half-sizes of each of those objects and used them to create a set of collision constraints. Essentially, these constraints define regions where I *cannot* place object 6's center. I'm using the surface bounds to ensure my search stays within valid positions.
           
           To find these stable spots, I've created a 10x10 grid across the valid placement area. I determined the step sizes and generated a coordinate system.  Now, I'm checking each grid point to see if it collides with any of the other objects. I will filter out the points based on those calculated collision regions.  And if a point does *not* collide, then it's a valid placement.
