User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.768, 0.087), (-4.686, 0.168)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.727, 0.127, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.094, 0.996).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**
           
           Alright, let's dive into this planning problem. My goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially means getting an object of a certain type, specifically `?green` of type `v17`, onto the surface `v18`. From the initial state, I see I have two potential candidates for `?green`: `v8` and `v12`, both of the right type, but neither is currently *on* `v18`. The key here is the `on(?o, ?r)` predicate, which translates to the need to *support* an object on the target surface (`?r`). The provided `stackable` information confirms both `v8` and `v12` can be supported on `v18`.
           
           **Action Selection and Precondition Checking**
           
           Given the objective, it's clear I'll need a manipulation plan: I must pick one of those objects and place it onto `v18`. Since both `v8` and `v12` seem equally viable at first glance, I'll start with placing `v8`. The actions available are `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`. Cleaning and cooking are not directly relevant to the goal, so I'll focus on `pick` and `place`.
           
           To perform these, I first need to verify their preconditions, including my own kinematic capabilities, as indicated by `kin` predicates. The `pick` action depends on being in a valid base configuration (`atbconf(v3)`) and `handempty(v4)`. `kin` predicates specify the relationship between the base, arm configuration, object pose, and grasp, so I need to make sure the base configuration `#o3` maps to my current base config, `v3`. This is crucial for the feasibility of `pick` and `place`. Similarly, for a successful `place`, I'll need to check the presence of `kin` predicates and that I have the grasp.
           
           **Continuous Parameter Resolution and Collision Avoidance**
           
           Now comes the trickier part: the continuous parameter resolution. I have the continuous pose `#o2` for where to place `v8` on `v18`, so I must determine the best configuration of the robot for `pick` and `place`, including grasp parameters (`#o1`). I must also determine where object `#o2` goes on surface `v18`, using my spatial reasoning skills. From the AABBs, the logical position appears to be `(4.5, -0.3)` as that places the object centrally and is collision-free within `v18` on a surface assumed to be at `z=0.7` so `z = 0.8`.
           
           **Plan Refinement and Action Ordering**
           
           With that, I'll formulate my plan to *pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)* where `v9` is an initial pose, and *place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4_place)* onto `v18` to satisfy the initial conditions.
           
           **Finalized Plan**
           
           So, here's my plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`:
           
           *   **Plan:**
               ```
               (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4)
               (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4_place)
               ```
           
               *   *Poses:*
               ```
               (#o2 v8 v18): (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)
               ```
           
)

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment: Impossibility of Achieving the Goal**
           
           Okay, here's the situation as I see it. The user has provided me a severely constrained set of actions to work with. My initial approach, which likely involved `pick` and `place` actions, is off the table because the only allowed action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This boils down to the robot essentially staying put.
           
           My ultimate goal is to satisfy the `Atom new-axiom@0()` predicate, which, in the context of this problem, means having an object of type `v17` on surface `v18`. I've gone over the initial state, which includes objects `v8` and `v12`, both of type `v17`. However, they are currently supported by surfaces other than `v18`.
           
           The allowed action, `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, is effectively a no-op. While it has effects such as updating `atbconf(v3)` and `NegatedAtom canmove()`, it doesn't offer any mechanism to manipulate objects. It simply maintains the robot's current base configuration. I also noticed what I assume to be a typo in the provided PDDL, with the action's effects mentioning `atbconf(v3)` twice, when I believe it should reference different configurations.
           
           Given that the robot cannot actually move objects using only this action, and the objects I need are initially supported on different surfaces, it's pretty clear that the goal is unattainable. I see no way to achieve `on(?o, v18)` with the given constraints. The task is, unfortunately, impossible with the current action set.
