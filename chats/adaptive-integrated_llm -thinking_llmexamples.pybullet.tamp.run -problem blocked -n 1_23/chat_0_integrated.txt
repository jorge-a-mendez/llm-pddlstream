User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.768, 0.087), (-4.686, 0.168)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.727, 0.127, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.094, 0.996).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom canmove()
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)

           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unreachable Goal: A Frustrating Puzzle**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: `new-axiom@0()`, which boils down to ensuring an object, that I'll call `?green`, is *on* a specific object, `v18`, and has the right *type*. Easy enough, right? I immediately realize I can work with either `v8` or `v12` as they both fit the *type* requirement. That simplifies things.
           
           But now I have to figure out how to get one of them *on* `v18`. From the knowledge I have, I know something is *on* something else if it's supported by it and in the right pose. Looking at the initial state, I see that `v8` is supported *by* `v18` at position `#o2`. Same for `v12`. So, I really just need to *move* `v8` to `#o2`.
           
           The problem is, and this is a big one, all I'm given to work with is one action: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. It seems to just move the base around, which is completely irrelevant to my goal. The *move_base* action doesn't change `atpose` predicates, which I need to have the goal satisfied.
           
           I re-read the rules, and it hits me: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." It's like I'm playing a game where the only move allowed is to move the robot, but not to pick something up or move anything relevant. I can't construct the needed `pick` and `place` actions, since they are completely outside the constraint.
           
           So, here's my reasoning. To get `?green` *on* `v18`, I need to change its `atpose`. The only tool available moves a base, which will not work. Without `pick` and `place` (or other useful actions), this goal is simply unreachable. It's a frustrating situation; a classic case of being given the wrong tools for the job.
