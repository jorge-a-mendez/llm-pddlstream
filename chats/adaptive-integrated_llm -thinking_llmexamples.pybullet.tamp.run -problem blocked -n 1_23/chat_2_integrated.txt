User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.768, 0.087), (-4.686, 0.168)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.727, 0.127, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.094, 0.996).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal: Achieving `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan that fulfills the goal `new-axiom@0()`. Examining the goal's expansion, I recognize that it equates to having an object of a particular type ("green") placed on the surface `v18`. From the given information, `v8` and `v12` are potential "green" objects. Both objects already satisfy the condition of being the correct type. Therefore, my immediate focus narrows down to achieving either `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)`. Given that `v8` is currently closer to the target, the initial approach favors moving `v8`.
           
           The definition of `on` dictates that I require a supporting pose, `p`, for the chosen object (in this case `v8` or `v12`) on surface `v18`. Observing the initial state, I see that I have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. This implies that `v8` can indeed be placed on `v18`. Since I can make `on(v8, v18)` true by placing it at `#o2`, I will achieve this by picking up `v8` from its starting position and placing it at `#o2`. The available actions are robot hand `v4` and `v6`. However, only `v4` is `controllable` and usable according to the `kin` predicates.
           
           To execute this plan, the robot first must move its base from the initial configuration `v3` to a configuration designated by `#o3`. Then, I will pick the `v8` from its initial pose at `v9` and place it at a suitable `pose #o2` supported by `v18`. I need to calculate a continuous value for `#o2` so that the object is placed in a way it is fully supported. I also need to provide this calculated `pose` to satisfy the requirements of the problem.
           
           `v18` has AABB of `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`, indicating a surface area. Since the existing poses have the Z-value at 0.8, and both objects currently are on that surface, I'll place the object at the center of the available surface area with a Z-value of 0.8, with no rotation.
