           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 4) -- 0.09304907310729194, 0.09304907310729194)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single square surface centered at the origin, with extents from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y directions. The object is also square, with side length 0.09304907310729194.
           
           To find stable placements, I need to place the object entirely within the bounds of the surface. Since both the surface and object are square, and the object is smaller than the surface, there are many possible placements. The object can be placed at any orientation (theta), but for a square object, rotating by multiples of pi/2 (0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2) effectively results in the same orientation with respect to its bounding box. I will focus on theta=0 for simplicity, and then explore different (x, y) positions.
           
           The surface has a width and height of 0.27 (0.135 - (-0.135)).
           The object has a width and height of 0.09304907310729194.
           
           For a placement to be valid (assuming theta=0), the center (x, y) of the object must satisfy:
           lower_x_surface + object_width/2 <= x <= upper_x_surface - object_width/2
           lower_y_surface + object_height/2 <= y <= upper_y_surface - object_height/2
           
           Substituting the values:
           -0.135 + 0.09304907310729194/2 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.09304907310729194/2
           -0.135 + 0.04652453655364597 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.04652453655364597
           -0.08847546344635403 <= x <= 0.08847546344635403
           
           The same range applies to y.
           
           I will generate placements that vary in x, y, and theta (primarily 0 and pi/4, as these are distinct for a square if considering a non-axis-aligned bounding box or corners).
           For theta = 0 or pi/2, the effective object extents are (0.093, 0.093).
           For theta = pi/4 or 3*pi/4, the effective bounding box would be larger. However, the problem statement provides object extents as AABB (0.093, 0.093), so I will assume the `size_x` and `size_y` given are for the object's local frame. When rotated, the AABB of the rotated object will be used for collision checking. For a square rotated by pi/4, the diagonal becomes the new effective side length for its AABB, which is sqrt(2) * 0.09304907310729194 / 2 * 2 = 0.13158.
           If theta is pi/4, the half-width/height of the *rotated* object's AABB for collision checking would be sqrt((0.093/2)^2 + (0.093/2)^2) = sqrt(2) * 0.093/2 = 0.06579.
           So the effective width for theta=pi/4 would be 2 * 0.06579 = 0.13158.
           
           New valid range for theta=pi/4:
           -0.135 + 0.06579 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.06579
           -0.06921 <= x <= 0.06921
           
           I will prioritize placements with theta=0 or pi/2 first, as they have a larger valid placement area. I will also try to cover the surface area.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene remains the same: a single square surface (0) from -0.135 to 0.135 in x and y.
           The new object (ID: 8) is also square, with side length 0.0979953484613062. This object is slightly larger than the previous one (ID: 4, size 0.093).
           
           I have a successful placement for object ID 4 at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). This means object 4 is at the center of surface 0.
           When placing object ID 8, I must avoid collision with object ID 4.
           The AABB of object 4 is centered at (0,0) with size_x = 0.09304907310729194, size_y = 0.09304907310729194.
           So object 4 occupies the region from approx. -0.0465 to 0.0465 in x and y.
           
           For object ID 8, with size_x = 0.0979953484613062 and size_y = 0.09799534846130621:
           If theta = 0, the half-width/height is 0.0979953484613062 / 2 = 0.0489976742306531.
           
           The valid range for object 8 (theta=0) without considering object 4 is:
           -0.135 + 0.0489976742306531 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.0489976742306531
           -0.0860023257693469 <= x <= 0.0860023257693469
           
           The region occupied by object 4 is [-0.0465, 0.0465] in x and y.
           To avoid collision, the new object (ID 8) must be placed such that its AABB does not overlap with object 4's AABB.
           
           If object 8 is placed with theta=0, its x-range is [center_x - 0.048997, center_x + 0.048997].
           If center_x + 0.048997 <= -0.0465, then no x-overlap. This means center_x <= -0.0465 - 0.048997 = -0.095497.
           If center_x - 0.048997 >= 0.0465, then no x-overlap. This means center_x >= 0.0465 + 0.048997 = 0.095497.
           
           However, the maximum x-coordinate is 0.086002. This means that if object 4 is at (0,0), it is impossible to place object 8 (with theta=0 or pi/2) without overlapping in the x-dimension, since 0.095497 is outside the valid range of x.
           Let's check the maximum possible x for object 8 (0.086002) and its extent.
           A placement at (0, 0.086002, 0.086002) would have x-range [0.086002-0.048997, 0.086002+0.048997] = [0.037, 0.135].
           This would collide with object 4's x-range [-0.0465, 0.0465] because 0.037 is within it.
           Similarly for y.
           
           This implies that if object 4 is at (0,0), object 8 cannot be placed on surface 0 without overlapping in the x or y dimension if theta=0 or pi/2.
           
           Let's re-evaluate. The condition for collision is if the intervals overlap.
           Interval A (obj 4 x-range): [-0.0465, 0.0465]
           Interval B (obj 8 x-range): [x - 0.048997, x + 0.048997]
           
           Overlap if (A_lower < B_upper) AND (A_upper > B_lower).
           Overlap if (-0.0465 < x + 0.048997) AND (0.0465 > x - 0.048997).
           This simplifies to:
           x > -0.0465 - 0.048997 = -0.095497
           x < 0.0465 + 0.048997 = 0.095497
           
           So, object 8's x-center must be outside (-0.095497, 0.095497) to avoid x-overlap with object 4.
           Similarly, its y-center must be outside (-0.095497, 0.095497) to avoid y-overlap with object 4.
           
           The total valid range for object 8's center on surface 0 is [-0.086002, 0.086002] for both x and y.
           Since -0.086002 > -0.095497 and 0.086002 < 0.095497, this means that *any* placement of object 8 with theta=0 or pi/2 will have either x-overlap or y-overlap (or both) with object 4, if object 4 is at (0,0) and also oriented at 0 or pi/2.
           
           Let's verify the `successes` format. It says (ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. This indicates surface_idx 0, theta 0.0, x 0.0, y 0.0. This confirms my assumption about object 4's placement.
           
           This is a critical observation. It suggests that if object 4 is at the center and the surface is not much larger than the objects, it may not be possible to place object 8 *at all* on surface 0 without collision, given its AABB and that of object 4.
           
           Let's re-check the object and surface dimensions precisely.
           Surface width = 0.135 - (-0.135) = 0.27
           Object 4 size = 0.09304907310729194
           Object 8 size = 0.0979953484613062
           
           Object 4 is centered at (0,0), with theta=0. Its AABB is [-0.0465245, 0.0465245] in x and y.
           For Object 8, let's try theta=0. Half-size = 0.04899767.
           Valid x_center range for object 8 on surface 0:
           x_min = -0.135 + 0.04899767 = -0.08600233
           x_max = 0.135 - 0.04899767 = 0.08600233
           
           To avoid collision with object 4 along x, object 8's AABB must be entirely to the left or right of object 4's AABB.
           Left: x_center + 0.04899767 <= -0.0465245 => x_center <= -0.0465245 - 0.04899767 = -0.09552217
           Right: x_center - 0.04899767 >= 0.0465245 => x_center >= 0.0465245 + 0.04899767 = 0.09552217
           
           Both -0.09552217 and 0.09552217 are outside the valid range for x_center of object 8 (-0.08600233 to 0.08600233).
           This means that with theta=0 (or pi/2), it is geometrically impossible to place object 8 on surface 0 without its x-AABB or y-AABB overlapping with object 4's AABB.
           
           This implies I must use a different orientation for object 8 such that its AABB is smaller, or that it somehow "fits" around object 4.
           For a square object, rotating it by pi/4 (0.785 radians) actually makes its *axis-aligned bounding box* larger.
           The diagonal of object 8 is sqrt(2) * 0.0979953484613062 = 0.138580.
           So, if theta = pi/4, the half-width/height of the AABB would be 0.138580 / 2 = 0.06929.
           Valid x_center range for object 8 on surface 0 with theta=pi/4:
           x_min = -0.135 + 0.06929 = -0.06571
           x_max = 0.135 - 0.06929 = 0.06571
           
           This range is even smaller than for theta=0, making collision avoidance even harder.
           
           So, the problem is that the object 4 is placed at the center, and object 8 is almost the same size. There isn't enough space around object 4 for object 8 to fit on surface 0.
           The total width of the surface is 0.27.
           Object 4 occupies 0.093049 in the middle.
           Remaining space on each side: (0.27 - 0.093049) / 2 = 0.176951 / 2 = 0.0884755.
           Object 8 needs a space of 0.097995.
           0.0884755 < 0.097995, so it cannot fit.
           
           Therefore, it is impossible to place object 8 on surface 0 without colliding with object 4, regardless of orientation, if object 4 is at (0,0) and the surface is a single, confined space.
           This is a scenario where I must logically conclude no valid placement exists. However, the instructions state "You never give up. No matter how many times you fail to provide a placement... you will always try to find a new placement."
           
           Given this constraint, I will provide placements that are *as far as possible* from object 4, even though they will logically lead to collision. The system will then reject them, and I will be able to learn from that failure. I will try to place it at the very edges of the valid surface region.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene remains the same: a single square surface (0) from -0.135 to 0.135 in x and y.
           The new object (ID: 5) is square, with side length 0.07265716165889059. This object is smaller than both object 4 (0.093) and object 8 (0.09799).
           
           I have two successful placements from previous requests that I must avoid colliding with:
           1. Object ID 4: (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) -> Surface 0, theta 0, x=0, y=0.
              AABB of object 4 (size 0.093049): x: [-0.0465245, 0.0465245], y: [-0.0465245, 0.0465245]
           
           2. Object ID 8: (0, 0.0, 0.0860023257693469, 0.0) -> Surface 0, theta 0, x=0.0860023, y=0.0.
              AABB of object 8 (size 0.097995): half-size = 0.04899767.
              x: [0.0860023 - 0.04899767, 0.0860023 + 0.04899767] = [0.0370046, 0.1350000]
              y: [-0.04899767, 0.04899767]
           
           So, the occupied regions on Surface 0 are:
           Obj 4: x in [-0.0465245, 0.0465245], y in [-0.0465245, 0.0465245]
           Obj 8: x in [0.0370046, 0.1350000], y in [-0.04899767, 0.04899767]
           
           Let's find the available space for object 5.
           Object 5 has size 0.07265716, half-size = 0.03632858.
           The valid x and y ranges for object 5 on surface 0, without considering other objects, are:
           x_center: [-0.135 + 0.03632858, 0.135 - 0.03632858] = [-0.09867142, 0.09867142]
           y_center: [-0.135 + 0.03632858, 0.135 - 0.03632858] = [-0.09867142, 0.09867142]
           
           Now, considering the occupied regions:
           The x-axis occupied segments are [-0.0465245, 0.0465245] by obj 4 and [0.0370046, 0.1350000] by obj 8.
           Notice that obj 8's x-range starts at 0.037, which overlaps with obj 4's x-range ending at 0.0465. This is slightly unexpected if the previous placement was truly stable, as it would imply collision between 4 and 8. Let's re-verify the input for obj 8.
           Obj 8 placement: (0, 0.0, 0.0860023257693469, 0.0)
           Obj 4 AABB: x [-0.0465245, 0.0465245]
           Obj 8 AABB (from center 0.0860023257693469, half-width 0.0489976742306531):
           x_min = 0.0860023257693469 - 0.0489976742306531 = 0.0370046515386938
           x_max = 0.0860023257693469 + 0.0489976742306531 = 0.135
           
           The success of obj 8's placement indicates that `0.0370046515386938` is *not* considered to collide with `0.0465245`. This implies that the collision detection has some tolerance, or it implicitly assumes an epsilon, or perhaps the AABB is for the minimum bounding box and the collision check considers the actual object geometry. Or, it could be that the problem implies that the given bounding boxes *are* the actual geometry.
           If `0.03700465` and `0.0465245` are the critical points, then there is an overlap.
           If AABB for object 4 is `[-0.0465245, 0.0465245]` and for object 8 is `[0.03700465, 0.135]`.
           These two intervals overlap, as `0.03700465 < 0.0465245`.
           This implies that either my understanding of collision or the provided "success" is inconsistent.
           However, I must work with the provided "successes". If the system says `(ID: 8) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0860023257693469, 0.0` is a success, then it implies that despite the AABB overlap, no collision occurred. This could be due to a slight safety margin in the collision checking or some other nuance not fully captured by simple AABB overlap.
           For now, I will assume the provided successes are literally non-colliding (even if their AABBs slightly touch/overlap based on my calculation).
           
           Let's proceed by finding available "gaps" for object 5.
           Effective occupied x-interval: `[-0.0465245, 0.135]` (union of [-0.0465245, 0.0465245] and [0.0370046, 0.135])
           Effective occupied y-interval: `[-0.04899767, 0.04899767]` (union of [-0.0465245, 0.0465245] and [-0.04899767, 0.04899767])
           
           So, effectively, the center strip `x in [-0.0465245, 0.135]` and `y in [-0.04899767, 0.04899767]` is mostly occupied.
           This means I should look for placements where:
           1. x is outside `[-0.0465245 - obj5_half_size, 0.135 + obj5_half_size]`
              x is outside `[-0.0465245 - 0.03632858, 0.135 + 0.03632858]` = `[-0.082853, 0.171328]`
              The valid x range for obj 5 is `[-0.09867142, 0.09867142]`.
              So, valid non-colliding x would be `[-0.09867142, -0.082853]` or `[0.171328, 0.09867142]` (this interval is empty).
              This indicates that for collision avoidance along X, the object must be entirely to the left of x = -0.0465245.
              x_center + 0.03632858 <= -0.0465245 => x_center <= -0.0465245 - 0.03632858 = -0.08285308.
              So, the x-center for object 5 must be in `[-0.09867142, -0.08285308]`.
              
           2. y is outside `[-0.04899767 - obj5_half_size, 0.04899767 + obj5_half_size]`
              y is outside `[-0.04899767 - 0.03632858, 0.04899767 + 0.03632858]` = `[-0.08532625, 0.08532625]`
              The valid y range for obj 5 is `[-0.09867142, 0.09867142]`.
              So, valid non-colliding y would be `[-0.09867142, -0.08532625]` or `[0.08532625, 0.09867142]`.
           
           So, potential regions for object 5's center (theta=0):
           Region 1: x in `[-0.09867142, -0.08285308]`, y in `[-0.09867142, 0.09867142]` (this allows vertical movement, effectively to the left of all other objects' x-extents).
           Region 2: x in `[-0.09867142, 0.09867142]`, y in `[-0.09867142, -0.08532625]` or `[0.08532625, 0.09867142]` (this allows horizontal movement above or below existing objects' y-extents).
           
           Let's focus on Region 1 and Region 2 with distinct x and y coordinates.
           For Region 1, I can pick x = -0.09.
           Then y can be anything within `[-0.09867, 0.09867]`.
           Example: (-0.09, 0.0), (-0.09, 0.09), (-0.09, -0.09)
           
           For Region 2 (top): I can pick y = 0.09.
           Then x can be anything within `[-0.09867, 0.09867]`. However, I still need to avoid obj4/obj8 x-overlaps.
           The combined X-AABB occupied by objects 4 and 8 is roughly [-0.0465, 0.135].
           To avoid this, obj5_center_x + obj5_half_size <= -0.0465 (x_center <= -0.0828)
           OR obj5_center_x - obj5_half_size >= 0.135 (x_center >= 0.1713 -- outside of surface 0 x-range)
           
           This means if y is outside the main occupied band `[-0.0853, 0.0853]`, then x for object 5 must still satisfy `x_center <= -0.0828` or `x_center >= 0.1713`.
           This is still very restrictive.
           So, the actual regions are more limited for x.
           
           If y is in `[0.08532625, 0.09867142]`:
           Then x must be `[-0.09867142, -0.08285308]` to avoid obj 4 and 8 in the x-dimension.
           Let's pick (x=-0.09, y=0.09).
           Or x could be to the right of 0.135, which is impossible.
           So the only truly free area is the top-left corner or bottom-left corner of the surface.
           
           Let's try to place it in the top-left corner:
           x_center = -0.09867142
           y_center = 0.09867142
           This point satisfies the condition for object 5 to be within surface 0 bounds.
           x_center + 0.03632858 = -0.09867142 + 0.03632858 = -0.06234284. This is greater than -0.08285308. So the AABB will not be completely to the left of obj4/8.
           My reasoning for collision avoidance must be correct, so there is still a slight possibility of an issue if strict AABB collision is enforced by the system.
           Let's recheck the logic for x-collision.
           Obj5 AABB: [x_c - h, x_c + h]
           No collision with Obj4/8 if:
           (x_c + h <= -0.0465245) OR (x_c - h >= 0.135)
           x_c <= -0.0465245 - 0.03632858 = -0.08285308 (valid x range -0.098 to 0.098, so [-0.0986, -0.0828] is possible)
           OR x_c >= 0.135 + 0.03632858 = 0.17132858 (not possible as max x_c is 0.0986)
           
           So for x, `x_center` must be in `[-0.09867142, -0.08285308]`.
           
           Similarly for y:
           No collision with Obj4/8 if:
           (y_c + h <= -0.04899767) OR (y_c - h >= 0.04899767)
           y_c <= -0.04899767 - 0.03632858 = -0.08532625 (valid y range -0.098 to 0.098, so [-0.0986, -0.0853] is possible)
           OR y_c >= 0.04899767 + 0.03632858 = 0.08532625 (valid y range -0.098 to 0.098, so [0.0853, 0.0986] is possible)
           
           So, possible placements for the center (x_c, y_c) are:
           1. x_c in `[-0.09867142, -0.08285308]` and y_c in `[-0.09867142, 0.09867142]`.
              For example, x_c = -0.09. Then y_c can be anywhere.
              (-0.09, 0.0)
              (-0.09, 0.09)
              (-0.09, -0.09)
           
           2. x_c in `[-0.09867142, 0.09867142]` and y_c in `[-0.09867142, -0.08532625]` OR `[0.08532625, 0.09867142]`.
              Combined with the x-constraint, this means:
              x_c in `[-0.09867142, -0.08285308]` AND y_c in `[-0.09867142, -0.08532625]` (bottom-left corner)
              x_c in `[-0.09867142, -0.08285308]` AND y_c in `[0.08532625, 0.09867142]` (top-left corner)
           
           It appears there are small pockets in the top-left and bottom-left for object 5 to fit.
           Let's try to fill these small regions, and then generate more placements that might be slightly out of these regions to see if the system has a larger tolerance.
           
           Let's pick x_c = -0.09 and y_c = 0.09 for a top-left placement.
           (0, 0.0, -0.09, 0.09)
           (0, 0.0, -0.09, -0.09)
           (0, 0.0, -0.098, 0.098) # Extreme top-left
           (0, 0.0, -0.098, -0.098) # Extreme bottom-left
           
           I will try other placements that are within the allowed overall bounds of surface 0, but might slightly overlap with existing objects given my strict AABB reasoning, as the previous successful placement of object 8 suggests some tolerance.
           Placements:
           (0, 0.0, -0.09, 0.09)
           (0, 0.0, -0.09, -0.09)

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene is still a single square surface (0) from -0.135 to 0.135 in x and y.
           The new object (ID: 7) is square, with side length 0.09078036959048119. This is similar in size to object 4 (0.093) and object 8 (0.09799), and slightly larger than object 5 (0.0726).
           
           I have three successful placements from previous requests that I must avoid colliding with:
           1. Object ID 4: (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) -> Surface 0, theta 0, x=0, y=0.
              AABB of object 4 (size 0.093049): x: [-0.0465245, 0.0465245], y: [-0.0465245, 0.0465245]
           
           2. Object ID 8: (0, 0.0, 0.0860023257693469, 0.0) -> Surface 0, theta 0, x=0.0860023, y=0.0.
              AABB of object 8 (size 0.097995): half-size = 0.04899767.
              x: [0.0860023 - 0.04899767, 0.0860023 + 0.04899767] = [0.0370046, 0.1350000]
              y: [-0.04899767, 0.04899767]
           
           3. Object ID 5: (0, 0.0, -0.09, 0.09) -> Surface 0, theta 0, x=-0.09, y=0.09.
              AABB of object 5 (size 0.072657): half-size = 0.03632858.
              x: [-0.09 - 0.03632858, -0.09 + 0.03632858] = [-0.12632858, -0.05367142]
              y: [0.09 - 0.03632858, 0.09 + 0.03632858] = [0.05367142, 0.12632858]
           
           Let's summarize the occupied regions (AABBs):
           Obj 4: X in [-0.0465, 0.0465], Y in [-0.0465, 0.0465]
           Obj 8: X in [0.0370, 0.1350], Y in [-0.0490, 0.0490]
           Obj 5: X in [-0.1263, -0.0537], Y in [0.0537, 0.1263]
           
           Combined X-occupied segments: `[-0.1263, -0.0537] U [-0.0465, 0.0465] U [0.0370, 0.1350]`
           Combined Y-occupied segments: `[-0.0490, 0.0490] U [0.0537, 0.1263]`
           
           Object 7 has size 0.09078036959048119, half-size = 0.04539018479524059.
           The valid x and y ranges for object 7 on surface 0, without considering other objects, are:
           x_center: [-0.135 + 0.04539018, 0.135 - 0.04539018] = [-0.08960982, 0.08960982]
           y_center: [-0.135 + 0.04539018, 0.135 - 0.04539018] = [-0.08960982, 0.08960982]
           
           Now, let's find non-colliding regions for object 7.
           For X-axis:
           No collision if `obj7_x_center + 0.04539 <= lower_bound_of_gap` OR `obj7_x_center - 0.04539 >= upper_bound_of_gap`.
           The occupied X-space spans roughly from -0.1263 to 0.135.
           The "gap" between obj5 and obj4/8 is very small: from -0.0537 to -0.0465. This is a gap of 0.0072. Object 7 needs 0.09078. It cannot fit there.
           So, to avoid X-collision, object 7's AABB must be:
           1. Entirely to the left of Obj5: `x_c + 0.04539 <= -0.1263` => `x_c <= -0.1263 - 0.04539 = -0.17169`. This is outside the surface x-range.
           2. Entirely to the right of Obj4/8: `x_c - 0.04539 >= 0.135` (the rightmost point of obj8) => `x_c >= 0.135 + 0.04539 = 0.18039`. This is outside the surface x-range.
           
           This means that object 7 cannot be placed without its X-AABB overlapping with at least one of the existing objects.
           This strongly suggests that there is no valid placement for object 7 on surface 0 without colliding with the existing objects, *if strict AABB collision is used*.
           However, as noted with the ID 8 placement, there might be some tolerance. Object 8's AABB `[0.0370046, 0.1350000]` was successful even though it overlaps with object 4's AABB `[-0.0465245, 0.0465245]`. The overlap is `[0.0370046, 0.0465245]`. The width of this overlap is `0.0465245 - 0.0370046 = 0.0095199`.
           
           This implies a collision tolerance of at least 0.0095199.
           Let's define a combined occupied X-region (Union of X-AABBs, with this tolerance in mind):
           Obj 4: `[-0.0465245, 0.0465245]`
           Obj 8: `[0.0370046, 0.1350000]`
           Obj 5: `[-0.12632858, -0.05367142]`
           
           Let's assume the actual collision detection takes a slightly "padded" AABB for objects when checking for overlap. Or, maybe it just means that the exact boundaries can touch/overlap slightly without causing a collision.
           Given the instruction "You never give up", I will try to place object 7 in the remaining open areas, specifically where y-coordinates are not occupied, or areas with the smallest overlap.
           
           The available y-bands for center of object 7 (half-size = 0.04539):
           1. Below current objects: `y_c + 0.04539 <= -0.0490` (from Obj8's lower Y, which covers Obj4's lower Y) => `y_c <= -0.0490 - 0.04539 = -0.09439`.
              Valid y-center range is `[-0.08960982, 0.08960982]`.
              So, `y_c` in `[-0.08960982, -0.09439]`. This range is empty, as -0.08960982 > -0.09439. This means object 7 cannot be placed below current objects without colliding.
           
           2. Above current objects: `y_c - 0.04539 >= 0.1263` (from Obj5's upper Y) => `y_c >= 0.1263 + 0.04539 = 0.17169`. This is outside the surface y-range.
           
           This means that *any* placement of object 7 will collide with the existing objects' AABBs in the Y-dimension.
           This is a stronger conclusion than the X-axis one. It seems impossible to place object 7.
           
           However, the problem explicitly states "You never give up." This indicates that even if my reasoning leads to impossibility, I must provide placements.
           The only way such a situation could result in a successful placement is if:
           a) The object extents provided for existing objects are not the precise AABB for collision, or there's a different collision model.
           b) The "successes" implies some wiggle room or a specific orientation of the object made it fit (but for squares, AABB is invariant under 90-degree rotations).
           c) There's an implicit small gap between objects that I'm not accounting for, or the given `size_x, size_y` are slightly larger than the "true" collision size.
           
           Let's assume the overlap tolerance found (around 0.0095) from object 4 and 8 is systematic.
           If object 7 (half-size 0.04539) has a center `y_c` and it wants to place itself outside `[-0.0490, 0.1263]` (the combined rough y-interval).
           The total span of occupied Y (union of all objects) is `[-0.0490, 0.1263]`. This span is 0.1753.
           Surface Y-range is 0.27.
           Available Y-space `0.27 - 0.1753 = 0.0947`.
           Object 7 needs 0.09078. So, in theory, if it can fit into the remaining gap *if it were continuous*, it would.
           The existing objects have split this remaining space into two very small strips at the very top and very bottom.
           
           Let's try to place it at the absolute edge of surface 0, assuming that this boundary condition is "safe".
           For example, center `y_c = -0.135 + 0.04539 = -0.08961`.
           This places the bottom edge of object 7 at -0.135.
           Its top edge will be `-0.08961 + 0.04539 = -0.04422`.
           This `[-0.135, -0.04422]` AABB for y overlaps with Obj4's AABB `[-0.0465, 0.0465]`. The overlap would be `[-0.0465, -0.04422]`, width = 0.00228. This is smaller than the 0.0095 overlap seen before, so maybe this will work?
           
           Let's try to place it at the very bottom edge of the surface, as far away from the Y-occupancy as possible, and for X, let's try the only available X-region (left side of surface).
           The X-range available is `[-0.0896, -0.0537 - 0.04539]` for its right side to not overlap with Obj5.
           `x_c - 0.04539 >= -0.135` => `x_c >= -0.08961`
           `x_c + 0.04539 <= -0.0537` => `x_c <= -0.0537 - 0.04539 = -0.09909`
           So valid x range for center of obj7 for its right edge to be left of obj5: `[-0.08961, -0.09909]`. This range is empty.
           This also confirms x-collision will happen.
           
           I will try to place object 7 in the regions that are "least overlapping" or are at the extreme valid coordinates for the surface itself. This will primarily involve placing it to the extreme left/right and top/bottom of the available surface, at coordinates that satisfy the object's self-containment on surface 0, but will likely lead to collision with the previously placed objects.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene is still a single square surface (0) from -0.135 to 0.135 in x and y.
           The new object (ID: 6) is square, with side length 0.09561794986202904. This size is between object 4 (0.093) and object 8 (0.09799). It is larger than object 5 (0.0726) and object 7 (0.09078).
           
           I now have four successful placements from previous requests that I must avoid colliding with:
           1. Object ID 4: (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) -> Surface 0, theta 0, x=0, y=0.
              AABB of object 4 (size 0.093049): x: [-0.0465245, 0.0465245], y: [-0.0465245, 0.0465245]
           
           2. Object ID 8: (0, 0.0, 0.0860023257693469, 0.0) -> Surface 0, theta 0, x=0.0860023, y=0.0.
              AABB of object 8 (size 0.097995): half-size = 0.04899767.
              x: [0.0860023 - 0.04899767, 0.0860023 + 0.04899767] = [0.0370046, 0.1350000]
              y: [-0.04899767, 0.04899767]
           
           3. Object ID 5: (0, 0.0, -0.09, 0.09) -> Surface 0, theta 0, x=-0.09, y=0.09.
              AABB of object 5 (size 0.072657): half-size = 0.03632858.
              x: [-0.09 - 0.03632858, -0.09 + 0.03632858] = [-0.12632858, -0.05367142]
              y: [0.09 - 0.03632858, 0.09 + 0.03632858] = [0.05367142, 0.12632858]
           
           4. Object ID 7: (0, 1.5707963267948966, -0.08960982, -0.08960982) -> Surface 0, theta pi/2, x=-0.08960982, y=-0.08960982.
              AABB of object 7 (size 0.090780): half-size = 0.04539018. Since theta = pi/2, the orientation of its bounding box remains the same, so the AABB extents are still `size_x/2` and `size_y/2` from the center.
              x: [-0.08960982 - 0.04539018, -0.08960982 + 0.04539018] = [-0.1350000, -0.04421964]
              y: [-0.08960982 - 0.04539018, -0.08960982 + 0.04539018] = [-0.1350000, -0.04421964]
           
           Let's consolidate the occupied X and Y AABB regions (union of all object AABBs):
           X-occupied:
           Obj 4: [-0.0465, 0.0465]
           Obj 8: [0.0370, 0.1350]
           Obj 5: [-0.1263, -0.0537]
           Obj 7: [-0.1350, -0.0442]
           
           Union for X: `[-0.1350, -0.0442] U [-0.0465, 0.0465] U [0.0370, 0.1350]`
           Note: The gaps here are extremely narrow. For example, between `[-0.0442]` and `[-0.0465]`, there's no space. `[-0.0465, 0.0465]` and `[0.0370, 0.1350]` still overlap, as previously observed.
           So effectively, the X-axis is almost entirely covered from -0.135 to 0.135.
           Combined X-range `[-0.135, 0.135]`.
           This means there is practically no 'free' space along the X-axis for a new object without overlapping one of the existing objects, unless there's an extremely narrow gap that the collision detection tolerates.
           The largest continuous occupied region for X is `[-0.135, 0.135]` based on union.
           
           Y-occupied:
           Obj 4: [-0.0465, 0.0465]
           Obj 8: [-0.0490, 0.0490]
           Obj 5: [0.0537, 0.1263]
           Obj 7: [-0.1350, -0.0442]
           
           Union for Y: `[-0.1350, -0.0442] U [-0.0490, 0.0490] U [0.0537, 0.1263]`
           Similarly, the Y-axis is almost entirely covered.
           The Y range from `[-0.0442]` to `[-0.0490]` has no space.
           The Y range from `[0.0490]` to `[0.0537]` has a small gap of `0.0537 - 0.0490 = 0.0047`.
           This is a very small gap.
           
           Object 6 has size 0.09561794986202904, half-size = 0.04780897493101452.
           The valid x and y ranges for object 6 on surface 0, without considering other objects, are:
           x_center: [-0.135 + 0.04780897, 0.135 - 0.04780897] = [-0.08719103, 0.08719103]
           y_center: [-0.135 + 0.04780897, 0.135 - 0.04780897] = [-0.08719103, 0.08719103]
           
           From my analysis, it seems virtually impossible to place object 6 without AABB collision. The surface is almost completely filled by the existing objects.
           The `0.0047` gap in Y (between `0.0490` and `0.0537`) is much smaller than object 6's required dimension (0.0956). So object 6 cannot fit into this gap.
           
           Given the strict "never give up" rule, I must provide placements. I will once again focus on positions that are at the extreme valid range for object 6 on surface 0, or attempt to utilize any minute gaps, knowing they might logically fail based on AABB. The previous successes with slight AABB overlaps suggest that "touching" might be allowed or there's a tolerance. The overlap between Obj4 and Obj8 was ~0.0095. The gap between Obj4/8 and Obj5 in Y is 0.0047. This is less than the observed tolerance.
           
           I will try to place Object 6 slightly outside the "effective" union of existing AABBs.
           For example, placing it so its AABB slightly overlaps with the existing objects, similar to how Object 8 successfully did.
           
           Let's try to place it in the center, or near the center, and rotate it. A square rotated by pi/4 has a larger AABB. But since `size_x` and `size_y` are for the AABB, for a square, `size_x` and `size_y` are the same, and rotation by `pi/2` has no effect on AABB. Rotation by `pi/4` will expand the AABB to `sqrt(2) * size_x / 2 * 2 = sqrt(2) * size_x`.
           Half-size for rotated object 6 would be `sqrt(2) * 0.09561794986202904 / 2 = 0.06760`.
           This would reduce the available space on the surface even further.
           `x_center: [-0.135 + 0.06760, 0.135 - 0.06760] = [-0.0674, 0.0674]`. This is smaller than `[-0.087, 0.087]`.
           
           So, the only strategy is to keep trying different extreme positions (with theta=0 or pi/2) within the overall surface, even if they appear to collide.
