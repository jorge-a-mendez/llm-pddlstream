           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable objects: v8, v12, and v14. They are currently on surface v11, as indicated by `supported` and `atpose` predicates. The goal is to place all three objects on surface v16. This will require picking each object from its current pose and placing it on a new pose on surface v16. The robot arm v4 is available and handempty. The base is at configuration v3. There are several `kin` facts indicating that the robot can pick up and place all three objects. I will use the `move_base` action if the base needs to be moved. The #o2 pose is designated as the target pose on surface v16 for all three objects. I will first pick up v8, then v12, then v14 and place them sequentially.

           Pose #o2 = (-0.1 0.0 0.781 0.0) for object v14 on surface v16 is not stable, as the 2D AABB of the object (AABB(lower=(-0.13500000149011612, -0.035), upper=(-0.06500000149011612, 0.035))) is not contained in the 2D AABB of the surface (AABB(lower=(-0.135, -0.135), upper=(0.135, 0.135))). Make sure your poses are in the format `(<x> <y> <z> <theta>)`.
           Please provide a plan and poses that achieves the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all poses are valid and stable.

Model:     The previous attempt failed due to unstable placements of objects v12 and v14 on surface v16. I need to ensure that the 2D AABB of the object is contained within the 2D AABB of the surface.
           
           Object v8 has AABB ((-0.115, 0.411), (-0.031, 0.495))
           Object v12 has AABB ((0.142, -0.301), (0.224, -0.218))
           Object v14 has AABB ((-0.241, -0.586), (-0.143, -0.488))
           Surface v16 has AABB ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))
           
           Let's adjust the x and y coordinates of the poses to ensure they are within the bounds of surface v16. The z-coordinate remains 0.781 (which is the tabletop height) and theta remains 0.0 for simplicity.
           
           For v8 (AABB = ((-0.115, 0.411), (-0.031, 0.495))): This object seems to have a y-coordinate that's too large to fit on v16 without rotation.
           Let's reconsider the bounding box interpretation. The provided bounding boxes are for the object in its local frame. When placed, they are centered at the pose x, y. The surface v16 is centered at (0,0). So to place them on v16, their x,y coordinates must be close to (0,0) and the dimensions must fit within v16.
           The AABB of v16 is from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           
           Re-evaluating the object AABBs given that the object's local AABB is provided. The values provided are `((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))`. For the purpose of fitting it onto a surface centered at (0,0), we need to ensure that the extent of the object in its local frame (i.e. maxx - minx and maxy - miny) fits within the surface, and that the pose places the object within the surface.
           
           The provided AABBs for objects are likely relative to some default pose. Let's assume the origin of the object is the center of its bounding box.
           For v8: width = 0.495 - 0.411 = 0.084, height = -0.031 - (-0.115) = 0.084. Max dimension 0.084. This can fit on v16 (0.27 x 0.27).
           For v12: width = 0.224 - 0.142 = 0.082, height = -0.218 - (-0.301) = 0.083. Max dimension 0.083. This can fit.
           For v14: width = -0.143 - (-0.241) = 0.098, height = -0.488 - (-0.586) = 0.098. Max dimension 0.098. This can fit.
           
           All objects have similar dimensions, around 0.1m. The surface v16 has a side length of 0.27m. So they can all fit, as long as the x,y coordinates for the #o2 pose keep the objects centered on the surface.
           
           I'll place them at different x, y coordinates on the surface v16, making sure they are separated and within the bounds. Let's try:
           v8: (0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           v12: (0.05, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           v14: (-0.05, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           
           Let's be careful about the AABB given for the objects, which seems to imply their global position rather than just their extent. If the AABB provided is for the object in its current `atpose` state, it means the object *already* has a certain extent in the world. However, the problem statement says "Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6))" - and v11 is a surface, not a specific pose of an object. This implies the AABBs are about the object *itself*, not its current pose.
           
           Given the previous error message explicitly mentioning `AABB(lower=(0.06500000149011612, -0.035), upper=(0.13500000149011612, 0.035))` for v12 with a pose of (0.1, 0.0, ...), it seems that the object's AABB is implicitly shifted by its pose. So if an object has an AABB of `((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))` *relative to its center*, and the pose is `(px, py, pz, p_theta)`, then the global AABB (in 2D) would be `((px + minx_rot, py + miny_rot), (px + maxx_rot, py + maxy_rot))`. For simplicity, if theta is 0, then the object spans from `px+minx` to `px+maxx` in x, and `py+miny` to `py+maxy` in y.
           
           Let's assume the AABBs for v8, v12, v14 are their extent *when centered at (0,0)*.
           v8: width 0.084, height 0.084.
           v12: width 0.082, height 0.083.
           v14: width 0.098, height 0.098.
           Surface v16: from -0.135 to 0.135.
           
           I will try placing them symmetrically around the center of v16 to allow for three objects to be placed.
           
           v8: at (0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           v12: at (0.0, 0.06, 0.781, 0.0)
           v14: at (0.0, -0.06, 0.781, 0.0)
           
           The half-width/height for v8 is 0.042. So its x range would be (0.0-0.042, 0.0+0.042) = (-0.042, 0.042) which is within (-0.135, 0.135). Same for y.
           For v12, half-width/height is approx 0.041. At (0.0, 0.06), its x range is (-0.041, 0.041) (within bounds). Its y range is (0.06-0.041, 0.06+0.041) = (0.019, 0.101) (within bounds).
           For v14, half-width/height is approx 0.049. At (0.0, -0.06), its x range is (-0.049, 0.049) (within bounds). Its y range is (-0.06-0.049, -0.06+0.049) = (-0.109, -0.011) (within bounds).
           All these placements are stable.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', v35) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The error message "Precondition fact ('atbconf', v35) is not satisfied!" indicates that the `move_base` action or the `pick`/`place` actions which require an `atbconf` predicate are using a base configuration `v35` that is not the current base configuration. In the initial state, `atbconf(v3)` is true. The available `kin` facts for `pick` and `place` actions all use `#o3` as the base configuration. This means the robot needs to move its base to `#o3` before picking or placing. However, there are also `basemotion` facts for moving between `v3` and `#o3` using `#o0` as a trajectory.
           
           The previous plan did not include a `move_base` action. I need to insert a `move_base` action to move the robot from `v3` to `#o3` before the first `pick` action. Since all `kin` actions use the same base configuration `#o3`, one `move_base` action at the beginning should suffice. The `canmove()` predicate will be set to false after `move_base` and then to true after `pick`/`place`, which is consistent.
