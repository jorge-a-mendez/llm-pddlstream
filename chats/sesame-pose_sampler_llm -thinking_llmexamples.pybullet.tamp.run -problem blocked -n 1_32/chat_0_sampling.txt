(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to determine 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, dimensions 0.07 x 0.07) on a defined surface (surface 0, bounding box: (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0)). I've defined a placement as a tuple of (surface index, rotation angle, x-coordinate, y-coordinate), where the angle is in radians and (x, y) specifies the object's center.
           
           Since the object's width and height are so similar and small compared to the surface (0.6 x 0.6), I anticipate a high degree of placement flexibility.  My approach focuses on analyzing how the object's bounding box changes with rotation and how that influences placement within the surface's boundaries.
           
           The core of my thought process revolves around calculating the object's effective bounding box (rotated AABB) dimensions for any given rotation. The object is close to a square, which implies that the bounding box will change slightly depending on the angle of rotation, especially when the angle is changed slightly around multiples of π/2.  I use the formulas `rotated_w = w * |cos(theta)| + h * |sin(theta)|` and `rotated_h = w * |sin(theta)| + h * |cos(theta)|` to determine these effective dimensions.
           
           I've decided to test five angles: 0, π/8, π/4, 3π/8, and π/2. Because of symmetry and the shape of the object, these five angles should provide the variation required. For each angle I will consider two (x,y) pairs for good coverage of the area. For `x` and `y` I will use range calculations and then select values based on what will lead to a good result. I'll make sure each placement is calculated and then returned, which gives me 50 placements as needed.
           
           My strategy involves systematically varying rotation and sampling x-y coordinates within the boundaries to make sure the object's bounding box is fully contained within the surface's AABB. I've designed a systematic means of calculating the proper offsets to make sure that the object is not over-positioned.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **My current focus is on placing a new object (ID: 10) onto a surface, ensuring it doesn't collide with existing, successfully placed objects (ID: 5).**  I know the successful placements of ID: 5; their positions are effectively "off-limits" for ID: 10. The key to this is AABB collision checking.
           
           I've determined the AABBs for the objects with ID: 5. I calculated the precise AABBs, including edge lengths, half-width, and half-heights. They're all placed at theta = 0, so their bounding boxes are simple rectangles.  These AABBs are crucial for defining the "no-go" zones on the surface.
           
           The surface is defined and I've quickly calculated the available width and height.
           
           Object ID: 10 is almost a square. The object will be rotated in increments of pi/8. I considered each rotation to find the largest effective bounding box for ID:10 (at 45 degrees, which is pi/4). Because of ID:5's placement, most of the surface is blocked by the left and right ID:5 AABBs.
           
           The clear placement area for ID:10 is in a vertical strip between the two columns of existing ID: 5 objects. Since this strip is clear, I know I must place all 50 objects for ID:10 within it. Then, for each of the five angles, I chose two x-values and five y-values within that central range.
           
           The algorithm calculates the `rotated_w` and `rotated_h` for each rotation. Then, it uses the rotated dimensions, the surface boundaries and the `ID:5` AABBs to calculate the valid placement ranges for the center of the `ID: 10` object. The `x` range will be between the two columns of `ID: 5`, and the valid `y` range is calculated from the surface. In other words, to avoid collisions with the existing `ID: 5` objects, any rotations of `ID: 10` must be located inside the calculated surface range.
