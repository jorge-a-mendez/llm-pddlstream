User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Final Thoughts and Strategy for Robot Base Placement**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out three good spots for my robot base relative to a target point, making sure they're within two units of that target. The robot has to face the target, so the orientation is handled. I also need to dodge all the fixed obstacles in the environment, which are described by a bunch of AABBs (axis-aligned bounding boxes). The robot's limited to movement between -2.5 and 2.5 on both the x and y axes.
           
           My target is at (-1.65, 0.7).
           
           I started by looking at all the obstacles and figuring out which ones are most important to avoid. I made a list of the AABBs and noticed that the outer walls are technically obstacles, but they define the space I'm allowed to work in. There's a vertical wall at x=0 that's potentially problematic.
           
           To find valid positions, I made sure they're within two units of the target, and within the global bounds. I defined a simple function to check if a point is colliding with any AABB and another to check if the line between a candidate position and the target intersects any AABBs.
           
           Given the nature of the problem, I decided to first generate some diverse candidate points and then refine them based on collisions and line-of-sight. The target's in the second quadrant, and I started with some initial guesses, like points to the left, right, above, and below the target. I found good positions:
           
           *   **P1 = (-2.5, 0.7)**:  This is directly to the left of the target, and passes all checks.
           *   **P3 = (-1.65, 2.5)**: This point is directly above the target, and is also good.
           *   **P6 = (-2.0, 0.0)**: This point is towards the bottom left, and it's good too.
           
           I carefully checked the line of sight for each point against the obstacles. All selected positions satisfy all criteria. They're all close to the target, within the world boundaries, and unobstructed. These points are different enough from each other to offer different visual perspectives on the target.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Analyzing and Planning for a New Target**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a new target point: `(0.1, 0.5)`. Time to apply the lessons learned from the previous failed attempts. First, I need to make sure I *avoid* the walls that are defined as obstacles, specifically ensuring the robot base does not touch the edges of the room at `x = -2.5`, `x = 2.5`, `y = -2.5`, and `y = 2.5`.  I'll play it safe and stay within `(-2.4, 2.4)` for both x and y.
           
           The maximum range is 2, meaning I can position the base anywhere within a circle of radius 2 centered around the target. This gives me a search area. However, there's also that pesky central vertical wall at `x = 0`. Since the target is to the right of this wall, I need the base to also be to the right of it to have a clear line of sight. So, my x values for potential base positions must be greater than 0.05.
           
           Combining these factors, I'll search for positions within the x-range `[0.06, 2.1]` and the y-range `[-1.5, 2.4]`.
           
           With these constraints, it's time to check which obstacles will get in the way. After some checking, I've got to ensure the positions don't intersect the following obstacles:
           
           *   Top-right obstacles - obstacle 7, obstacle 9 and obstacle 19.
           *   Bottom-right obstacles - obstacle 13 and obstacle 15.
           
           So, I'll choose these positions and make sure they meet all the conditions.
           
           1.  **Position 1: (2.1, 0.5)** This point is at the maximum range of 2 from the target and is directly to the right. It doesn't collide with the obstacles, and the line of sight (a horizontal line) is clear of any obstructions.
           2.  **Position 2: (0.5, -1.0)** - This position is down and slightly to the right. It's close enough to target. The segment joining the positions has clear line of sight, with no intersections.
           3.  **Position 3: (1.0, 1.0)** - Above and right of the target, this position also does not collide, and offers a clear line of sight.
           
           Based on this revised analysis and taking all precautions, these 3 positions should work.
