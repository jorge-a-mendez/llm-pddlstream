User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is mostly enclosed by walls at x, y = +/- 2.5, with an additional wall segment at y=0. The target is at (0.91 0.49). I will try to place the robot in a variety of directions around the target within the allowed range and avoiding the obstacles. I will prioritize positions that give a good view of the target.
           
           Positions:
           (1.91 0.49)
           (0.91 2.49)
           (-0.09 0.49)
