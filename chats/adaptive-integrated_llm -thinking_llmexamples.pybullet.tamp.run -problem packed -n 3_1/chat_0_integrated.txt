User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.159, 0.428, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.41, 0.912).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.208, 0.378), (-0.109, 0.477)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.223, 0.218, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.766, 0.642).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.182, 0.177), (0.264, 0.258)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.222, -0.272, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.848, 0.529).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.175, -0.319), (0.268, -0.225)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom canmove()
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom atpose(v14, v15)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom stackable(v14, v16)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom supported(v14, v15, v11)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)
           Atom stackable(v14, v10)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of Achieving the Goal**
           
           Okay, I've got the objective clearly in mind: to get v8, v12, and v14 all stacked on top of v16. Simple enough in concept, but let's dive into the practicalities of the plan. I see that currently, each of these objects (v8, v12, and v14) is supported by v11, resting at specific poses.
           
           However, the only action I'm allowed to use is `move_base`. Given my expertise, I instantly recognize this as a critical limitation. To achieve this stacking, I'd need to manipulate objects - that means I need to *pick* them up and *place* them down. It's the only way to relocate these objects from their current supported positions on `v11` to the desired target, `v16`.
           
           Let's do a quick reality check on the available actions. There are no `pick` or `place` action instances provided. The constraint is clear: I'm restricted to just moving the base.
           
           Given the constraints of *move_base* only and the fundamental need to pick and place objects to achieve the goal, I must conclude that the task is currently unreachable. The provided action set is fundamentally incompatible with the desired outcome.
