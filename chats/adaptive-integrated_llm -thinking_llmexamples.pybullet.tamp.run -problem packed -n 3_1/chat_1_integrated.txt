User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.208, 0.378), (-0.109, 0.477)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.182, 0.177), (0.264, 0.258)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.222, -0.272, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.848, 0.529).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.159, 0.428, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.41, 0.912).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.223, 0.218, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.766, 0.642).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.175, -0.319), (0.268, -0.225)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Assessment**
           
           Okay, here's what I've concluded after going through the process. The core of the problem lies in the geometric constraints: I'm trying to place three oddly-shaped objects on a surface, `v16`, that's just not big enough to accommodate them without some overlap, no matter how I arrange them.
           
           My goal is to position objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto surface `v16` (to achieve goals like `on(v8, v16)`). The initial state of each object at the location of `v11`, a surface. To achieve the goals, a pick and place sequence. The base is not moving, so I won't create and use the `move_base` action. Now for continuous values for pose objects `(#o2)`, which describes a new pose on surface `v16`. Since all the object's goals depend on `#o2`, I must define the specific pose location for each individual object. But there's a problem: I can't find placements that will satisfy all the constraints. The provided information includes Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for each object. For the purpose of the plan, I would have used them to check for collisions, and I needed to find positions for each item such that they don't overlap. Since the AABB is supposed to represent the maximum extents, these constraints mean a geometric impossibility. So, it's impossible to generate a plan that guarantees all objects will be both stable and collision-free. I spent a lot of time trying to come up with possible configurations. I tried to do it by aligning them in different arrangements, and even considering a layout, however, none of these strategies resulted in a collision-free configuration. After considering the given object AABBs for the space they cover, I've concluded that it's impossible. Because the geometry just doesn't allow it. It's a fundamental physical constraint that cannot be overcome.
