           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Thoughts and Strategy**
           
           My primary objective is to develop a plan that fulfills the goal `new-axiom@0()`. To achieve this, I'll need to break down the goal into its core components and devise a step-by-step strategy. This includes ensuring all three image objectives (v17, v18, and v19) are captured and transmitted, securing analyses of a stone and soil, and keeping the storage of both rovers (v12 and v14) clear. The initial setup provides essential facts such as rover configurations, image visibility, and communication capabilities. I must leverage these facts to build my solution.
           
           **Goal Breakdown**
           
           The target state requires the following:
           *   Three image objectives (`receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, and `receivedimage(v19, v11)`) must be achieved. This necessitates the use of the `take_image` and `send_image` actions.
           *   Received analysis of at least one stone and one soil (`receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`) must also be sent. This necessitates the use of `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` actions.
           *   Rover storage must be free (`free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`).
           
           **Initial State Review**
           
           I've examined the initial state which gives valuable knowledge regarding available resources, configurations, and communication routes. Key facts include initial rover locations (v12 at v13, v14 at v15), initial storage state (free for both rovers). I need to make sure to satisfy the initial state at the goal state.
           
           **Prioritization**
           
           I've decided on the order of activities that need to occur:
           
           1.  Gathering images for v17, v18, and v19
           2.  Obtaining the analysis of a stone
           3.  Obtaining the analysis of a soil
           4.  Making certain that the storage remains free (`free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`)
           
           **Rover Selection and Reasoning**
           
           I'm opting to assign the majority of tasks to rover v12 since v12 is at the right initial configuration (v13).
           I'll use v12 to take images, sample rocks/soils and send analysis.
           Rover v14 will remain in its initial configuration and storage state.
           
           **Image Collection Plan**
           
           To capture the images, I need to get v12 into a suitable position (#o3) where the objectives are in range of the camera. The objective is to utilize the camera on rover v12 (v10). Rover v12 needs to be calibrated. After each take image, v12 will require recalibration. Finally, the collected images are sent to the lander. The route to #o3 and back to #o0.
           
           **Analysis Acquisition**
           
           For analysis, rover v12, must move to `#o5` for both sample tasks, and then move to a point for communication to the lander. After analysis, to avoid breaking `free(v12, v16)` the rocks/soil have to be released. This will keep the memory clear and avoid any issues with the storage.
           
           **Plan Construction**
           
           I'll craft a linear plan for each image, then analyze the stone and soil and transmit the results. Rover v12 will handle everything, return to its starting state, and make sure that storage for both rovers remain clear.
           
           **Continuous Parameter Allocation**
           
           In order to create the plan for the `move` actions, I will have to provide coordinates for configurations `#o0` and `#o3`.
           These coordinates will be based on the initial conditions, where the plan describes the relationship between the rover and the configuration.
           The instruction state that *I do not* need to provide a value for `#o5`, as it is not an object I am trying to communicate with in the initial state.
           A suitable `#o3` configuration is found via geometrical inspection of the given coordinate constraints.
           The choice for `#o0` will take into account the comvisible with the lander.
           
           **Final Plan and Verification**
           
           The final plan will be constructed, then, I will check that everything needed is covered: all image and analysis acquisitions, all needed `move`, `send`, `sample`, `drop` actions. I'll make sure the `free` facts stay true and that the goal conditions are met. I will then ensure that I provide the continuous parameter values `#o0` and `#o3` for the image and communication locations.

           My primary objective is to develop a plan that fulfills the goal `new-axiom@0()`. To achieve this, I'll need to break down the goal into its core components and devise a step-by-step strategy. This includes ensuring all three image objectives (v17, v18, and v19) are captured and transmitted, securing analyses of a stone and soil, and keeping the storage of both rovers (v12 and v14) clear. The initial setup provides essential facts such as rover configurations, image visibility, and communication capabilities. I must leverage these facts to build my solution.
           
           **Goal Breakdown**
           
           The target state requires the following:
           *   Three image objectives (`receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, and `receivedimage(v19, v11)`) must be achieved. This necessitates the use of the `take_image` and `send_image` actions.
           *   Received analysis of at least one stone and one soil (`receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`) must also be sent. This necessitates the use of `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` actions.
           *   Rover storage must be free (`free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`).
           
           **Initial State Review**
           
           I've examined the initial state which gives valuable knowledge regarding available resources, configurations, and communication routes. Key facts include initial rover locations (v12 at v13, v14 at v15), initial storage state (free for both rovers). I need to make sure to satisfy the initial state at the goal state.
           
           **Prioritization**
           
           I've decided on the order of activities that need to occur:
           
           1.  Gathering images for v17, v18, and v19
           2.  Obtaining the analysis of a stone
           3.  Obtaining the analysis of a soil
           4.  Making certain that the storage remains free (`free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`)
           
           **Rover Selection and Reasoning**
           
           I'm opting to assign the majority of tasks to rover v12 since v12 is at the right initial configuration (v13).
           I'll use v12 to take images, sample rocks/soils and send analysis.
           Rover v14 will remain in its initial configuration and storage state.
           
           **Image Collection Plan**
           
           To capture the images, I need to get v12 into a suitable position (#o3) where the objectives are in range of the camera. The objective is to utilize the camera on rover v12 (v10). Rover v12 needs to be calibrated. After each take image, v12 will require recalibration. Finally, the collected images are sent to the lander. The route to #o3 and back to #o0.
           
           **Analysis Acquisition**
           
           For analysis, rover v12, must move to `#o5` for both sample tasks, and then move to a point for communication to the lander. After analysis, to avoid breaking `free(v12, v16)` the rocks/soil have to be released. This will keep the memory clear and avoid any issues with the storage.
           
           **Plan Construction**
           
           I'll craft a linear plan for each image, then analyze the stone and soil and transmit the results. Rover v12 will handle everything, return to its starting state, and make sure that storage for both rovers remain clear.
           
           **Continuous Parameter Allocation**
           
           In order to create the plan for the `move` actions, I will have to provide coordinates for configurations `#o0` and `#o3`.
           These coordinates will be based on the initial conditions, where the plan describes the relationship between the rover and the configuration.
           The instruction state that *I do not* need to provide a value for `#o5`, as it is not an object I am trying to communicate with in the initial state.
           A suitable `#o3` configuration is found via geometrical inspection of the given coordinate constraints.
           The choice for `#o0` will take into account the comvisible with the lander.
           
           **Final Plan and Verification**
           
           The final plan will be constructed, then, I will check that everything needed is covered: all image and analysis acquisitions, all needed `move`, `send`, `sample`, `drop` actions. I'll make sure the `free` facts stay true and that the goal conditions are met. I will then ensure that I provide the continuous parameter values `#o0` and `#o3` for the image and communication locations.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Reasoning for Plan**
           
           Okay, here's my thought process, distilled: The user feedback invalidated my initial attempts at picking `#o3` and `#o0`, mainly because the original coordinates caused collisions with the `v20` (wall) and `v21` (block) obstacles. After carefully reviewing the problem and the constraints, I've come to a crucial realization: I need to assume that certain preconditions, like "imagevisible," "comvisible," and "above" in the initial state, are *guaranteed* by the problem setup. This is because they're already stated as true, meaning the ray-related checks are handled by the problem generator. My job is now to ensure that the rover body itself is in a valid pose (collision-free and reachable).
           
           The original error of using `#o3 = (0.1, 1.85)` was due to y overlap with v21, and possibly with the x for v20. After several failed attempts, I found that I need to assume that the 'ray' for `imagevisible` *can* pass through the obstacles and only the *robot* position is constrained by them. This led me to pick new continuous values for `#o3`, `#o0` and `#o5`: The plan picks `x` coordinates further from the `v20` wall and the `v21` box so that `v12` does not physically collide with either (so to the right and above these points on the map). This ensures that those configurations for the *rover body* are collision-free. 
           
           The strategy is for `v12` to use those configurations to take images, communicate, and sample rocks. Since `v14` never moves, the final plan is valid for all objectives. The new configurations are: `#o3` = (0.9, 1.5) (for imaging), `#o0` = (1.0, -1.0) (for communication), and `#o5` = (1.0, -0.5) (for rock sampling), all for `v12`. I am certain this plan works, given the interpretations made.

(Thoughts: **Plan Development for Rover Configuration**
           
           Okay, here's what I've figured out. We've got two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, and some specific goals. Previous attempts at configurations for `v12` were failing, likely due to obstacles. The key is to satisfy these conditions: both rovers at their initial positions, storage free, all images received, and soil and stone analyses received.
           
           I've broken this down into a collaborative plan. `v14` will handle the left side, imaging `v18` and `v19`, sampling a stone, and communicating with the lander. `v12` takes the right side, focusing on `v17`, sampling soil, and also communicating with the lander. The crucial part is figuring out reachable, collision-free configurations for both.
           
           **Reachability and Collision Avoidance:**
           
           -   `v12` starts at (1.0, -1.75). It's confined by a vertical wall (`v20`) and a block (`v21`). I need to find locations for `v12` to take pictures and sample within 2 units.
           -   `v14` starts at (-1.0, -1.75).  It's primarily affected by the vertical wall. The block is on the other side.
               
               I've modeled the rover as a bounding box centered on the (x, y) location provided. To ensure collision-free movement, I'll need to make sure the entire box (width/length of approx 0.366 (x) and 0.358 (y)) of the rover is considered when determining if the location is valid.
           
           **Configuration Strategy:**
           
           My approach is to find configurations that are:
           
           -   Reachable from each rover's starting point.
           -   Collision-free with the obstacles.
           -   Within range for imaging and communication.
               
           **Specific Configuration Selection:**
           
           After analyzing, I arrived at these configurations:
           
           *   **v14:**
               *   **#o3 (for v14, v18 and v19): (-1.0, 1.0)** - This lets `v14` image `v18` and `v19` without colliding.
               *   **#o0 (for v14, v9): (-1.5, -2.0)** - Reached to comm with lander.
               *   **#o5 (for v14, v1): (-1.1, 2.0)** - A viable position to collect stone `v1` (with the rover being above it).
           
           *   **v12:**
               *   **#o3 (for v12, v17): (1.5, 1.0)** -  Makes `v17` visible.
               *   **#o0 (for v12, v9): (1.0, -1.0)** - Within communication range of the lander.
               *   **#o5 (for v12, v5): (0.6, -1.2)** - This places `v12` in a suitable location for sampling `v5` (which is needed to fulfill the "soil analysis" request)
           
           These positions will make sure all tasks can be performed.
           
           **Plan Implementation and Order of Operations:**
           
           The action plan will be carried out in this order:
           
           **v14's Actions:**
           
           1.  Move to imaging.
           2.  Calibrate and take images for targets v18 and v19.
           3.  Move to rock sampling configuration.
           4.  Sample the stone `v1`.
           5.  Move to communication location.
           6.  Send images for v18, v19, and the analysis of sample v1.
           7.  Drop the sampled rock `v16` and return to the starting position.
           
           **v12's Actions:**
           
           1.  Move to imaging.
           2.  Calibrate and take an image for v17.
           3.  Move to sampling configuration.
           4.  Sample soil `v5`.
           5.  Move to communication position.
           6.  Send the image for `v17` and analysis of sample `v5`.
           7.  Drop the sampled material and return to the starting position.
           
           **Assumptions and Justification:**
           
           *   I'm assuming straight-line paths for movement and that the configurations are in "open" space.
           *   The "maximum distance" is 2 for `imagevisible` and 4 for `comvisible`.
           *   I have assigned

(Thoughts: **Revising Rover Configurations for Reachability and Collision Avoidance**
           
           Okay, so the initial plan had some issues. It looks like my choice of continuous configurations for the rovers led to several problems with reachability and collisions. Let's break down the issues and how I addressed them:
           
           1.  **Communication Configuration near Lander (v9):** The first problem was that the rover couldn't be *inside* the lander to communicate, which I know is a common oversight. I need to position the rover *near* the lander, but outside its bounding box. I re-calculated the lander's AABB and selected coordinates that placed the rover adjacent to it, such as `(-1.0, -2.0)`.
           
           2.  **Rover "Above" Target (v1):** For the "above" predicate, it seems my previous configurations were too close to the target rock, causing potential collisions or making it impossible for the rover to extend its arm downwards. I adjusted the configurations to be further away from the rock, allowing for the robot's arm to be positioned *above* the target rock for sampling. I went with `(-1.0, 1.8)` instead of the previous placement.
           
           3.  **Target Imaging (v17):** The initial imaging position for v12 was problematic because it was likely blocked by the existing obstacles. I had to choose a slightly different position for the rover. After considering the obstacles and potential paths, I adjusted the position to `(1.0, 1.5)`.
           
           4.  **Lander Communication (v9) - Wall Obstacle:** The communication plan seemed correct, but the chosen rover position made it unreachable. The path from the rover's initial position crossed `v20`. So, I moved it to a spot on the opposite side of `v20` using `(0.5, -1.5)`. This is in range and ensures line of sight based on the initial state of the problem.
           
           5.  **Target Soil (v5):** Finally, I realized that my chosen position was *inside* the target. I adjusted the configuration to a position *above* the target rock to allow for collection, instead of inside it. I chose `(0.6, -0.9)` which will allow the robot to be above it.
           
           Now, with this new knowledge, I am confident in my approach for both rovers.
           
           I have revised the plan:
           
           **Rover v14 (starting at `v15`: (-1.0, -1.75))**
           
           *   **Imaging & Communication:**
               *   Targets: `v18` (far left), `v19` (center-right), `v9` (lander, far left).
               *   Rocks: `v1` (stone, far left).
               *   `#o3` (imaging): `(-1.0, 1.0)`.
               *   `#o0` (comms): `(-1.0, -2.0)`.
               *   `#o5` (sampling): `(-1.0, 1.8)`.
           
           **Rover v12 (starting at `v13`: (1.0, -1.75))**
           
           *   **Imaging & Communication:**
               *   Targets: `v17` (far right), `v9` (lander, far left).
               *   Rocks: `v5` (soil, center-right).
               *   `#o3` (imaging): `(1.0, 1.5)`.
               *   `#o0` (comms): `(0.5, -1.5)`.
               *   `#o5` (sampling): `(0.6, -0.9)`.
           
           **Verification:** I've carefully re-verified all trajectories to ensure they are collision-free and reach their target configurations. The movement between configurations (`#o2` parameter) is assumed to be a valid trajectory as long as the start and end points are good. I am confident that these new configurations will be robust.

Model:     **Revising Rover Configurations for Reachability and Collision Avoidance**
           
           Okay, so the initial plan had some issues. It looks like my choice of continuous configurations for the rovers led to several problems with reachability and collisions. Let's break down the issues and how I addressed them:
           
           1.  **Communication Configuration near Lander (v9):** The first problem was that the rover couldn't be *inside* the lander to communicate, which I know is a common oversight. I need to position the rover *near* the lander, but outside its bounding box. I re-calculated the lander's AABB and selected coordinates that placed the rover adjacent to it, such as `(-1.0, -2.0)`.
           
           2.  **Rover "Above" Target (v1):** For the "above" predicate, it seems my previous configurations were too close to the target rock, causing potential collisions or making it impossible for the rover to extend its arm downwards. I adjusted the configurations to be further away from the rock, allowing for the robot's arm to be positioned *above* the target rock for sampling. I went with `(-1.0, 1.8)` instead of the previous placement.
           
           3.  **Target Imaging (v17):** The initial imaging position for v12 was problematic because it was likely blocked by the existing obstacles. I had to choose a slightly different position for the rover. After considering the obstacles and potential paths, I adjusted the position to `(1.0, 1.5)`.

(Thoughts: **My Final Plan to Conquer This Rover Navigation Challenge**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The problem seems to revolve around ensuring the rovers can *reach* their designated configurations, especially considering potential obstacles and communication/imaging ranges. My strategy hinges on carefully selecting configurations that are: 1) close to the rovers' starting points if possible, 2) close to the targets, and 3) ensure they're on a path well-defined with my primitive motions.
           
           **Understanding the Constraints:**
           
           The map is divided by a wall (`v20`) in the middle. The rovers start on opposite sides, and need to avoid this, as well as two additional obstacles (`v21` and `v22`). There is the key constraint that the provided predicates `imagevisible` and `comvisible` guarantee line-of-sight if a valid path exists. The real twist seems to be the strict motion primitives, or more precisely, the `move` action.
           
           **Rover v14 (starting at -1.0, -1.75)**
           
           1.  **Image v18 and v19:** I'll move to *(-0.5, 1.5)* using the intermediate object #o3 for the cameras to take images, and *then* take the image. I believe that it has the required imaging range and is not occluded.
           2.  **Sampling Rock v4:** I'll move to *(-1.1, -0.7)* above the rock v4 so that I can sample it.
           3.  **Communication:** I'll move to *(-1.5, -1.5)* to communicate, and then I can send the images from previous steps and the samples.
           
           **Rover v12 (starting at 1.0, -1.75)**
           
           1.  **Image v17:** I'll move to *(1.5, 1.0)* using #o3, the object representing the camera view.
           2.  **Sampling Soil v5:** I'll move to *(0.6, -1.0)* above the rock v5 so that I can sample it.
           3.  **Communication:** I'll move to *(1.5, -2.0)* to communicate, and then I can send the images from previous steps and the samples.
           
           For each of these steps, I need to ensure that the intermediate configurations used for imaging, sampling, and communication are within a valid communication or imaging range, that there is no occlusion, and that the intermediate path and goal path are valid.
           
           **Revised Reasoning:**
           
           I will focus on testing the proposed configurations and verifying that the `motion` predicates allow the rover to move to a given configuration. In particular, the predicates are in the form of `motion(?v, ?q1, ?t, ?q2)`, meaning the robot can move from q1 to q2 using trajectory t.
           
           **Final Plan with specific configurations:**
           
           This should do the job!
