           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Alright, let's get down to brass tacks. The goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`.  This seems straightforward enough at first. However, breaking down `new-axiom@0()`, reveals a few sub-goals: capturing images (`receivedimage`), analyzing rocks and soil, and transmitting these analyses back to the lander. The initial state analysis shows these sub-goals are *not* currently met.
           
           The real challenge, though, is the constraints. I'm only allowed to use a very specific set of actions – the "valid action instances" provided. Any action *not* in that list? Forget about it. This is a severe limitation.
           
           **Navigating the Constraints & Identifying the Bottleneck**
           
           I quickly realized the heart of the problem lies in *movement*. To meet those sub-goals, I need the rover to move to specific configurations (e.g., `#o3` for imaging, `#o5` for sampling, `#o0` for communication). But the *only* move actions given are essentially no-ops:  `v14` stays at `v15`, and `v12` stays at `v13`. These static movements are the deal-breaker.
           
           The lack of any other *move* actions – specifically those to the necessary configurations – is a major roadblock.  This severely limits my options and the plan's feasibility.
           
           **Tackling the Action Deficit**
           
           The absence of key actions like `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` is striking. While these actions are essential for completing the sub-goals of the `new-axiom@0()`, none of these essential actions are explicitly given in my actions list.
           
           The initial strategy would be to use `rover v14` which has the camera and store for the actions, but the lack of movement actions means there is no way for `v14` to actually perform these tasks. I have to play the cards dealt.
           
           **The Unreachable Conclusion**
           
           Here's the rub: I *need* those actions to achieve the final goal. But since I can't use them (per the very clear instruction), the goal, at least as I understand it, is unreachable.
           
           I've circled back and re-read the instructions and the axioms many times, but there seems to be no way around the limitation. So, with a heavy heart, I have to conclude that given the stated constraints, this goal is *unachievable*.  It's simply not possible with the available tools.
