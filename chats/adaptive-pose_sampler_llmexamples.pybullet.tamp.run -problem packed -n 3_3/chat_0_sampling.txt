           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27x0.27. The object is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.09x0.09. Since the object is much smaller than the surface, there's ample space for many stable placements. I will generate a diverse set of placements by varying both position and orientation. I will prioritize placing the object near the center of the surface, but also explore positions closer to the edges. Since the object is square, rotations by multiples of pi/2 will result in the same bounding box, but I will include various rotations to provide a diverse set of placements.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene has a single square surface (0.27x0.27) centered at the origin. We previously placed object ID 5 at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Object ID 4 is also a square, with dimensions approximately 0.098x0.098. Since object 5 is at the center, I need to place object 4 such that it does not collide with object 5. The total width of the two objects (assuming they are placed side-by-side without rotation) is about 0.09 + 0.098 = 0.188. This is less than the surface width of 0.27, so there is space for both. I will try to place object 4 off-center to avoid collision with object 5. Since object 5 is at (0,0), any placement of object 4 where its bounding box does not overlap with (0,0) for object 5 will avoid collision. I will generate a diverse set of placements, taking into account the size of both objects and the surface.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene has a single square surface (0.27x0.27) centered at the origin. We have successfully placed object ID 5 at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and object ID 4 at (0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.0). Object ID 6 is also a square, with dimensions approximately 0.096x0.096.
           
           I need to place object 6 such that it does not collide with object 4 or object 5.
           Object 5 is at (0,0) and has width ~0.09.
           Object 4 is at (0.05, 0) and has width ~0.098.
           The right edge of object 5 is at 0 + 0.09/2 = 0.045.
           The left edge of object 4 is at 0.05 - 0.098/2 = 0.05 - 0.049 = 0.001.
           These objects are very close, potentially even slightly overlapping depending on exact bounding box definition, but the system reported they were stable. I will assume "stable" means non-colliding.
           
           I need to place object 6 such that its bounding box does not overlap with the occupied regions.
           To avoid object 5 (at x=0), I can place it with a sufficiently large positive or negative x-coordinate, or a sufficiently large positive or negative y-coordinate.
           To avoid object 4 (at x=0.05), I need to consider its position.
           Given object 4's x-coordinate is 0.05 and its half-width is 0.049, its x-range is approximately [0.001, 0.099].
           Object 5's x-range is approximately [-0.045, 0.045].
           This means the x-axis is fairly occupied in the range roughly [-0.045, 0.099].
           
           A good strategy would be to place object 6 along the y-axis, or with a negative x-coordinate that is sufficiently far from object 5.
           Let's try placing object 6 along the y-axis, centered at (0, Y), where Y is large enough to avoid object 5. Half width of object 5 is ~0.045. Half width of object 6 is ~0.048. So, if Y > 0.045 + 0.048 = 0.093, they should not collide in Y. I will start with y = 0.05 or y = -0.05 and use rotations as well.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene now has two surfaces.
           Surface 0: ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)), which is a large rectangular surface (0.6x1.2) centered at the origin.
           Surface 1: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)), which is a smaller square surface (0.27x0.27) centered at the origin. This is the same surface as in previous requests.
           
           Object ID 5 is a square with dimensions approximately 0.09x0.09.
           
           We have previous successful placements for object ID 5. Some of these are:
           (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 (on surface 0, at (0,0))
           (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.0
           (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, -0.02, 0.0
           (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02
           (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.02
           
           Note that the previous success reports for ID 5 were implicitly on surface 0, as it was the only surface available in the previous requests. However, now surface 1 is also available, which has the same dimensions as the old surface 0. I will consider the objects previously placed (ID 4 and ID 6) as being on the *new* surface 1, to maintain consistency in their relative placements.
           
           Currently placed objects (assuming they are on surface 1 from previous requests, unless specified otherwise for new requests):
           (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0
           (ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.0
           (ID: 6) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05
           (ID: 6) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.05
           (ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, -0.05, 0.0
           (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.0
           (ID: 6) -- 0, 0.0, -0.05, 0.0
           (ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05
           (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, -0.02, 0.0
           (ID: 6) -- 0, 0.0, -0.05, 0.05
           (ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.05
           (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02
           (ID: 6) -- 0, 0.0, -0.05, -0.05
           (ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.05
           (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.02
           
           This is a bit confusing, as the success report implies multiple successful placements for the same ID. I will interpret this as the system learning about stable placements and now I have to propose a *new* stable placement for object 5, *given the current objects in the scene*. However, the "New request" for object 5 means I need to place a *new instance* of object 5. To avoid confusion with multiple instances of the same ID, I will assume the previous placements for IDs 4, 5, and 6 are for *distinct* objects with those IDs. The problem statement does not clarify how to handle multiple successful placements for the same ID. Given "If you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene.", this implies that if I am requested to place object 5 again, it's a new attempt for object 5, not a new instance.
           However, "objects will be associated with IDs. If you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j." implies distinct objects.
           
           I will proceed by assuming that the list of *successful* placements are for *distinct objects* (e.g., first (ID: 5) is object 5a, second (ID: 5) is object 5b, etc.). This seems to be the most robust interpretation.
           So, the occupied regions are on surface 1:
           Object 5 (at 0,0,0)
           Object 4 (at 0,0.05,0)
           Object 6 (at 0,0,0.05)
           Object 6 (at 0,0,-0.05)
           Object 4 (at 0,-0.05,0)
           Object 5 (at 0,0.02,0)
           Object 6 (at 0,-0.05,0)
           Object 4 (at 0,0,0.05)
           Object 5 (at 0,-0.02,0)
           Object 6 (at 0,-0.05,0.05)
           Object 4 (at 0,0,-0.05)
           Object 5 (at 0,0,0.02)
           Object 6 (at 0,-0.05,-0.05)
           Object 4 (at 0,0.05,0.05)
           Object 5 (at 0,0,-0.02)
           
           This interpretation of successful placements means surface 1 is extremely crowded. Given the object extents, many of these "successful" placements would logically collide. For instance, (ID: 5) at (0,0,0) and (ID: 5) at (0,0.02,0) with half-widths of ~0.045 would definitely overlap.
           
           I will switch to a more conservative interpretation: the list of successes is a historical record of *valid configurations* that have been found. When a *new* request comes for an object with a given ID, I am simply placing *that object* on the scene, and I need to avoid collision with *any previously placed objects* that are currently on the table, as if there's only one instance of each ID that has been placed.
           The problem statement: "If you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j." This supports a single instance per ID.
           "If you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene." This indicates that previous placements for the *same ID* were attempts for that *same single object instance*. Therefore, the previous successes for object 5 are *alternatives* for placing object 5, but only one of them is "active" at any given time if the system has not indicated collision.
           
           Given the current request is for ID 5, and we have *many* successful placements for ID 5 already (implying the previous ones might have been successful, but then a non-fixed obstacle caused a collision), I will consider placing the *current* object ID 5. I should avoid previously known placements for object 4 and object 6. Since I have to provide 50 placements, I will generate a diverse set, prioritizing open spaces on surface 0 (the larger surface).
           
           Let's assume the previous successful placements imply that there are no active instances of ID 4 or ID 6 for this new request for ID 5, unless they were also specified as fixed. Since they are not, I will consider only the surfaces as obstacles. I need to make sure the object is fully contained within the bounds of the surface.
           
           So, I need to place object ID 5 (0.09x0.09) on either surface 0 or surface 1.
           Surface 0: ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6))
           Surface 1: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))
           
           Object half-extents: 0.04526.
           Max X on surface 0: 0.3 - 0.04526 = 0.25474
           Min X on surface 0: -0.3 + 0.04526 = -0.25474
           Max Y on surface 0: 0.6 - 0.04526 = 0.55474
           Min Y on surface 0: -0.6 + 0.04526 = -0.55474
           
           Max X on surface 1: 0.135 - 0.04526 = 0.08974
           Min X on surface 1: -0.135 + 0.04526 = -0.08974
           Max Y on surface 1: 0.135 - 0.04526 = 0.08974
           Min Y on surface 1: -0.135 + 0.04526 = -0.08974
           
           I will generate placements on both surfaces, varying positions and orientations.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still has two surfaces:
           Surface 0: ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6))
           Surface 1: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))
           
           The new request is for object ID 4, which is a square with dimensions 0.07x0.07. Its half-extent is 0.035.
           
           Based on the cumulative successes, there are many "objects" (or rather, successful placements that indicate free space) present. Again, the interpretation of multiple successful placements for the same ID is critical. I will continue with the interpretation that the successful placements for IDs 4, 5, and 6 are for *distinct objects* on the scene. If this is not the case, and only the *last* placement for each ID is active, then the scene would be much emptier. However, the problem statement "If you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j" implies distinct objects. The problem statement *also* says "If you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle". This is where the ambiguity lies. For a conservative approach, I will assume that *all* the provided successful placements describe regions that are currently occupied by objects. This creates a very crowded scene, especially on surface 1.
           
           Let's list the actively placed objects, assuming all successful placements are now occupied by distinct objects (e.g. 5a, 5b, etc. or a more complex definition of collision):
           On Surface 0 (the larger one):
           (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0
           (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.0
           (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, -0.02, 0.0
           (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02
           (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.02
           (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.0
           
           The successful placements for ID 4 and ID 6 from previous steps were on surface 0, which was the only surface at the time. Now there are two surfaces. In the last request, some of the placements for ID 5 were on surface 1. The successes provided for *this* request (the most recent list of `(ID: 5) -- 0, ...` values) refer to placements on `surface 0`.
           
           So, the occupied regions are:
           On Surface 0:
           - Object ID 5 at (0,0,0) (half-width ~0.045) -> X: [-0.045, 0.045], Y: [-0.045, 0.045]
           - Object ID 5 at (0.02,0,0) -> X: [-0.025, 0.065], Y: [-0.045, 0.045]
           - Object ID 5 at (-0.02,0,0) -> X: [-0.065, 0.025], Y: [-0.045, 0.045]
           - Object ID 5 at (0,0.02,0) -> X: [-0.045, 0.045], Y: [-0.025, 0.065]
           - Object ID 5 at (0, -0.02,0) -> X: [-0.045, 0.045], Y: [-0.065, 0.025]
           - Object ID 5 at (0.1,0,0) -> X: [0.055, 0.145], Y: [-0.045, 0.045]
           
           These placements for ID 5 on surface 0 are very close and many would overlap. This indicates my interpretation of "multiple active instances of the same ID" might be incorrect, or the system does not enforce strict AABB collision for multiple instances of the same ID unless a new ID is being placed.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the most robust interpretation:
           1. "If you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j." This implies that objects with *different* IDs must not collide.
           2. "If you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle". This means that when a new request comes for object *ID N*, all previous *successful* placements for *other IDs* (e.g. ID M, P, etc.) are fixed, but the previous placements for *ID N* itself are just a history of what worked *before* the current failure (due to a non-fixed obstacle). So, for the current request of ID 4, the successful placements for ID 5 and ID 6 are considered fixed obstacles that I must avoid.
           
           So, the fixed obstacles in the scene are:
           - Any success for ID 5 that was on surface 0:
               - (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) -> object 5 at (0,0) on surface 0. Extents: X +/- 0.045, Y +/- 0.045.
               - (0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.0) -> object 5 at (0.02,0) on surface 0. Extents: X [0.02-0.045, 0.02+0.045], Y +/- 0.045
               - (0, 0.0, -0.02, 0.0) -> object 5 at (-0.02,0) on surface 0.
               - (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02) -> object 5 at (0,0.02) on surface 0.
               - (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.02) -> object 5 at (0,-0.02) on surface 0.
               - (0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.0) -> object 5 at (0.1,0) on surface 0.
           - Any success for ID 6 (from previous request, which used surface 0 as the only surface, now surface 1 has same dimensions):
               - (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05) -> object 6 at (0,0.05) on surface 0. Extents: X +/- 0.048, Y [0.05-0.048, 0.05+0.048]
               - (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.05) -> object 6 at (0,-0.05) on surface 0.
               - (0, 0.0, -0.05, 0.0) -> object 6 at (-0.05,0) on surface 0.
               - (0, 0.0, -0.05, 0.05) -> object 6 at (-0.05,0.05) on surface 0.
               - (0, 0.0, -0.05, -0.05) -> object 6 at (-0.05,-0.05) on surface 0.
           
           Wait, the previous successes from the *first* request for ID 4 and ID 6 were implicitly on surface 0, which has been replaced by surface 1 in subsequent requests. This is a crucial detail.
           In the *first* request, only `0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))` was present. Let's call this original surface S_old.
           In the *second* request (for ID 4), S_old was still surface 0.
           In the *third* request (for ID 6), S_old was still surface 0.
           In the *fourth* request (for ID 5), the surfaces changed:
           `0: ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6))` (New large surface)
           `1: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))` (This is S_old, now named surface 1)
           
           The successes are reported with `surf_idx`. So:
           Object 5 (ID 5, size ~0.09x0.09):
           - `(ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0` (This means on the *new* surface 0)
           - `(ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.0` (on *new* surface 0)
           - `(ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, -0.02, 0.0` (on *new* surface 0)
           - `(ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02` (on *new* surface 0)
           - `(ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.02` (on *new* surface 0)
           - `(ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.0` (on *new* surface 0)
           
           Object 4 (ID 4, size ~0.098x0.098, but *now* 0.07x0.07 in this request):
           - `(ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.0` (This was on `surf_idx 0` of *previous* requests, which is now `surf_idx 1`). So, object 4 at (0.05,0) on surface 1.
           - `(ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, -0.05, 0.0` (object 4 at (-0.05,0) on surface 1)
           - `(ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05` (object 4 at (0,0.05) on surface 1)
           - `(ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.05` (object 4 at (0,-0.05) on surface 1)
           - `(ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.05` (object 4 at (0.05,0.05) on surface 1)
           
           Object 6 (ID 6, size ~0.096x0.096):
           - `(ID: 6) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05` (object 6 at (0,0.05) on surface 1)
           - `(ID: 6) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.05` (object 6 at (0,-0.05) on surface 1)
           - `(ID: 6) -- 0, 0.0, -0.05, 0.0` (object 6 at (-0.05,0) on surface 1)
           - `(ID: 6) -- 0, 0.0, -0.05, 0.05` (object 6 at (-0.05,0.05) on surface 1)
           - `(ID: 6) -- 0, 0.0, -0.05, -0.05` (object 6 at (-0.05,-0.05) on surface 1)
           
           This interpretation makes more sense. Objects of a certain ID retain their size from when they were *initially placed*. The new request for ID 4 means I am placing *a new instance* of object ID 4, but *this time* its size is 0.07x0.07. So the object ID 4 I am placing *now* is smaller than the object 4's already on the table. This is important.
           
           So, for this request for Object ID 4 (current size 0.07x0.07, half-extent 0.035), I must avoid all fixed obstacles (all instances of ID 5 and ID 6, and previous instances of ID 4 with *their original sizes*). This is extremely crowded.
           
           Given the ambiguity, the most robust strategy is to assume that the problem wants *me* to place a new instance of ID 4, with its *new* specified dimensions, and it must not collide with any of the *existing* successful placements of *any* object ID (including previous IDs of 4, 5, 6).
           
           This still means surface 1 is heavily occupied. Surface 0 (the large one) has only ID 5 objects placed. The half-extent for the *new* object ID 4 is 0.035.
           
           Let's re-list the active objects (and their bounding boxes) on Surface 0 (the big one):
           Object 5 (size ~0.09x0.09, half ~0.045)
           - (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0): X[-0.045, 0.045], Y[-0.045, 0.045]
           - (0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.0): X[-0.025, 0.065], Y[-0.045, 0.045]
           - (0, 0.0, -0.02, 0.0): X[-0.065, 0.025], Y[-0.045, 0.045]
           - (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02): X[-0.045, 0.045], Y[-0.025, 0.065]
           - (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.02): X[-0.045, 0.045], Y[-0.065, 0.025]
           - (0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.0): X[0.055, 0.145], Y[-0.045, 0.045]
           
           These overlaps are quite substantial. For example, object 5 at (0,0) and object 5 at (0.02,0) would overlap. This strongly suggests that I should *not* assume all historical successful placements are simultaneously active.
           
           The only way to reconcile "If you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j" with the successful placements is if only *one* instance of each ID is "active" at a time, or if the "successful" placements of the *same ID* are only used for the current object's failure history.
           
           I will take the most conservative interpretation of the "current state":
           1. For an ID being requested (e.g. ID 4 now), the list of successes for that ID in the current batch implies *alternative* successful placements in the past, but only *one* of them (the most recent one that led to a non-fixed collision, if any) is the "active" one that needs to be moved. Since this is a *new* request for ID 4 with *new dimensions*, I'm effectively placing a new object.
           2. For *other* IDs (ID 5 and ID 6), their *most recent* successful placement (as reported in the latest list of successes) defines their current, fixed position.
           
           This means:
           - Object 5 (size ~0.09x0.09) is at (0.1, 0.0) on Surface 0.
               - X range: [0.1 - 0.045, 0.1 + 0.045] = [0.055, 0.145]
               - Y range: [-0.045, 0.045]
           - Object 6 (size ~0.096x0.096) is at (-0.05, -0.05) on Surface 1.
               - X range: [-0.05 - 0.048, -0.05 + 0.048] = [-0.098, -0.002]
               - Y range: [-0.05 - 0.048, -0.05 + 0.048] = [-0.098, -0.002]
           - Previous instances of ID 4 are not listed in the latest success list, meaning they might have been moved or failed. Given it's a new request for ID 4, I only need to consider objects 5 and 6 as fixed.
           
           So the scene is much less crowded.
           Object ID 4 (current request, size 0.07x0.07, half-extent 0.035).
           
           On Surface 0 ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)):
           - Object 5 is at (0.1, 0.0). Its X range is [0.055, 0.145], Y range is [-0.045, 0.045].
           - Available space on surface 0:
               - Max X: 0.3 - 0.035 = 0.265
               - Min X: -0.3 + 0.035 = -0.265
               - Max Y: 0.6 - 0.035 = 0.565
               - Min Y: -0.6 + 0.035 = -0.565
           
           On Surface 1 ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)):
           - Object 6 is at (-0.05, -0.05). Its X range is [-0.098, -0.002], Y range is [-0.098, -0.002].
           - Available space on surface 1:
               - Max X: 0.135 - 0.035 = 0.1
               - Min X: -0.135 + 0.035 = -0.1
               - Max Y: 0.135 - 0.035 = 0.1
               - Min Y: -0.135 + 0.035 = -0.1
           
           I will generate placements for the new object 4 on both surfaces, avoiding the defined obstacles.
           For Surface 0, I can place it at (0,0) as it won't collide with Object 5 at (0.1,0). The minimum distance between centers of object 4 and object 5 to avoid collision on X axis is half_w4 + half_w5 = 0.035 + 0.045 = 0.08. Object 5 is at X=0.1. So object 4 at X=0 would not collide.
           
           For Surface 1, object 6 is at (-0.05, -0.05). The new object 4 has half-extent 0.035.
           Its X range is [x-0.035, x+0.035], Y range is [y-0.035, y+0.035].
           Object 6's X range is [-0.098, -0.002], Y range is [-0.098, -0.002].
           If I place object 4 at (0,0) on surface 1: X[-0.035, 0.035], Y[-0.035, 0.035]. This would not collide with object 6.
           
           This interpretation provides much more reasonable free space.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene remains with two surfaces:
           Surface 0: ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6))
           Surface 1: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))
           
           The new request is for object ID 6, which is a square with dimensions approximately 0.096x0.096. Its half-extent is approximately 0.048.
           
           I will continue with the interpretation that for the current request for ID 6, the list of successes contains fixed objects for all *other* IDs (ID 4 and ID 5). For ID 6 itself, these are previous attempts, and I need to find a *new* valid placement for ID 6.
           
           Let's list the actively placed objects (and their bounding boxes) that serve as fixed obstacles based on the *most recent* successful placements for each ID in the provided success list:
           
           - Object 5 (size ~0.09x0.09, half ~0.045):
               - The latest successful placement for ID 5 is `(ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.1`.
               - So, Object 5 is at (0.0, -0.1) on Surface 0.
               - X range: [-0.045, 0.045]
               - Y range: [-0.1 - 0.045, -0.1 + 0.045] = [-0.145, -0.055]
           
           - Object 4 (size 0.07x0.07, half 0.035 - using the most recent size for ID 4 from the previous request):
               - The latest successful placement for ID 4 is `(ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.1`.
               - So, Object 4 is at (0.0, -0.1) on Surface 0.
               - X range: [-0.035, 0.035]
               - Y range: [-0.1 - 0.035, -0.1 + 0.035] = [-0.135, -0.065]
           
           Notice an immediate problem: Object 5 is at (0, -0.1) and Object 4 is at (0, -0.1). Since they have different IDs, they *must* not collide. Their bounding boxes would clearly overlap. This suggests that my interpretation of "most recent success is the active one" might be flawed if these are indeed considered fixed and stable.
           
           The problem states "If you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j." And then gives a list of "successes". This list *could* represent the full set of current objects, regardless of how they logically overlap. This would make the scene extremely crowded.
           
           Let's go back to the interpretation that when a request for ID_X comes, any successes for ID_Y (Y != X) are considered placed fixed obstacles. For ID_X, any prior successes are *just a history* of valid placements, and I need to find a *new* valid one for this instance of ID_X, avoiding the fixed obstacles.
           
           Given the overlap of (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.1 and (ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.1, the interpretation that "all previous successful placements for *other* IDs are fixed objects" and "the *latest* success for each other ID defines its position" is inconsistent. It's more likely that the system uses a more sophisticated way to define "fixed obstacles" or the provided list of successes is just a record of valid options, and *not* the current scene state.
           
           The most practical approach given the ambiguity is to assume that the environment is cleared of non-requested objects, *unless* they are explicitly causing a collision for the current request.
           Since the problem explicitly says "If you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j", it implies there *are* fixed objects in the scene.
           
           Let's use the interpretation that the list of successes represent all currently placed *unique* objects with their given IDs, and I need to place the *new* object ID 6 without colliding with *any* of them. This implies that the multiple listings for the same ID in the success list are not all active simultaneously for collision checking against *new* objects.
           
           Therefore, for the current request (ID 6), I will consider the *single most recent* placement for each *different* ID (ID 4 and ID 5) as the active fixed obstacles.
           - Object 5 (size ~0.09x0.09) is at (0.0, -0.1) on Surface 0.
           - Object 4 (size 0.07x0.07) is at (0.0, -0.1) on Surface 0.
           
           This is a problem as they are at the same location. The system itself must handle this collision implicitly. I will assume the system allows placements at the same spot for different IDs if they were both "successful" in previous steps, and I just need to find a space for ID 6 that avoids *either* of these (as they overlap each other). The combined bounding box of 5 and 4 at (0, -0.1) would be:
           X: [-max(0.045, 0.035), max(0.045, 0.035)] = [-0.045, 0.045]
           Y: [-0.1 - max(0.045, 0.035), -0.1 + max(0.045, 0.035)] = [-0.145, -0.055]
           
           So, on surface 0, the region X[-0.045, 0.045], Y[-0.145, -0.055] is occupied.
           The object I'm placing (ID 6) is size ~0.096x0.096, half-extent ~0.048.
           
           Available space on surface 0:
           - Max X: 0.3 - 0.048 = 0.252
           - Min X: -0.3 + 0.048 = -0.252
           - Max Y: 0.6 - 0.048 = 0.552
           - Min Y: -0.6 + 0.048 = -0.552
           
           I need to find a position (x,y) for object 6 such that its bounding box [x-0.048, x+0.048] x [y-0.048, y+0.048] does not overlap with the combined obstacle.
           A position like (0,0) on surface 0 should be free (its Y range would be [-0.048, 0.048], which doesn't overlap with [-0.145, -0.055]).
           
           What about surface 1? There are no ID 4 or ID 5 objects placed on surface 1 according to the latest successes. So surface 1 should be completely free. This seems like the most logical place to put the new object ID 6.
           
           Available space on surface 1 ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)):
           - Max X: 0.135 - 0.048 = 0.087
           - Min X: -0.135 + 0.048 = -0.087
           - Max Y: 0.135 - 0.048 = 0.087
           - Min Y: -0.135 + 0.048 = -0.087
           
           I will prioritize placements on surface 1 as it is currently empty of other objects, and then consider surface 0 if more placements are needed.
