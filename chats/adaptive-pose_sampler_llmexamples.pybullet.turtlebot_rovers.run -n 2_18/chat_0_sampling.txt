User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is largely enclosed by a rectangular boundary defined by AABBs 0-4. There's a central vertical obstacle (AABB 5). Several smaller obstacles (AABBs 6-20) are scattered within this space. My strategy is to select positions around the target point at varying angles and distances (within the max_range of 2), while trying to avoid the obvious fixed obstacles.
           
           Positions:
           ({target_point.x + 1.5} {target_point.y})
           ({target_point.x - 1.5} {target_point.y})
           ({target_point.x} {target_point.y + 1.5})

Model:     The scene is enclosed by boundaries defined by AABBs 0-4. There's a central vertical obstacle (AABB 5). Other smaller obstacles (AABBs 6-20) are scattered. I will try to generate positions at different angles and distances from the target point, within the max_range of 2, while being mindful of the boundaries and known obstacles. I will prioritize positions that are likely to have a clear line of sight.
           
           Positions:
           ({target_point.x + 1.2} {target_point.y})
