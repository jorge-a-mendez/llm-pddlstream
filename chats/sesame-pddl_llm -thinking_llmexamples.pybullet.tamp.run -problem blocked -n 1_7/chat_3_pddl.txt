           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Plan to Achieve new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, so the task at hand is to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a certain *type* be *on* another object.  Specifically, I need `v12` to be `on v18` because I know that `v12` is of `type v17`.  Luckily, from the initial state, I already know that `v12` can be supported by `v18` at pose `#o2`.  So really, I just need to get `v12` to pose `#o2`.
           
           Looking at the world, I see that `v12` is currently at pose `v13`.  It is also graspable and has a known grasp, `#o1`, and has pre-computed kinematics available for the arm `v4`, both for `v13` and for `#o2`.
           
           Therefore, the plan is straightforward:
           
           1.  **Pick:** Use arm `v4` to pick `v12` from its current pose, `v13`, using grasp `#o1`, base configuration `#o3`, and arm trajectory `#o4`. This is represented by the action `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)`. All preconditions are met as there is kinematics for the pick.
           2.  **Place:** Use arm `v4` to place `v12` at the target pose, `#o2`, using the same grasp, base configuration, and arm trajectory. This is represented by the action `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`.  Again, kinematics are available, so all the preconditions are met.
           
           After these two steps, `v12` will be at `#o2`, fulfilling the preconditions needed for `on(v12, v18)`, and thereby achieving `new-axiom@0()`. There is a `move_base` action, but it doesn't change the base configuration and isn't necessary, so I'll omit it for a more efficient plan.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', #o3) is not satisfied!`. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Impossibility of Reaching the Goal**
           
           Okay, so the previous plan failed, and it's clear why: the crucial precondition `atbconf(#o3)` wasn't met for the `pick` action.  Let's break this down.
           
           My initial state knowledge reveals a problem. I *know* about `#o3` (through `bconf(#o3)`) and the base motion (`basemotion(#o3, #o0, #o3)`), but crucially, I am *not* explicitly *at* any base configuration. The predicate `atbconf(?q: object)` is absent in the initial state, meaning, by definition, that the robot is not currently at any configuration. This is a significant issue.
           
           The `pick` and `place` actions both *require* `atbconf(#o3)`. My available action is `move_base`. But, to use `move_base #o3 #o3 #o0`, I *still* need to *already* have `atbconf(#o3)`. That action also requires that precondition! The system description is saying "any fact that isn't explicitly true, is false."
           
           This creates a deadlock. I can't `pick` or `place` without being `atbconf(#o3)`. I can't *become* `atbconf(#o3)` without already *being* `atbconf(#o3)` through a `move_base`. Even the `move_base` that would move me *to* my current configuration doesn't help because that action *also* requires I *start* at that configuration.
           
           I need a way to *establish* `atbconf` without a prior `atbconf`, or for `atbconf(#o3)` to be true in the initial state. But, it is not explicitly stated. The system is closed-world.
           
           Looking closely at all the available actions and preconditions, `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4` and `move_base #o3 #o3 #o0` both require the missing `atbconf(#o3)`.  The goal is therefore unreachable. No matter how many times I review the initial state facts or available actions, the result is the same: without the initial condition, the preconditions for all relevant actions cannot be satisfied, leaving the planning process in an impossible state.
