           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Breakdown and Action Plan for Goal Achievement**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunction of various state conditions. Essentially, I need to get images of three specific objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`), analyze one rock of type `v2` (stone), and analyze one rock of type `v6` (soil). My resources: two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, both equipped with a camera (`v10`) and storage.  Crucially, I have to ensure the storage units of both rovers are free at the *end* of the plan, and that the rovers are at their original starting configurations.
           
           **Initial Assessment:**
           
           Both rovers are initially at specific configurations and have free storage. The camera on both rovers supports the required mode (`v11`) for imaging. The targets are visible.
           
           **Action Plan:**
           
           I'll divide the tasks between the rovers for efficiency:
           
           **Rover `v12` (Image Acquisition and one analysis):**
           
           1.  **Move & Image (`v17`)**:
           
               *   Move to configuration  `c_v12_v17_img` (0.0, 0.0, 0.0), where `v12` can see `v17`.
               *   Calibrate Camera, point at target
               *   Take Image.
           
           2.  **Move & Image (`v18`)**:
               *   Move to configuration `c_v12_v18_img` (1.0, 1.0, 0.0), where `v12` can see `v18`.
               *   Calibrate Camera, point at target
               *   Take Image.
           
           3.  **Move & Image (`v19`)**:
               *   Move to configuration  `c_v12_v19_img` (-1.0, 1.0, 0.0), where `v12` can see `v19`.
               *   Calibrate Camera, point at target
               *   Take Image.
           
           4.  **Communicate**
           
               *   Move to configuration `c_v12_v9_com` (0.0, -2.0, 0.0)
               *   Send the images to `v9`
           
           5.  **Sample and Analyze**
               *   Move to `#o5` which isn't specified in image/communication predicates.
               *   Sample rock `v1`.
               *   Move back to `c_v12_v9_com`.
               *   Send the analysis of `v1`.
               *   Drop the sampled rock in `v12`'s storage.
               *   Return to `v13`.
           
           **Rover `v14` (Analysis):**
           
           1.  Move to `#o5`.
           2.  Sample rock `v5`.
           3.  Move to `c_v14_v9_com` (-1.0, -2.0, 0.0).
           4.  Send analysis.
           5.  Drop the sampled rock in `v14`'s storage.
           6.  Return to `v15`.
           
           **Addressing the Continuous Configuration Requirement:**
           
           The plan is designed to adhere to the given geometrical conditions, where the key is that `#o3` and `#o0` are given in the PDDL initial state, but they have multiple instances associated with different targets and rovers, which have separate and distinct configurations. To ensure clear communication and to adhere to prompt guidance, I provide the precise coordinates, which guarantees collision-free, reachable, line-of-sight configurations.
           
           `c_v12_v17_img`: (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)

Model:     **Strategic Breakdown and Action Plan for Goal Achievement**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunction of various state conditions. Essentially, I need to get images of three specific objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`), analyze one rock of type `v2` (stone), and analyze one rock of type `v6` (soil). My resources: two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, both equipped with a camera (`v10`) and storage.  Crucially, I have to ensure the storage units of both rovers are free at the *end* of the plan, and that the rovers are at their original starting configurations.
           
           **Initial Assessment:**
           
           Both rovers are initially at specific configurations and have free storage. The camera on both rovers supports the required mode (`v11`) for imaging. The targets are visible.
           
           **Action Plan:**
           
           I'll divide the tasks between the rovers for efficiency:
           
           **Rover `v12` (Image Acquisition and one analysis):**
           
           1.  **Move & Image (`v17`)**:
           
               *   Move to configuration  `c_v12_v17_img` (0.0, 0.0, 0.0), where `v12` can see `v17`.
               *   Calibrate Camera, point at target
               *   Take Image.
           
           2.  **Move & Image (`v18`)**:
               *   Move to configuration `c_v12_v18_img` (1.0, 1.0, 0.0), where `v12` can see `v18`.
               *   Calibrate Camera, point at target
               *   Take Image.
           
           3.  **Move & Image (`v19`)**:
               *   Move to configuration  `c_v12_v19_img` (-1.0, 1.0, 0.0), where `v12` can see `v19`.
               *   Calibrate Camera, point at target
               *   Take Image.
           
           4.  **Communicate**
           
               *   Move to configuration `c_v12_v9_com` (0.0, -2.0, 0.0)
               *   Send the images to `v9`
           
           5.  **Sample and Analyze**
               *   Move to `#o5` which isn't specified in image/communication predicates.
               *   Sample rock `v1`.
               *   Move back to `c_v12_v9_com`.
               *   Send the analysis of `v1`.
               *   Drop the sampled rock in `v12`'s storage.
               *   Return to `v13`.
           
           **Rover `v14` (Analysis):**
           
           1.  Move to `#o5`.
           2.  Sample rock `v5`.
           3.  Move to `c_v14_v9_com` (-1.0, -2.0, 0.0).
           4.  Send analysis.
           5.  Drop the sampled rock in `v14`'s storage.
           6.  Return to `v15`.
           
           **Addressing the Continuous Configuration Requirement:**
           
           The plan is designed to adhere to the given geometrical conditions, where the key is that `#o3` and `#o0` are given in the PDDL initial state, but they have multiple instances associated with different targets and rovers, which have separate and distinct configurations. To ensure clear communication and to adhere to prompt guidance, I provide the precise coordinates, which guarantees collision-free, reachable, line-of-sight configurations.
           
           `c_v12_v17_img`: (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)

           `c_v12_v19_img`: (-1.0, 1.0, 0.0)
           
           `c_v12_v9_com`: (0.0, -2.0, 0.0)
           `c_v14_v9_com`: (-1.0, -2.0, 0.0)
           
           Now that these configurations are set, I can proceed with the plan. All preconditions are met and all requirements of the axiom should be fulfilled.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **My Optimized Plan for Task Completion**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a complex scenario and a list of invalid configurations. My primary goal is to come up with valid, efficient configurations for the rovers (v12 and v14) to accomplish the given tasks.
           
           First, I had to identify the constraints: obstacle positions (v20, v21), starting positions of the rovers, and the locations of the targets (v17, v18, v19, and v9). I noted the communication and imaging ranges for the rovers.
           
           I've learned from previous attempts that the continuous configurations must be reachable from the rovers' current positions and collision-free. I spent a fair amount of time analyzing the geometry of the scene, particularly the placement of obstacles, to find configurations that satisfy these conditions and allow each rover to complete its tasks.
           
           I had to rethink my approach to make the best use of resources and the constraints of the system. I realized that v14 might be better suited for imaging and obtaining the image of v19. This balances the work and makes for a more efficient system overall.
           
           I've defined a clear division of tasks:
           
           *   **v12:** Image v17 & v18, communicate the images to v9, sample v1 rock, communicate analysis, then return to its starting position, v13.
           *   **v14:** Image v19, communicate the image to v9, sample v5 rock, communicate the analysis and return to its starting position, v15.
           
           The key to this plan is carefully selecting configurations that are:
           
           *   **Collision-free:** v12: (-0.3, 1.0, 0.0) for v17; (1.5, 1.0, 0.0) for v18; (-1.0, -2.0, 0.0) for v9.
           *   **Reachable:** The starting location of v12 is (1.0, -1.75). The path to v17 is 3.04 (approx). The path to v18 is 2.79 (approx). The path to v9 is 2.01 (approx). v14 location, its location is (-1.0, -1.75), which makes it a good candidate to work with for v19.
               *   Path to image v19 is 2.79
           *   **Within imaging range:** The distances are all within two units, the max range of an image.
           
           I made the plan in a clear sequence of actions and ensured all preconditions are met. The key to the plan is carefully selecting configuration points to avoid the vertical wall at x=0, and making sure to reach the required image point within 2.0.
           
           In the end, all the objectives in the problem should be met with this plan.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Addressing Robot Base Reachability Issues**
           
           The feedback highlights a critical issue: some continuous configurations are deemed "not reachable" by the robot base. This necessitates a re-evaluation of reachability from the initial states of the rovers, focusing on the moves from their initial positions to the target configurations required for imaging and communication.
           
           My initial assessment of the continuous values for the rovers' initial positions, v13 and v15, and their relationship to target imaging objectives like v17, v18, and v19, indicated significant distances and potential collision issues. The primary challenge lies in the presence of an obstacle (a wall) at x=0, which divides the environment and necessitates the rovers to potentially cross it for imaging or communication, or to reach configurations on the opposite side of the initial location.
           
           Given a likely constraint on maximum travel distance (perhaps around 2 meters for a single 'move' action), many proposed configuration assignments seemed infeasible. The error message's emphasis on "not reachable for robot base" suggests that, the distances between the initial configurations and the required "#oX" configurations (the intermediate configurations for actions) are too far, or that obstacles block direct paths.
           
           Addressing this, I've re-strategized: assigning tasks based on the rover's initial side of the wall. Rover v12, initially on the positive x side, would be responsible for tasks on this side and rover v14, on the negative x side, to handle corresponding task on its side. However, I must keep in mind, *all* images were required and therefore, there were several combinations where the rovers needed to move beyond their original sides.
           
           To find valid configurations, I considered:
           
           *   **Imaging range:** I determined the `imagevisible` constraints for each objective and the target configuration. The robot must get within 2m of the target when imaging.
           *   **Obstacle avoidance:** I considered all possible collisions for the intended route. It is critical the rovers do not move into the wall or other obstacles.
           *   **Reachable moves:** I kept in mind that, usually in this domain, a single action is not allowed to go beyond ~2 meters.
           *   **The initial and target configurations must be near the imaging objectives.**
           
           I then propose two primary tasks:
           
           1.  **Rover `v14`:** To image `v17` and `v19`, sample rocks, then communicate.
           2.  **Rover `v12`:** To image `v18`, then communicate.
           
           I then evaluate each potential configuration assignment and distance:
           
           *   For `v12` to communicate, a key element of the plan, it was necessary for v12 to find a `comvisible` location with the lander. The previously assigned configuration of `-1.0, -2.0` failed, as the distance (2.01 m) was beyond the reach limit. However, the configuration of `-0.1, -2.0` for communication was only 1.13 meters away, which is likely within the reach limit.
           
           **Conclusion**
           
           The main challenges are:
           
           *   Avoiding Obstacles while following paths between source, intermediate, and target configurations.
           *   Making sure the configurations follow distance parameters.
           *   That both `receivedimage` predicates occur.
           
           This refined plan attempts to optimize these moves with minimal required actions and collision free routes while meeting the overall system goals. The success depends on whether my assumptions are considered "reasonable" for reaching intermediate target configurations with maximum reach bounds.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **My Revisions and Justifications**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. We're looking at a revised plan because the first one for rover `v12` hit a snag - those pesky reachability and collision problems.  The core goals haven't changed: we're still after images from both rovers, analysis, and those final objective facts.  
           
           My approach hinges on being super precise with where `v12` is allowed to go. Originally, `v12` had a hard time getting close enough to `v18`.  The planner kept flagging it as "not reachable" from its starting point. Then the system suggested some intermediate motion waypoints `#o0` and the image config `#o3`. From the `motion` predicates, it was clear that a chained `v13 -> #o0 -> #o3` was the way to go.
           A very similar issue emerged when `v14` attempted to get to `v17`. To improve efficiency, it's very important to use intermediate configurations so that all moves are in the reachability range.  
           
           The issue *Configuration #o0 = (-0.1 -2.0 0.0) for rover v12 at target v9 is in collision with ... v20* was also critical. This means communication had some difficulties. So, to prevent it from reoccurring, I am using a new position for the communication between rovers and the lander `v9`.
           
           So, the new approach is using `#o0` and `#o3` explicitly as *context-specific* configurations. When I define a value for `#o0` to allow `v12` and `v9` to communicate, *that's* the `(-0.5, -2.0)` value. It's the same for `v14` to communicate with `v9`. So, even if the generic value of `#o0` is used generally in a motion planning, it must be the correct coordinate.
           
           So, the new structure:
           **v14 Plan:** `v15 -> #o0 -> #o3 ->  #o0_com`
           **v12 Plan:** `v13 -> #o0 -> #o3 -> #o0_com`
           The value for `#o0_com` is `(-0.5, -2.0)`.
           And the value for `#o3` depends on its use.
           
           Now the overall configurations used in this model are:
           *  `C_v12_intermediate` = (1.0, 0.0, 0.0) (intermediate for v12)
           *  `C_v12_v18_img` = (1.5, 0.5, 0.0)

Model:     **My Revisions and Justifications**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. We're looking at a revised plan because the first one for rover `v12` hit a snag - those pesky reachability and collision problems.  The core goals haven't changed: we're still after images from both rovers, analysis, and those final objective facts.  
           
           My approach hinges on being super precise with where `v12` is allowed to go. Originally, `v12` had a hard time getting close enough to `v18`.  The planner kept flagging it as "not reachable" from its starting point. Then the system suggested some intermediate motion waypoints `#o0` and the image config `#o3`. From the `motion` predicates, it was clear that a chained `v13 -> #o0 -> #o3` was the way to go.
           A very similar issue emerged when `v14` attempted to get to `v17`. To improve efficiency, it's very important to use intermediate configurations so that all moves are in the reachability range.  
           
           The issue *Configuration #o0 = (-0.1 -2.0 0.0) for rover v12 at target v9 is in collision with ... v20* was also critical. This means communication had some difficulties. So, to prevent it from reoccurring, I am using a new position for the communication between rovers and the lander `v9`.
           
           So, the new approach is using `#o0` and `#o3` explicitly as *context-specific* configurations. When I define a value for `#o0` to allow `v12` and `v9` to communicate, *that's* the `(-0.5, -2.0)` value. It's the same for `v14` to communicate with `v9`. So, even if the generic value of `#o0` is used generally in a motion planning, it must be the correct coordinate.
           
           So, the new structure:
           **v14 Plan:** `v15 -> #o0 -> #o3 ->  #o0_com`
           **v12 Plan:** `v13 -> #o0 -> #o3 -> #o0_com`
           The value for `#o0_com` is `(-0.5, -2.0)`.
           And the value for `#o3` depends on its use.
           
           Now the overall configurations used in this model are:
           *  `C_v12_intermediate` = (1.0, 0.0, 0.0) (intermediate for v12)
           *  `C_v12_v18_img` = (1.5, 0.5, 0.0)
           *  `C_v14_inter_img` = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0)
           *  `C_v14_v17_img` = (-0.5, 0.0, 0.0)
           *  `C_v14_v19_img` = (-1.5, 1.0, 0.0)
           *  `C_com` = (-0.5, -2.0, 0.0)
