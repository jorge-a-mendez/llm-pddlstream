           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Plan: Assessing the Feasibility of new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of how I'm approaching this planning problem. I need to figure out a sequence of actions to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom requires several conditions to be met simultaneously: I need to ensure a specific state is achieved where a conjunction of facts holds.
           
           First, I examined the initial state of the scenario. The initial checks showed that conditions related to the rovers being at their starting positions (`atconf`) and having free storage (`free`) are already satisfied. However, I have three *image* goals (`receivedimage`) and two *analysis* goals (`receivedanalysis`) to take care of.
           
           The `receivedimage` goals are the first point of concern. To fulfill these, I'd need to have my rovers (v12 and v14) both image specific objectives and send the captured images to the lander. I need to take the image, and *then* send it. This requires the rover to take the image, the lander to receive the image. To take the image, both the rover and target object must be visible to each other.
           
           To start with the image goals, the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates present a crucial challenge. Both rovers (v12 and v14) have the necessary equipment to capture the images, the same camera is *onboard* (v10). However, the critical issue lies in the geometric constraints defined by the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates, particularly the distances. I calculated the distances between the rovers at their initial configurations (v13 and v15) and the required objectives for imaging. The distances exceeded the maximum permissible viewing range (2 meters for imaging).  I *must* use rovers in their current configurations, or I would need the rovers to *move*.
           
           Here's the problem: The given actions only allow the rovers to perform *cyclic* movements – they are constrained by `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` or `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`.  This indicates that v13, #o2 and v15, #o2 are continuous configurations that can be *traversed*, but they are not target configurations. The rovers start at `v13` or `v15`, then transit to `#o2`, *and return* to their initial configuration. These movements *do not* change the position of the rovers to one in *range* with their targets. So the rovers will *not* be in a position to take pictures.
           
           The problem specifically says, I need to provide values for configurations that are needed (the ones starting with `#`). To fulfill distance contraints for *image*, I *must* *use* these configurations. The only solution is if `v13 == #o3` and `v15 == #o3`.  This implies that the *continuous* configurations where a rover must be able to view their target objects and communicate with their targets. The rovers must be in these configurations.
           
           Since the geometric constraints cannot be satisfied, it is not possible to achieve the `receivedimage` goals.
           
           Now, for the `receivedanalysis` goals, I need to have a rock *sampled* and *sent*. Thankfully, there are rocks and rovers already configured in close enough proximity that the `above` state is met. Furthermore, a specific `store` (v16) is free on each rover.
           
           I checked the distances: one set of rocks were close enough for the distance required to sample. I decided to send `v4` and `v7`, which is *possible*. The problem is that I cannot take *all* of the images (v17, v18, v19) using my rover.
           
           In short, the *analysis* aspect is achievable: I can select a rock that's close, send it to the lander. The *imaging* aspect is NOT achievable, because I can't place my rovers in *image range*.
           Since all conjuncts in the axiom are necessary to achieve the main goal, this means the overall goal `new-axiom@0()` is unachievable given the constraints and the provided action set. The plan is blocked.
