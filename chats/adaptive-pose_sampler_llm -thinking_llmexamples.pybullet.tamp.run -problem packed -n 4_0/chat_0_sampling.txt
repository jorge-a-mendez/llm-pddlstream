(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation for Square Object**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5) on a square surface (ID 0). The object is 0.09792 units on a side, making its half-side length `h` roughly 0.049. The surface is centered at (0,0) and extends from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           
           The key is that the object, when rotated, can still fit within this surface. Since the object is a square, its bounding box remains a square regardless of rotation. However, after rotating, its effective bounding box size will change. We need to account for this rotation and find where we can safely place the object's center (x, y).
           
           For a given rotation `theta`, I'll calculate the *effective* half-side length (`eff_half_s`) of the object's bounding box. This is given by `h * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This means as `theta` changes from 0 to pi/4, then the `eff_half_s` will also change, going from h to h*sqrt(2). The range is h.
           
           I'll pick a few distinct rotation angles, then create a grid of (x, y) positions for each angle within the allowed space on the surface. For theta=0, 25 points; theta=pi/8, 9 points; theta=pi/4, 9 points; 3pi/8, 9 points.
           
           The allowed range for the center (x, y) depends on `eff_half_s`. To keep the object contained within the surface, the center's x and y must be within `-0.135 + eff_half_s` and `0.135 - eff_half_s`.
           
           I carefully calculate `eff_half_s` for each chosen rotation. I calculate the allowed ranges. The total is greater than 50. Then I just pick the first 50.
           
           Here's the plan:
           1.  **Define object dimensions** and surface boundaries.
           2.  **Calculate** the bounding box extent based on rotation.
           3.  **Calculate valid ranges** for (x, y) coordinates on each surface, depending on `theta`.
           4.  **Create placements** within the valid ranges.
           5.  **Return a list of 50 placements** and explanations.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable and Collision-Free Placements for Object 4**
           
           Alright, here's the plan. I've got to place object 4 on surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into the already-placed object 5. Object 5 is snug in the bottom-left corner of the surface, which gives me some breathing room.
           
           First, I need to figure out object 4's boundaries for different rotations. I know object 4's dimensions, and for a rotation 'theta', I can calculate the effective size, which depends on 'theta'.
           
           Next, I'll need to calculate the bounding boxes for both objects. I'll need to make sure object 4 doesn't touch object 5. I calculated the allowed positions for Object 4 based on the size of the objects and ensuring they never overlap. I have now decided how I will select the x,y coordinates to ensure a good spread of placements.
           
           Then, I'll combine the positions for the object. I've planned out some strategies to make sure they're far enough apart to be stable and avoid any collisions. I am going to have 4 different thetas and a bunch of positions for each.
           
           I have selected the angle increments and now will generate the 50 object placements.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object 7: A Detailed Plan**
           
           I'm tasked with placing 50 stable instances of a new square object (ID 7) on Surface 0, a bounded region defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  The challenge lies in avoiding collisions with two existing, fixed obstacles: Object 5 (ID 5) and Object 4 (ID 4), whose AABBs I've calculated. My goal is to maximize the placement of Object 7 on the surface, whilst ensuring no overlap.
           
           My primary strategy revolves around establishing safe zones. The primary concern is placing Object 7 such that it does not overlap with the existing objects and is also contained on the surface. With no possible placement 'above' the surface, the solution is limited to right of the existing blocks.
           
           First, I calculate the `eff_h7`, which is a function of object size and angle of rotation. Based on these bounds, I determine the surface's valid x,y values.
           
           Second, I need to prevent collisions. I'll define an AABB for object 7. I know that if the new object can be placed to the right of the already placed objects (x> 0.008798), the generated placement will be valid.
           
           Since I am not dealing with complicated shapes, I will be prioritizing a clean sweep of generating coordinates. Since the surface is relatively small, I am prioritizing diversity in the `y` coordinates.
           
           I intend to use a set of `x_c` values as `[0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09]` (5 values).
           I intend to use a set of `y_c` values as `[-0.09, -0.07, -0.05, -0.03, -0.01, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09]` (10 values).
           This will provide `5 * 10 = 50` valid placements.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object 6 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 6) on surface 0, taking into account three fixed obstacle squares (IDs 5, 4, and 7). I must ensure the new object doesn't collide with these obstacles, and remains within the surface boundaries.
           
           **Constraints & Calculations:**
           
           *   **Surface:** Surface 0 is a square defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           *   **Obstacles:** Each obstacle has dimensions and a known position. The most important aspect is their AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box), which I have calculated. These AABBs define the regions the new object must avoid.
           *   **New Object (ID 6):** The new object is a square of size `(0.07567220754658877, 0.07567220754658877)`. I calculate its half-extent for use in collision checks and surface boundary checks.
           *   **Surface Containment:** The center of the new object must remain within the surface boundaries, considering its rotation (`theta`).
           *   **Collision Avoidance:** The AABB of the new object must not overlap with any of the obstacle AABBs.
           
           **Placement Approach:**
           
           1.  **Simplify and Analyze:** I started by visualizing the occupied space. After analyzing the obstacle positions, a `theta=0` approach seemed promising to place the object in regions that minimized intersections.
           
           2.  **Clear Channel Strategy:** I decided to find areas where the object could be placed without overlapping any obstacles. I defined 'clear channels' along the right vertical strip, where the object could be placed and clear of the bounding boxes. 
           
           3.  **Right Strip Placement:**
               By placing the center of object 6 to be `x>=0.0878`, then I could find `5x10=50` valid placements with no collisions.
           
           I'm confident these placements will satisfy the stability and collision-free requirements. The generated set gives 50 placements at `theta = 0.0`, with positions:
           
           X values: `[0.088, 0.090, 0.092, 0.094, 0.096]`,
