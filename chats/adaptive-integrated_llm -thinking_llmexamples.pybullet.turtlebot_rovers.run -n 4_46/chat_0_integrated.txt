           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Goal Assessment: The Unachievable Axiom**
           
           Okay, here's the situation as I see it, from the perspective of an expert in this domain: I'm tasked with devising a plan to achieve the goal state defined by `new-axiom@0()`. This goal is complex, demanding that several conditions be simultaneously true.  I've broken down the conditions, and I see that many are already satisfied in the initial state – the rovers are in their starting configurations and have stores available.  However, four key conditions are *not* met initially: `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` for images and analyses, respectively.
           
           My initial thought was to use the rovers, `v14` and `v12`, to fulfill these requirements. I imagined a straightforward plan: take images of the objectives, analyze rocks, and then send the data. I started mapping out the actions: calibrate the camera, take images, send images, sample rocks, analyze them, and send those analyses. I went through the motions to prepare each part of the plan.
           
           However, a serious obstacle emerged. The problem explicitly lists only two actions I can use: `move` and `drop_rock`. Crucially, it forbids the use of actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`—the very actions *needed* to satisfy the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` conditions! These predicates are only set to true by sending data, which I'm *not* allowed to do, since the requisite actions aren't listed.
           
           This is a complete dead end. The problem's constraints directly contradict the goal. The goal necessitates actions I can't use. Therefore, despite my best efforts to strategize, and re-read the entire prompt looking for even a small, clever workaround, the goal is simply unattainable with the tools provided. It's a fundamental conflict between the defined goal and the restrictions on allowable actions. There is no plan that can satisfy the prompt as written.
