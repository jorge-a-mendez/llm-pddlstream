           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0. The object is a square with side length `0.0885`. Surface 0 is a square area defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           Since the object is square, its orientation (theta) doesn't matter for its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box). Rotating it will give the same AABB.  So, I'll set `theta = 0` for all placements, simplifying things.
           
           The key is determining the valid range for the object's center coordinates (x, y). The object's half-width and half-height are both `0.04425`.  To be fully contained within the surface, the center of the object must lie within a smaller square.  I calculate the valid range for x and y: `[-0.09074, 0.09074]`.
           
           To generate 50 unique placements, I'll use a 7x7 grid within this valid range, which will give me 49 placements. The x and y coordinates are generated by evenly dividing the x and y ranges. Each step will be approximately `0.0302`. I'll also add one point to obtain 50 total placements.
           
           The 50 placements will be based off of the grid, plus a new point `(0.01, 0.01)`. The coordinates will be the ones that are calculated using the 7x7 grid: I will generate the list of `(0, 0, x_grid, y_grid)` and add the extra point. The final results should look like `(0, 0, 0.01, 0.01)` and the grid, where `(0,0)` is inside the grid and therefore is a valid point.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 8 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've got a new request: find 50 stable locations for object ID 8 on Surface 0, taking into account the existing object, ID 5. This object is essentially a square, so I can keep the rotation simple, at zero.
           
           First, I need to define the safe placement area for object 8 on Surface 0. Surface 0 is a square region. I can easily calculate the valid range for the center coordinates (x_8, y_8) by considering the half-dimensions of the object and the surface extents. Now, here's the trick: I need to consider object 5. Its AABB is located in the bottom-left corner of the surface, touching the surface boundaries.
           
           To avoid a collision, the AABBs of objects 8 and 5 must *not* overlap. To make sure this stays true, I'll calculate the safe *relative* distance between their centers.  To avoid collision, Object 8's center has to be located at least one combined half-extent away from Object 5's center. Considering the half-extents and the safe ranges, I can determine the safe range for the center of object 8.
           
           Essentially, I'll carve out an exclusion zone around the existing object, ensuring object 8 doesn't overlap it. This exclusion zone leaves me with a smaller, rectangular "safe zone" for object 8. With that established, I will generate a grid of 7x7 points, totaling 49 points. I'll add one more point to make it 50. I'll take a grid approach with a calculated x-step and y-step, based on the dimensions of the safe rectangular region. These points will be the final positions, now that I've calculated the x and y ranges. Let's get this done.

(Thoughts: **Initial Placement Strategy for Object 7 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable positions for a new, square-shaped object (ID: 7) on Surface 0, ensuring it doesn't collide with previously placed objects (ID: 5 and ID: 8).  I began by defining the object's dimensions and calculating the valid surface area on Surface 0, taking into account object 7's half-extents.
           
           I determined the valid range for the center of object 7 on Surface 0 to be approximately [-0.09645, 0.09645] for both x and y coordinates. Then, I needed to incorporate collision avoidance with the existing objects.
           
           I calculated collision exclusion zones by inflating the AABB of the existing objects by object 7's half-extents. These collision zones define areas where the center of object 7 cannot be placed.  I then calculated these exclusion zones precisely and redefined the valid ranges for object 7's placement to exclude these collision zones.
           
           To solve this, I generate a 10x10 grid of potential placement points across the surface and applied the collision conditions to exclude any points within those calculated forbidden rectangular collision zones. I then generated my candidate points with a Python grid and applied filters to see if any points were in conflict with object 5 and 8's collision regions. This process successfully generated a set of 66 possible points. I selected the first 50 stable positions for object 7.

(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for Object 4 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. I've got to find 50 stable spots for this new square object, labeled ID 4, on a surface.  The surface has these bounds: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I've calculated that the object's half-dimensions are about 0.04 each. Since the object is square, I can use a rotation of `theta = 0.0`.
           
           First, I need to figure out the region on the surface where I *can* place the object, considering its size. That's straightforward: I just add the object's half-size to the lower bounds and subtract it from the upper bounds. That gives me a valid area.
           
           Now, here's the trickier part: avoiding collisions with existing objects! I have to dodge three other objects already on the surface: IDs 5, 8, and 7. I have the center coordinates and half-sizes for each of these. I need to calculate the *forbidden* regions around each existing object where my new object *can't* go. This means I have to calculate the sum of the half-widths and half-heights of the new object and each existing one, and then add this sum to each object's respective coordinates, to check the AABB for collision avoidance.
           
           Since I have the coordinates of all existing objects, I know the center of each forbidden zone. I'll need to calculate for each existing object the bounds of its region where object 4 will collide: the sums of the half dimensions are needed. From this, the valid region for the placement can be deduced for x and y, considering the surface bounds.
           
           Given the existing objects and a rectangular surface, the safest route is to use a grid search to avoid collisions. I'll create a 9x9 grid within the valid surface range and test each grid point against the collision conditions using my collision detection function (essentially comparing distances to the objects' centers and half-widths). If any point on the grid results in a collision, that spot is removed from the solution set.
           
           I'll iterate and check the collision conditions with these existing objects. I will start with a grid approach, then filter out the colliding points. I'm going to set up a loop to efficiently check all generated points against each of the collision criteria. I'll filter the points that are safely away from existing objects, then collect the solution set. I'll do this and collect the locations where there's no collision with existing objects. I have to collect at least 50 valid points.
           
           Once I have 50 or more unique safe placements, I'll stop. I just have to make sure my code is working properly to identify the collision-free coordinates! The main task is to create the AABB collision for all existing objects, using the pre-calculated intervals. Then, for each generated placement, check if it's within those bounds using the collision conditions, defined earlier. If none are met, it's a valid placement!

(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable positions for object 6 on surface 0, making sure to avoid collisions. I know the dimensions of object 6 (it's basically a square with sides of about 0.082 units), and I have the surface boundaries (-0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y).  First, I'll calculate the valid region where I *could* place object 6, ignoring collisions for now. This involves shifting the surface boundaries inward by half the object's width to get the inner "safe" rectangle.
           
           Then, I'll identify the existing objects (IDs: 5, 8, 7, and 4) and their positions. For each existing object, I calculate the combined "radius" (actually half-extents, since these are rectangles) of the two objects along both the x and y axes. A collision happens if the distance between the *centers* of two objects is less than the sum of their half-extents in each direction.
           
           To generate possible placements, I'll create a grid of points within the surface's valid region. I'll test each grid point to see if it collides with any of the existing objects. The first 50 valid, non-colliding points I find will be the placements I return. To speed this up, I'll precompute the sums of half-extents for each object pair. I'm using a 10x10 grid, which I'm confident should be enough to find 50 valid placements without having to resort to random or edge-based solutions. After testing a few cases using the collision logic, the grid-search seems valid. Let's run it.

After testing a few cases using the collision logic, the grid-search seems valid. Let's run it.
