           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **I need to provide 50 stable placements for an object on a given surface.** The object is a square (ID 4) with sides of approximately 0.0757 units, and the surface is also a square centered at (0, 0) with sides of 0.270 units, or extending from -0.135 to 0.135 along both the x and y axes. Because both the object and surface are square, the object's orientation (`theta`) relative to the surface plays a critical role in its placement, despite the surface being the same, a square. The relevant dimension is the width of the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB). The geometry of the object is defined by the x and y dimensions. The prompt requires the placement of 50 objects and each placement is described by a tuple: `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`. The prompt refers to the rotated dimensions of the axis-aligned bounding box (AABB), so to determine whether a given placement is stable, I need to know how the AABB size is affected by theta rotation. The dimensions are identical (`s_x = s_y`), and because of the dimensions the rotated bounding box width `W = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))` and height `H` will always be equivalent. It is important to know the boundaries of the AABB as the position needs to be within the surface dimensions. For a given placement (surf_idx, theta, x, y), the placement will be considered stable if surf_idx equals 0. The object's rotated AABB must be within the bounds of surface 0, and therefore, the bounds need to be checked relative to the position of the center point (`x`, `y`) by evaluating whether `-0.135 + W/2 <= x <= 0.135 - W/2` and the same for `y`. I need to generate 50 unique placements. I should systematically vary the values of the angles. The object must remain on surface 0 and I will consider some different rotations, for example angles such as `0, pi/12, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, 5pi/12, pi/2`, and then select position values within the ranges for x and y.

(Thoughts: **My Placement Strategy for Object ID 5, Avoiding Collision with Object ID 4**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to place object ID 5, a square, on surface 0 without it bumping into object ID 4, which is already sitting there pretty snugly, and is another square. We know where object 4 is: centered at (-0.097, -0.097) with a size of 0.0757. I've already calculated its Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) which spans roughly from (-0.135, -0.135) to (-0.059, -0.059), right in that bottom-left corner of the surface.
           
           Object ID 5, it turns out, is a slightly bigger square with a side length of 0.09338. The surface itself is a square of 0.27 x 0.27, extending from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           So, the game plan is:
           
           1.  **Figure out the Valid Placement Range:**  For object 5, depending on its rotation (theta), the AABB side will change.  Maximum AABB side occurs when at 45 degree rotation, so the maximum width of object 5 is `0.09338 * 1.4142 = 0.132066`.  The range is  `[surface min + W5/2, surface max - W5/2]`.
           
           2.  **Account for Collision with Object 4:** The real challenge is avoiding that bottom-left corner where object 4 is. I know the AABB for object 4, which is approximately from (-0.135, -0.135) to (-0.059, -0.059).  So, I need to make sure my candidate center coordinates for object 5, which translate to its AABB, don't intersect this area.
           
           To avoid these collisions, I'll calculate `W5` at multiple thetas in this range: `[0, pi/12, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, 5*pi/12, pi/2]`
           
           Then, I'm generating a few placement candidate points (x, y) at each `theta`. To avoid any collision, I will compare, for a certain candidate point and theta, the object 5 AABB with object 4, and check for an intersection.
           
           I have found a set of valid `(x,y)` combinations for each of thetas to place object 5.

(Thoughts: **Scene Analysis and Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. I've been given a task: place object ID 7 on surface 0, making sure it doesn't collide with objects ID 4 and ID 5 that are already there. It's a constrained packing problem, which, frankly, I've seen before. The surface is a square centered at (0,0), specifically bounded by ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). I need to find a suitable location (x, y) and rotation (theta) for object 7.
           
           Object 7 is a square with a known size (`s7`). I've precalculated the AABBs for the existing objects (AABB_4 and AABB_5) based on their extents, rotation, and position, which makes the collision checks quicker. They're located in the bottom-left of the surface.
           
           My strategy? It's pretty straightforward. I'm going to follow the established workflow:
           
           1.  **AABB Calculation:** For each candidate angle (theta), I'll calculate object 7's AABB.  The formula for the bounding box width is `W = s7 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.
           2.  **Valid Surface Containment:** I'll determine the valid (x, y) ranges within surface 0 where object 7's AABB can be fully contained, based on the `W`.
           3.  **Collision Detection:** I'll check for overlaps between object 7's AABB (for a given position and theta) and the AABBs of objects 4 and 5. Standard AABB overlap tests will be used.
           4.  **Diverse Placement Generation:** I'll explore a few angles – 0, pi/12, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, 5*pi/12, and pi/2. For each, I'll generate a grid of positions within the valid region.
           
           However, since objects 4 and 5 are clustered in the bottom-left, I suspect many placements there will collide. I'm going to optimize the grid position generation loop: I will prioritise placements in the top-right, top-left and bottom-right areas, and fill the list until it reaches 50 valid placements.
           
           In addition, I'll preload AABB values for efficiency in collision checks, and I'll calculate `W` ahead of the loops to avoid calculation overhead.
           
           Also, I have ensured the logic for collision checks and range determination for x and y.
           
           I will proceed to use these techniques and generate a list of 50 non-colliding positions (x, y, theta) for the object ID 7.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object ID 8 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 8) on surface 0, avoiding collisions with three existing objects (ID 4, 5, and 7).  This involves a methodical process of calculating potential placement positions and rigorously checking for overlaps.
           
           **Understanding the Constraints:**
           
           Surface 0 is a square with an extent of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  I have precise bounding box information for the three existing objects, enabling precise collision detection.  Object 8 is a square with side length 0.0795...; its orientation and position will determine its final AABB.
           
           **Calculating Feasible Placement Regions:**
           
           The fundamental strategy involves calculating the AABB of object 8 for a given rotation (theta) and center point (x, y) then checking for overlap with the AABBs of objects 4, 5, and 7.  The AABB size, W, is calculated as `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This means the surface containment requires a check on the center coordinates (x, y) to make sure `x_min_allowed <= x <= x_max_allowed` and `y_min_allowed <= y <= y_max_allowed`.
           
           **Collision Detection Logic:**
           
           For a robust approach, my collision detection strategy will check for overlaps between the AABBs of Object 8 and the known AABBs of the existing objects.  The crucial overlap criterion is as follows: `(O8_lx < O4/5/7_ux && O8_ux > O4/5/7_lx) && (O8_ly < O4/5/7_uy && O8_uy > O4/5/7_ly)`.
           
           **Sampling the Placement Space:**
           
           To comprehensively cover various orientations and locations, I plan to sample the rotation space with 7 evenly-spaced angles from 0 to pi/2 (0, pi/12, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, 5*pi/12, pi/2).  For each rotation, I will discretize the surface-contained region into a 4x4 grid of (x,y) coordinates within the allowed ranges.  I will iterate to cover the entire space.
           
           **Prioritizing Unoccupied Space:**
           
           The spatial reasoning gives me an opportunity to improve the search. I want to prioritize the regions less likely to be occupied. Given the existing placements, the bottom-left and top-right are partially occupied. Therefore I will attempt to place Object 8 in the middle and top-left/bottom-right regions first. Within the grid search, I will arrange the `(x, y)` iteration to prioritize these areas.

Model:     **Strategic Placement of Object ID 8 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 8) on surface 0, avoiding collisions with three existing objects (ID 4, 5, and 7).  This involves a methodical process of calculating potential placement positions and rigorously checking for overlaps.
           
           **Understanding the Constraints:**
           
           Surface 0 is a square with an extent of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  I have precise bounding box information for the three existing objects, enabling precise collision detection.  Object 8 is a square with side length 0.0795...; its orientation and position will determine its final AABB.
           
           **Calculating Feasible Placement Regions:**
           
           The fundamental strategy involves calculating the AABB of object 8 for a given rotation (theta) and center point (x, y) then checking for overlap with the AABBs of objects 4, 5, and 7.  The AABB size, W, is calculated as `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This means the surface containment requires a check on the center coordinates (x, y) to make sure `x_min_allowed <= x <= x_max_allowed` and `y_min_allowed <= y <= y_max_allowed`.
           
           **Collision Detection Logic:**
           
           For a robust approach, my collision detection strategy will check for overlaps between the AABBs of Object 8 and the known AABBs of the existing objects.  The crucial overlap criterion is as follows: `(O8_lx < O4/5/7_ux && O8_ux > O4/5/7_lx) && (O8_ly < O4/5/7_uy && O8_uy > O4/5/7_ly)`.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement for Object ID 6**
           
           My primary goal is to determine 50 stable locations for a new object (ID 6) on surface 0, taking into account the existing objects to prevent any collisions. Surface 0 is a square, centered at (0, 0), with bounds (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           I've carefully examined the positions and bounding boxes (AABBs) of the existing objects (IDs 4, 5, 7, and 8) to understand the occupied space. This analysis provides the foundation for my placement strategy. The current scene configuration shows that the bottom-left and top-right sections are already largely occupied.
           
           My approach is to calculate the object's width (W) at different rotations (theta) from 0 to pi/2, then calculate its allowed center range based on the surface bounds. A key element is preventing collisions, accomplished by verifying that the candidate object AABB does not overlap with any of the existing objects.
           
           I am developing the candidates by considering 7 different angles for placing the object. I create a 4x4 grid of potential placement locations for each rotation. I have a function that checks for AABB intersection. I am generating positions in a way to favor finding clear spaces.
           
           I am using precise calculations for AABB bounds and using them in collision checks. The algorithm first explores the right/center and bottom/center regions.
           
           Since existing objects are currently clustered in the bottom-left and top-right, the remaining areas (top-left, bottom-right, and central regions) appear to be good candidates. I will be checking these zones, and I have found the current placement strategy effective. I will prioritize placements that avoid collisions and aim to find 50 stable positions.
