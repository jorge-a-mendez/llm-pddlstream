           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27. The object is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0825 x 0.0825. I need to find 50 stable placements for this object on the given surface. Since the object is much smaller than the surface, there's a large area for stable placements. I will try to distribute placements across the surface, varying both position and orientation. For a square object, rotating by 90 degrees (pi/2 radians) doesn't change its effective footprint.
           
           The object's half-extents are `0.08248684328031929 / 2 = 0.041243421640159645` and `0.08248684328031924 / 2 = 0.04124342164015962`.
           The surface extends from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           For the object to be fully contained, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           `surface_lower_x + object_half_x <= x <= surface_upper_x - object_half_x`
           `-0.135 + 0.041243421640159645 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.041243421640159645`
           `-0.09375657835984035 <= x <= 0.09375657835984035`
           The same range applies to y.
           
           I will generate placements by dividing the available x and y ranges and varying the orientation.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains the single square surface (0.27 x 0.27) centered at the origin.
           Now I need to place a new object, ID 6, which is also square with dimensions approximately 0.0922 x 0.0922.
           I also know that object ID 5 was successfully placed at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). I must avoid collision between object 6 and object 5.
           
           Object 6 half-extents: `0.09215937005178804 / 2 = 0.04607968502589402`.
           The surface extends from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           For object 6 to be fully contained, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           `surface_lower_x + object_6_half_x <= x <= surface_upper_x - object_6_half_x`
           `-0.135 + 0.04607968502589402 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.04607968502589402`
           `-0.08892031497410598 <= x <= 0.08892031497410598`
           The same range applies to y.
           
           Object 5 is at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Its half-extents are approximately 0.0412.
           This means object 5 occupies the region `[-0.0412, 0.0412]` in both x and y.
           To avoid collision, object 6 must be placed such that its bounding box does not overlap with object 5's bounding box.
           For simplicity, and since both objects are square and axis-aligned, I can place object 6 just outside the bounding box of object 5.
           
           For example, I can place object 6 at `x = object_5_half_x + object_6_half_x + small_gap`.
           `x = 0.041243421640159645 + 0.04607968502589402 + 0.001 = 0.08832310666605367` (approximately 0.088)
           This x value is within the allowed range for object 6 (max 0.0889).
           
           I will place object 6 to the sides of object 5, and in the corners.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene remains the same single square surface.
           I need to place a new object, ID 4, which is square with dimensions approximately 0.0895 x 0.0895.
           I have two previously placed objects:
           - Object 5: (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) with half-extents approx 0.0412. It occupies `[-0.0412, 0.0412]` in x and y.
           - Object 6: (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0) with half-extents approx 0.0461. It occupies `[0.08 - 0.0461, 0.08 + 0.0461] = [0.0339, 0.1261]` in x and `[-0.0461, 0.0461]` in y.
           
           Object 4 half-extents: `0.08947335745676283 / 2 = 0.044736678728381415`.
           The surface extends from -0.135 to 0.135.
           For object 4 to be fully contained, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           `-0.135 + 0.044736678728381415 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.044736678728381415`
           `-0.09026332127161858 <= x <= 0.09026332127161858`
           The same range applies to y.
           
           I need to find placements for object 4 that avoid both object 5 and object 6.
           Current occupied space (approximate AABBs):
           Object 5: `x: [-0.0412, 0.0412], y: [-0.0412, 0.0412]`
           Object 6: `x: [0.0339, 0.1261], y: [-0.0461, 0.0461]`
           
           Notice that object 5 and object 6 overlap in x. Object 6 starts at 0.0339, which is inside Object 5's right edge at 0.0412. Wait, Object 6's placement `(0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0)` for a previous request passed, meaning it did not collide with fixed obstacles. This means the bounding boxes I calculated for the non-fixed obstacles (which are now fixed) are actually what I should use.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the collision between 5 and 6 if they were placed as given by the previous success:
           Object 5 (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. Half-extents: `(0.04124, 0.04124)`. AABB: `x: [-0.04124, 0.04124], y: [-0.04124, 0.04124]`.
           Object 6 (ID: 6) -- 0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0. Half-extents: `(0.04608, 0.04608)`. AABB: `x: [0.08 - 0.04608, 0.08 + 0.04608] = [0.03392, 0.12608]`, `y: [-0.04608, 0.04608]`.
           These two AABBs clearly overlap. The x range for object 5 ends at 0.04124, and the x range for object 6 starts at 0.03392.
           Since the placement of object 6 (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0) was a success, it must not have collided with object 5 (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) at the time it was placed. This implies that the 'fixed obstacles' that are being reported are not necessarily all previous objects. However, the problem statement says "if you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j." This means I *must* avoid collisions with previously placed objects.
           
           This discrepancy indicates a possible misunderstanding of "fixed obstacles" vs "previously placed objects". If the success reports imply no collision with previously placed objects, then perhaps the system is checking object-object collisions implicitly and reporting only if they fail.
           
           Given the explicit instruction "you must avoid collision between objects i and j", I will strictly avoid overlap with objects 5 and 6 based on their AABBs at their reported successful placements.
           
           Revised occupied space:
           Object 5 (ID: 5): AABB `x: [-0.04124, 0.04124], y: [-0.04124, 0.04124]`.
           Object 6 (ID: 6): AABB `x: [0.03392, 0.12608], y: [-0.04608, 0.04608]`.
           
           Combined occupied X range: `[-0.04124, 0.12608]` (this is the union of the X intervals, not a single contiguous block, but useful for understanding the general occupied zone).
           Combined occupied Y range: `[-0.04608, 0.04608]`
           
           This means a large portion of the surface center is occupied.
           I need to find space for object 4 (half-extents 0.04474).
           The stable placement range for object 4 is `x: [-0.09026, 0.09026], y: [-0.09026, 0.09026]`.
           
           Let's try placing object 4 in the negative x region, away from both object 5 and 6.
           Minimum x for object 4: `-0.09026`.
           If I place object 4 at `x = -0.09026`, its AABB would be `x: [-0.09026 - 0.04474, -0.09026 + 0.04474] = [-0.135, -0.04552]`. This range does not overlap with Object 5's x range `[-0.04124, 0.04124]`.
           Also, to avoid collision in Y, if I place it at `y = 0.09026`, its AABB would be `y: [0.09026 - 0.04474, 0.09026 + 0.04474] = [0.04552, 0.135]`. This y range does not overlap with object 5's or object 6's y range.
           So, `(-0.09, 0.09)` seems like a good corner to start from.
           
           Let's rethink the overlap. The problem statement says "if you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene." and "if you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j".
           This implies that my understanding of collision avoidance between previously placed objects is correct. If the system reports success for object 6 at (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0) when object 5 is at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), then the collision detection of the system must be different from simple AABB overlap, or perhaps the 'fixed obstacles' it refers to are distinct from other movable objects that have been placed.
           However, I will strictly follow "you must avoid collision between objects i and j". So, I *must* avoid the reported AABB for object 5 and 6.
           
           Given the apparent overlap of Object 5 and Object 6 according to my AABB calculations, and the fact that they were both successful, there's a contradiction.
           Option 1: The success reports are the ground truth, meaning Object 5 and 6 are not colliding as perceived by the system. My AABB calculations for collision avoidance might be too conservative, or there's an implicit clearance.
           Option 2: The system's "fixed obstacles" don't include other "placed objects", and I'm supposed to only avoid the fixed obstacles initially defined or learned. But the problem explicitly states to avoid collision between 'i' and 'j'.
           
           I will proceed by assuming my AABB calculations for collision avoidance between objects are correct and the success reports are based on the system's internal definition of "collision". If my placements fail, it means my AABB assumptions are correct about object-object collision. If they pass, it means they avoided collision according to the system's rules.
           
           For now, I will assume the previous 'successes' were indeed non-colliding (even if my geometric intuition suggests overlap), and generate placements for object 4 that avoid *my calculated AABBs* of object 5 and 6. This implies:
           Object 5 (ID: 5): `x: [-0.04124, 0.04124], y: [-0.04124, 0.04124]`
           Object 6 (ID: 6): `x: [0.03392, 0.12608], y: [-0.04608, 0.04608]`
           
           Let's try placing object 4 far from these two regions.
           Max x for object 4: 0.09026. Max y for object 4: 0.09026.
           Placing object 4 at `x = -0.07`, `y = -0.07`.
           Object 4 AABB at `(-0.07, -0.07)`:
           `x: [-0.07 - 0.04474, -0.07 + 0.04474] = [-0.11474, -0.02526]`
           `y: [-0.07 - 0.04474, -0.07 + 0.04474] = [-0.11474, -0.02526]`
           This AABB does not overlap with Object 5 or Object 6. This should be a valid placement.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene is still the single square surface.
           I need to place a new object, ID 7, which is square with dimensions approximately 0.0984 x 0.0984.
           I have three previously placed objects:
           - Object 5 (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. Half-extents: `(0.04124, 0.04124)`. AABB: `x: [-0.04124, 0.04124], y: [-0.04124, 0.04124]`.
           - Object 6 (ID: 6) -- 0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0. Half-extents: `(0.04608, 0.04608)`. AABB: `x: [0.03392, 0.12608], y: [-0.04608, 0.04608]`.
           - Object 4 (ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, -0.07, -0.07. Half-extents: `(0.04474, 0.04474)`. AABB: `x: [-0.11474, -0.02526], y: [-0.11474, -0.02526]`.
           
           Object 7 half-extents: `0.09841070390146255 / 2 = 0.049205351950731275`.
           The surface extends from -0.135 to 0.135.
           For object 7 to be fully contained, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           `-0.135 + 0.049205351950731275 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.049205351950731275`
           `-0.08579464804926872 <= x <= 0.08579464804926872`
           The same range applies to y.
           
           I need to find placements for object 7 that avoid objects 5, 6, and 4.
           Let's consider the free space.
           Object 5 is roughly central.
           Object 6 is to the right of central-right.
           Object 4 is in the bottom-left corner.
           
           Combined occupied regions (approximate):
           - Object 5: `x: [-0.0412, 0.0412], y: [-0.0412, 0.0412]`
           - Object 6: `x: [0.0339, 0.1261], y: [-0.0461, 0.0461]`
           - Object 4: `x: [-0.1147, -0.0253], y: [-0.1147, -0.0253]`
           
           The overlap between Object 5 and Object 6's X ranges `[0.0339, 0.0412]` and Y ranges `[-0.0412, 0.0412]` is still present according to my strict AABB calculation, but the system reported both as successful. I will continue to assume my interpretation of "avoid collision" means strict AABB non-overlap, and if a placement passes despite my calculation of overlap, it means the system's definition is looser.
           
           Let's look for a quadrant that is relatively empty.
           The top-right quadrant `(x > 0, y > 0)` seems to have the most free space.
           The top-left quadrant `(x < 0, y > 0)` might also have space, as Object 4 is bottom-left, Object 5 is central, and Object 6 is right.
           
           Let's try the top-right corner.
           Maximum possible x for object 7 is `0.08579`. Maximum possible y for object 7 is `0.08579`.
           Try `(0.08, 0.08)`.
           Object 7 AABB if placed at `(0.08, 0.08)`:
           `x: [0.08 - 0.0492, 0.08 + 0.0492] = [0.0308, 0.1292]`
           `y: [0.08 - 0.0492, 0.08 + 0.0492] = [0.0308, 0.1292]`
           
           Checking for collision with existing objects:
           - vs Object 5 ([-0.0412, 0.0412], [-0.0412, 0.0412]): No overlap in X or Y.
           - vs Object 6 ([0.0339, 0.1261], [-0.0461, 0.0461]): X overlap `[0.0339, 0.1261]` and `[0.0308, 0.1292]`. Y no overlap `[-0.0461, 0.0461]` and `[0.0308, 0.1292]`. So, no collision.
           - vs Object 4 ([-0.1147, -0.0253], [-0.1147, -0.0253]): No overlap in X or Y.
           
           So, `(0.08, 0.08)` looks like a good candidate.
