User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with dimensions approximately 5x5, centered at (0,0). There's a vertical wall (obstacle 5) in the middle along the y-axis, dividing the room into two halves. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered around, some of which seem to form patterns like rows of small squares (obstacles 7-10, 19, 20) or a "corridor" in the bottom half. I will generate positions by considering a circle of radius 2 around the target point and try to pick points that are not too close to the obstacles, especially the central wall. I'll prioritize positions with a good line of sight to the target point, and that are within the allowed x and y ranges.
           
           Positions:
           (-0.76 -0.1)
           (0.5 0.2)
           (0.2 0.0)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     My previous attempts failed because I didn't properly account for obstacle 5, the central vertical wall ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)). The target point (1.84, 2.06) is on the right side of this wall, so any valid base position must also be on the right side (x > 0.05) to have a line of sight. My proposed positions (-0.76, -0.1), (0.5, 0.2), and (0.2, 0.0) were either on the wrong side or too close to the wall (0.2, 0.0 collided with it). I also need to consider the other obstacles on the right side, specifically obstacles 7, 9, 12, 16, 19, 20. I will try to place the robot to the right of the central wall, and slightly to the south or north of the target to avoid obstacles like 7, 9, 19, 20 that are near the target.
