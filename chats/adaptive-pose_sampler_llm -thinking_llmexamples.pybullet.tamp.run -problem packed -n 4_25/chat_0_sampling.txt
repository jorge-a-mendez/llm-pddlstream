(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement for Stable Object Positioning**
           
           My goal is to generate 50 stable placements for an object with ID 4, defined by extents of `(0.08243415923565367, 0.08243415923565367)`, essentially a square, on surface 0, which is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`, another square centered at the origin.
           
           The critical factor is that for a stable placement, the object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) must remain entirely within the surface's AABB.  Since the object is a square, its effective width and height are constant (`0.08243415923565367`).  Therefore, I calculate the valid range for the object's center `(x, y)` on the surface.  This translates to ensuring that the object's edges don't extend beyond the surface's boundaries. The valid x range is approximately `[-0.09378, 0.09378]`, and the same applies to the y range.
           
           To generate 50 stable placements, my strategy is to distribute these placements evenly within this valid range.  I've decided on a 7x7 grid (49 placements), covering the valid area.  For each grid point, I'll use a `theta = 0` value, and then select a final placement at the center, with a different angle such as `pi/4` (45 degrees), to ensure diversity. Because the object is a square, the angle won't affect the calculations, as the object's AABB remains unchanged regardless of its rotation.  The result will be a list of 50 placements in the required format: `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`. The complete list of placements will be the result of a loop that calculates all the values, and the list will then be returned to the caller.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 5 (Square Object)**
           
           Alright, here's my plan for placing object ID 5 on surface 0, given that object ID 4 is already positioned at `(0, 0.0, -0.09378292038217316, -0.09378292038217316)`.  The goal is to avoid collisions, particularly with object ID 4. We know ID 5 is also a square, with dimensions `0.09740546701350966 x 0.0974054670135096`.  Surface 0 itself is bounded by  `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           First, I need to define the safe area for object 5. Its half-size is `0.04870273350675483`. This means the center of object 5 can move between -0.086297 and 0.086297 in both X and Y directions.
           
           Next, I need to understand where object 4 is occupying space.  Object 4's dimensions are `0.08243415923565367 x 0.08243415923565367`.  I've already calculated its bounding box: `[-0.135, -0.052565840764346325]` in both X and Y.  The center is clearly at the given coordinates.
           
           To avoid collisions, I need to make sure the AABBs don't overlap.  The combined half-extents are `0.08991981312458166`.  This means the center of object 5, `C5`, must be at least `0.08991981312458166` units away from object 4's center.  Specifically, the forbidden region for object 5's center is  [-0.09378292038217316 - 0.08991981312458166, -0.09378292038217316 + 0.08991981312458166] which is equivalent to  (-0.183702, -0.003863).
           
           However, the valid range for the center of O5 is constrained by the surface bounds: `[-0.086297, 0.086297]`.   The collision region (overlap between the safe range and the forbidden ranges) is [-0.086297, -0.003863). So, if either the X or Y coordinate is in that overlapping range, there will be a collision!  So, one strategy is to make sure x OR y is outside of  [-0.086297, -0.003863).
           
           My strategy: Since I need to generate 50 non-colliding placements, I will create a grid. First, I would take the center position of `(0.0, 0.0)` for no collision. So I will create an 8x8 grid of positions, avoiding the forbidden coordinates. I will filter the positions from -0.086297 and 0.086297 for both X and Y, and place the square object there if and only if there's no collision with object 4. I will take the center coordinates and check to ensure that the coordinate is non colliding. I will then pick `(0.0, 0.0)` as well to ensure there are no collision in that area also. With this positioning, and a step to ensure the 50 valid placements for the square objects, no collisions will occur, and I am satisfied with the positioning.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement on Surface 0: A Detailed Strategy**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 7) on Surface 0, taking into account fixed obstacles. Here's my thought process:
           
           **1. Object and Surface Details:**
              - Object 7 is a square with known dimensions. Its half-extents are calculated for collision checks.
              - Surface 0 has defined bounds, creating a valid area for placement.
           
           **2. Calculating Valid Center Coordinates:**
              - I determined the valid ranges for the object's center (x, y) on the surface, ensuring the object is fully contained. This gives a rectangular region.
           
           **3. Obstacle Considerations (Object 4 & 5):**
              - The coordinates and extents of fixed obstacles (Objects 4 and 5) are defined.
           
           **4. Collision Detection using AABB:**
              - For each obstacle, I calculated the forbidden region within the valid surface range using the Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) approach. AABB is a quick check to see if there is potential for collision, but not a final say.
              - The collision condition is based on if the center of the new object is inside the forbidden region.
              - I refined the calculations.
           
           **5. Creating a Placement Grid:**
              - I'll create a 10x10 grid of candidate placement points within the valid surface bounds. I calculate the step size.
           
           **6. Collision Check Iteration:**
              - I'll then iterate through each grid point and explicitly check for collisions with both obstacles using my `is_colliding` function.
              - Points outside the valid surface range are invalid.
           
           **7. Compiling Non-Colliding Placements:**
              - I will store all the non-colliding (valid) placement coordinates in a list, keeping a count along the way to see if there are at least 50.
              - At the beginning of the placements list I add additional rotations for variety. However, for a square they are the same placements as the object's AABB does not change.
           
           **8. Results and Output:**
              - I expect to find enough valid placements to meet the requirement.
              - I will output the first 50 non-colliding points as my final set of stable placements.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning:**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've been tasked with placing 50 instances of Object 6, a small square, onto Surface 0, making sure they don't collide with three existing objects already there: Object 4, Object 5, and Object 7. Since I'm working with an AABB collision system, it's pretty straightforward.
           
           First, I define the valid area on Surface 0 where Object 6's center can be. I calculate the boundaries by subtracting Object 6's half-extent from the surface's edges. Then, I calculate and identify the forbidden zones (the areas occupied by the other three objects) by using the AABB.  I've got the centers and half-extents of the other objects, so it's a matter of checking if an Object 6 would be overlapping any of the other AABBs.
           
           The tricky part is defining a grid of points within the valid area, and efficiently checking those points against the collision zones, and making sure I can find 50 valid spots. I'm going to start by making a smaller grid to check my strategy, then switch to the larger 16x16 grid.
           
           To be sure that all the positions are accounted for, I’ll construct a grid of candidate center points within the surface's boundaries. I'll test each point to check for overlaps. A 10x10 grid is not enough and fails, and 16x16 grid will provide a good sample of the free space. I'll then filter out any points that fall within these collision areas. Finally, I’ll pick the first 50 valid points from my list to meet the requirements of my goal.
