           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           My primary objective is to devise a plan to satisfy the requirements of `new-axiom@0()`. This demands I achieve several sub-goals: successfully acquire and transmit images (specifically those identified as `v17` and `v18`) and obtain and transmit analyses for rocks. The actions needed involve taking images, sending them, sampling rocks, and then transmitting the analysis results. The critical constraint is that only a very limited set of actions are permitted in the plan - actions that basically keep the rovers stationary.
           
           **Understanding the Constraints**
           
           The initial state provides several key conditions: the rovers (`v12`, `v14`) are at specific configurations (`v13`, `v15`), respectively. The allowed actions are simple 'move' actions (which basically equate to no-ops here, keeping the rovers where they are) and a 'drop_rock' actions. It is crucial to note that no other action is permitted for the plan.
           
           **Identifying the Bottleneck**
           
           My preliminary analysis shows that the rovers are initially situated at configurations (`v13`, `v15`) that are distinct from those needed for the core activities like communications and sampling (`#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`). The permitted 'move' actions, unfortunately, are not powerful enough to relocate the rovers to these key configurations.
           
           **Implications of the Constraint**
           
           The restricted action set severely limits the capabilities. Because the rovers cannot move to the configurations where they can perform the necessary actions, none of the individual steps to achieve the goal will be possible. For example, to take a picture, the rover would need to be in the `imagevisible` configuration and we know it's stuck in `v13` or `v15`. A sampling action requires the rover is `above` a rock, which is a different configuration. And, the same applies to communication.
           
           **Final Conclusion**
           
           Based on this, it's my conclusion that, given the strict constraints on the actions, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently unachievable, because the rovers cannot move to the necessary states to complete the image taking and analysis sending requirements.
