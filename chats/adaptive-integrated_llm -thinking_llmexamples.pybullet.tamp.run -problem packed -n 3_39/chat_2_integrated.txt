User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.272, -0.045), (-0.201, 0.026)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.161, -0.54), (0.234, -0.467)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.236, -0.009, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.006, -0.449), (0.085, -0.37)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.198, -0.504, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.695, 0.719).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.046, -0.409, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.07, 0.998).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've devised to move the three objects onto the target surface, based on the initial state and goal:**
           
           My primary goal is to get v8, v12, and v14 all stacked on v16.  This requires me to pick each one up from its current location (v9, v13, and v15, respectively) and place it onto v16.  The available moves are a `move_base` action and `pick` and `place` actions that use arm v4. All pick and place require the robot to be at a specific base config (#o3) which is different from the initial base config (v3).  The key is that the new positions on v16 are represented by a variable `#o2`.
           
           **Here's the step-by-step approach I came up with:**
           
           1.  **Move Base:** I'll begin by moving the robot base from its initial configuration (v3) to the necessary base configuration (#o3) so that I can use the pick and place commands. This uses the `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` command.
           2.  **Pick v8:**  I'll pick up v8 from its current position (v9) using the command `pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4`.
           3.  **Place v8:** I'll place v8 onto surface v16 at the position I've designated, represented by `#o2_for_v8` using the command `place v4 v8 #o2_for_v8 #o1 #o3 #o4`.
           4.  **Pick v12:** I'll pick v12 from its location (v13):  `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4`.
           5.  **Place v12:** I'll place v12 on v16, which is using a unique location on surface #o2_for_v12: `place v4 v12 #o2_for_v12 #o1 #o3 #o4`.
           6.  **Pick v14:** Pick v14:  `pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4`.
           7.  **Place v14:** Place v14 using surface #o2_for_v14 and: `place v4 v14 #o2_for_v14 #o1 #o3 #o4`.
           
           **Key Considerations:**
           
           *   **Continuous Poses:** The problem requires me to provide continuous values for the #o2 poses for each object when placing them on v16 because they are present in initial facts. I've selected a unique set of continuous values for each object on v16 to avoid collisions.  These positions are near the center of v16, at a consistent height.  Each object also needs a distinct `#o2_for_v8`, `#o2_for_v12` and `#o2_for_v14`, which is equivalent to #o2 for the objects.
           *   **Collision Avoidance:**  I've selected placement positions on v16 that are clearly distinct and within the bounds of the target surface v16 to minimize any risk of collision.  I am relying on the absence of explicit collision-avoidance predicates (`unsafeapproach`, `unsafepose`) in the preconditions of `kin` actions to ensure these are collision-free.
           *   **Move Base Action:**  I must move base to config #o3 to perform pick and place actions.
           *   **Cost Minimization:**  I'm assuming the move base cost is minimal. Leaving robot at #o3 will save the cost of moving back to v3.
           
           In summary, my plan focuses on sequentially picking each object, moving to a base pose, and carefully placing it on the target surface v16, while ensuring no collisions using a carefully selected placement strategy.
