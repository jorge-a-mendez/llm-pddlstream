User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.198, -0.504, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.695, 0.719).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.161, -0.54), (0.234, -0.467)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.046, -0.409, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.07, 0.998).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.236, -0.009, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.006, -0.449), (0.085, -0.37)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.272, -0.045), (-0.201, 0.026)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching the Unreachable: A Critical Analysis**
           
           Okay, so I've got a goal: get v8, v12, and v14 stacked *on* v16. Simple enough, in theory. But the initial state throws a wrench in the works. My "arms" (v4, v6) are empty, the base config (v3) is static, and my target objects (v8, v12, v14) are all nestled on v11.  Crucially, I have this limited action set:  `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  That's it. Nothing else allowed.
           
           My initial thought was to use the `#o2` continuous parameter with `pose` facts for each object `on v10` and `on v16`. This suggests there's a spatial component to the placement.  I've got grasps defined too: `grasp(v14, #o1)`, `grasp(v8, #o1)`, `grasp(v12, #o1)`,  using `#o1` as a continuous grasp parameter.
           
           But the available action, `move_base`, is a dead end. I need to be able to pick up and place these objects. That's how you satisfy the `on` predicates! I dug into the PDDL specifics:  `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)` are the crucial predicates. The goal requires *all* three objects on v16:  meaning each `supported(?, ?, v16)` and corresponding `atpose(?,?)`.
           
           I went back and checked the facts. v8, v12, and v14 are currently *on* v11, *not* v16. And here's the kicker: The `atpose` facts, which are essential for defining an object's position, can only be changed by the `pick` and `place` actions, which are *not* provided in my action instance list.  Without these actions, the objects *remain* in their initial `atpose` states.
           
           Thus, based on the `move_base` action definition, `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, it's clear the goal is impossible. This action doesn't allow me to move the target objects *at all*. The *negated* effects on `canmove()` make it even more obvious. It's essentially a no-op! No movement. No chance of satisfying the `on` goal. There's no way to manipulate those objects. This problem is fundamentally unachievable given the constraints.  The only thing I can do is move the base, and that won't get me anywhere.
