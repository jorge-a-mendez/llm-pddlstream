User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.272, -0.045), (-0.201, 0.026)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.161, -0.54), (0.234, -0.467)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.236, -0.009, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.006, -0.449), (0.085, -0.37)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.198, -0.504, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.695, 0.719).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.046, -0.409, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.07, 0.998).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Atom kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable Due to Action Instance Restrictions**
           
           My initial assessment focused on creating a plan to achieve the goal of placing objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto surface `v16`. I recognized the need for `pick` and `place` actions to move these objects, starting from their initial positions on surface `v11`.  The plan naturally unfolded: pick each object, move it to pose `#o2` on `v16`, and place it.
           
           However, a critical constraint emerged. The problem explicitly limits the available action instances to `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This restriction became the focal point.  The problem statement clearly states that only *provided* action instances can be used. My expertise and experience instantly flagged this as a potential issue, requiring careful consideration.
           
           To formalize this further, I inspected the preconditions and effects of my available action and found that it made `atbconf(v3)` false, which is a needed precondition for the `kin` facts relating to picking/placing. This further solidified the need for `pick` and `place` actions, which were not provided in the valid action list. I then reviewed all axioms and knowledge around the `on` axiom that is my final goal, and it requires `atpose` in all cases. I realized I was not able to use a trick or axiom to arrive at the goal.
           
           The only way to reach the desired state is with `pick` and `place`, which are not available. This is a clear indicator that a solution is not possible.
           
           Thus, based on a rigorous interpretation of the given constraints, the goal is definitively unachievable. The provided action instance list lacks the necessary operations to manipulate the objects and fulfill the specified goal. The core issue is the complete absence of `pick` and `place` actions in the allowed instances.
