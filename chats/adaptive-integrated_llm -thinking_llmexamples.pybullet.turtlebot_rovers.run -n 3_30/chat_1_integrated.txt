           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **A Plan to Achieve new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective, `new-axiom@0()`, boils down to getting images of three things (v17, v18, v19) and analyses of a rock and some soil.
           
           The rovers on the scene are v12 and v14. They both have a camera (v10) that can take the needed images and storage space (v16).  v12 and v14 start in known locations with v12 at v13 and v14 at v15.
           
           To capture the images, I need to calibrate the camera and then take the picture, which then requires sending the data back to the lander (v9). I'll use v12 for all image-related actions. To send the images and the analysis, I need to get to the correct positions.
           
           Then, there is the analysis part. I'll need to sample and send analysis for a rock, type v2 (rocks v1, v3, or v4), and soil, type v6 (soil v5, v7, or v8). I'll choose to sample rock v1 and soil v5.
           
           So, the tasks are:
           *   **Step 1:** Get v12 to the right imaging position.
           *   **Step 2:** Calibrate and take images of v17, v18, and v19.
           *   **Step 3:** Move to the sample position.
           *   **Step 4:** Sample rock v1 and soil v5.
           *   **Step 5:** Move to send position.
           *   **Step 6:** Send all the collected data.
           
           Here's the detailed plan:
           
           1.  **Move**: Move rover v12 from v13 to #o3 (image location).
           2.  **Calibrate**: Calibrate the camera (v10) for image v17.
           3.  **Take Image**: Take image v17, which needs mode v11.
           4.  **Calibrate**: Re-calibrate the camera (v10) for image v18.
           5.  **Take Image**: Take image v18.
           6.  **Calibrate**: Re-calibrate the camera (v10) for image v19.
           7.  **Take Image**: Take image v19.
           8.  **Move**: Move rover v12 from #o3 to #o5 (sample location).
           9.  **Sample**: Sample rock v1 with rover v12. Store v16 will be full then.
           10. **Drop**: Drop the rock, emptying the store.
           11. **Sample**: Sample soil v5. Store v16 will be full then.
           12. **Drop**: Drop the soil, emptying the store.
           13. **Move**: Move rover v12 to #o0 (communication/sending location).
           14. **Send Image**: Send image of v17 to the lander.
           15. **Send Image**: Send image of v18.
           16. **Send Image**: Send image of v19.
           17. **Send Analysis**: Send rock analysis to the lander.
           18. **Send Analysis**: Send soil analysis.
           
           The trickiest part is determining the values for #o0 and #o3. These should be good communication and image taking positions, respectively, and collision-free. After considering the given AABB values, I am setting #o0 to (0.0, -2.0, 3.14) and #o3 to (-1.0, 1.0, 1.22).
           
           With this sequence, I can successfully achieve the desired goal, `new-axiom@0()`.

           Then, there is the analysis part. I'll need to sample and send analysis for a rock, type v2 (rocks v1, v3, or v4), and soil, type v6 (soil v5, v7, or v8). I'll choose to sample rock v1 and soil v5.
           
           So, the tasks are:
           *   **Step 1:** Get v12 to the right imaging position.
           *   **Step 2:** Calibrate and take images of v17, v18, and v19.
           *   **Step 3:** Move to the sample position.
           *   **Step 4:** Sample rock v1 and soil v5.
           *   **Step 5:** Move to send position.
           *   **Step 6:** Send all the collected data.
           
           Here's the detailed plan:
           
           1.  **Move**: Move rover v12 from v13 to #o3 (image location).
           2.  **Calibrate**: Calibrate the camera (v10) for image v17.
           3.  **Take Image**: Take image v17, which needs mode v11.
           4.  **Calibrate**: Re-calibrate the camera (v10) for image v18.
           5.  **Take Image**: Take image v18.
           6.  **Calibrate**: Re-calibrate the camera (v10) for image v19.
           7.  **Take Image**: Take image v19.
           8.  **Move**: Move rover v12 from #o3 to #o5 (sample location).
           9.  **Sample**: Sample rock v1 with rover v12. Store v16 will be full then.
           10. **Drop**: Drop the rock, emptying the store.
           11. **Sample**: Sample soil v5. Store v16 will be full then.
           12. **Drop**: Drop the soil, emptying the store.
           13. **Move**: Move rover v12 to #o0 (communication/sending location).
           14. **Send Image**: Send image of v17 to the lander.
           15. **Send Image**: Send image of v18.
           16. **Send Image**: Send image of v19.
           17. **Send Analysis**: Send rock analysis to the lander.
           18. **Send Analysis**: Send soil analysis.
           
           The trickiest part is determining the values for #o0 and #o3. These should be good communication and image taking positions, respectively, and collision-free. After considering the given AABB values, I am setting #o0 to (0.0, -2.0, 3.14) and #o3 to (-1.0, 1.0, 1.22).
           
           With this sequence, I can successfully achieve the desired goal, `new-axiom@0()`.
           

User:      Configuration #o0 = (0.0 -2.0 3.14) for rover v12 at target v9 is in collision with the following fixed obstacles:
           
           ```
           v20: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1))
           ```
           
           Configuration #o3 = (-1.0 1.0 1.22) for rover v12 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Revising Configurations for Rover v12**
           
           The previous plan was hampered by a collision with configuration `#o0` and the unreachability of `#o3`.  I need to find new continuous values for these configurations, specifically targeting `rover v12`.
           
           For **configuration `#o0` (comms with `v9`)**, I'm aiming for `(-1.0, -2.0, 3.14)`. This avoids the collision with `v20` (a wall at x=0), and positions `v12` close to `v9` at (-1.9, -2.0) for good communication range (within 4 units).
           
           For **configuration `#o3` (imaging `v17`, `v18`, `v19`)**, I’m going with `(-1.0, 2.0, 1.0)`. This point is central to the image objectives, meeting the 2-unit range requirement for each.  The previous attempt,  `(-1.0, 1.0, 1.22)` was flagged as unreachable; this new location is more accessible and still meets the proximity condition.  I’ve set the orientation at 1.0 radians to point towards the general area of objectives, which suits all imaging requirements. The plan is valid because `#o3` is required to image all three, and I can't use individual points. I've also verified that this location isn't in a collision with the wall.
           
           The entire sequence involves moving the rover, using the images, collecting samples, then sending the information. This configuration plan makes sure that everything works within range for these actions to be successful.

Configuration #o3 = (-1.0 2.0 1.0) for rover v12 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Rethinking Reachable Configurations**
           
           Okay, so I need to find new, reachable, collision-free, and occlusion-free configurations for rover `v12`, since the previous attempts for configurations `#o0` and `#o3` weren't working. The goal is to achieve the state `new-axiom@0()`, which means a few things must be true: `v12` must end up back at its initial position (`v13`) and `v14` at `v15`, the store for each rover must be free, I need to receive images of three targets, and I must receive analyses of two rock samples.
           
           Since `v12` is the active rover, I need to focus on finding appropriate configurations for it. It's currently at `v13`, with its camera `v10` and in mode `v11`. The lander `v9` is at a specific location, and I need to communicate with it.
           
           For **Configuration `#o3` (Imaging)**, the purpose is to image three targets (`v17`, `v18`, and `v19`). My constraints are to be within 2.0 units of the targets, avoid collisions, and be reachable from `v13`. I've calculated that a configuration like `(-0.5, 1.5, 1.57)` would be suitable. It’s close enough to the targets, and importantly, it avoids the wall obstacle (`v20`). Based on the initial problem definition, reachability will be guaranteed by the planner.
           
           For **Configuration `#o0` (Communication)**, my goal is to communicate with the lander `v9`. I need to be within 4.0 units, avoid collisions, and be reachable. I'm choosing `(-1.0, -2.0, 3.14)` as a potential configuration, which is near the lander and, again, is collision-free.
           
           Here’s the thing: while `conf(v12, #o5)` is in the initial state, `#o5` is not used in the plan. I don't need to provide a specific value for `#o5`. But it is important to remember that `motion` predicates in the initial state like `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)`, `motion(v12, #o3, #o2, #o5)`, and `motion(v12, #o5, #o2, #o0)` are crucial and indicate that these paths exist and are valid. My task is to pick a concrete value for `#o0` and `#o3` that is physically reasonable (collision-free, within range of targets, and generally 'reachable' in a real-world sense from the previous configuration).
           
           Based on these analyses and constraints, my plan will be to:
           1.  Move to `#o3` (imaging)
           2.  Take images of all three targets.
           3.  Move to `#o5` (sampling).
           4.  Sample and drop rock `v1`.
           5.  Sample and drop rock `v5`.
           6.  Move to `#o0` (communication).
           7.  Send the images and analysis data.
           8.  Finally, move back to the start location `v13` to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` goal.
           
           I've double-checked all the collision checks against all obstacles, and everything looks good. I made sure that there would be a movement back to the start state, which was the missing piece to satisfy the goal. This plan should work and be complete.

Model:     **Rethinking Reachable Configurations**

I'm choosing `(-1.0, -2.0, 3.14)` as a potential configuration, which is near the lander and, again, is collision-free.

User:      Configuration #o0 = (-1.0 -2.0 3.14) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (-0.5 1.5 1.57) for rover v12 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Rover Configuration Reachability and Occlusion-Free Imaging**
           
           My primary concern is the "not reachable for robot base" feedback for the configurations I've provided. This likely stems from a mismatch between my chosen (x, y, theta) coordinates and the robot's physical constraints or environmental interactions. The core issue revolves around ensuring both that the robot can *physically* reach these points and that the resulting image views are free from occlusion, particularly given a prominent wall in the scene.
           
           I have to carefully analyze the robot's kinematics and the map geometry, primarily focusing on the wall `v20`, which presents a potential physical barrier. The `motion` predicates in the PDDL initial state indicate direct movements between a set of configurations (`v13`, `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`). If any coordinates for `#o0` and `#o3` are "not reachable", my (x,y,theta) value must be bad.
           
           First, I looked at the bounding boxes (AABBs) to understand the geometry of the scenario, specifically the potential obstacles, and the rover positions. The rover's initial position is `v13 (1.0, -1.75, 3.142)` on the positive X side. The wall `v20` is at `x = 0`. I have to analyze the best coordinate choices for `v12` to satisfy the constraints. The primary constraints are "collision-free", "reachable," and "occlusion-free."
           
           A key challenge is the fact that the rover needs to image three objectives that lie on both sides of the wall. This implies that my plan must allow the robot to see both sides of the wall for the image visibility constraints.  The `imagevisible` predicates state that the targets `v17, v18, v19` can all be seen from the *same* `#o3`, meaning there *must* exist a feasible configuration. This single point must be capable of viewing across the wall or be placed in such a way to be close to both. I must satisfy all three of `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)`. If all targets can be seen, I need to place the rover somewhere where there is no physical blockage, otherwise, there is no line of sight.
           
           Assuming the wall is not "invisible", then `x` for the rover cannot have a value between `(-0.05, 0.05)`.  This helps me choose a value for `x`. If I want the rover to see across a barrier, the `y` value is also important. I must also consider the `theta` or orientation.
           
           I considered a path that kept the rover on one side of the wall only for some actions, which led to a conflict with `imagevisible` constraints. The wall cannot be opaque or the problem is not solvable. It also is important to consider if the camera can have vision *over* the wall. Then, all three targets can be visualized. Then, the problem could be within the range.
           
           After multiple attempts and reasoning, I have decided to consider values that are not too large and should be closer to the targets so there will be no issues with range.
           
           So I chose `#o3` at `(-0.6, 1.5, 1.57)` and `#o0` at `(-0.6, -1.5, 3.14)`. These coordinates were chosen to be close to the initial position and in a reasonable position that can view the targets.
           
           These coordinates, I hope, will lead to a successful plan that fulfills the "reachable" and "occlusion-free" constraints, and satisfy the requirements of the task.

(Thoughts: **A Shift in Perspective: Understanding the Rover's Capabilities and the Problem's Core**
           
           Initially, the previous plan was rejected because the requested configurations were unreachable for the robot. The issue wasn't just physical obstacles, but likely path planning constraints. The objective remains: to efficiently image, communicate, and sample while navigating a scene with a restrictive wall.
           
           Crucially, the interpretation of the continuous parameter (denoted by "#") was adjusted. Each (rover, target) pair can now have its own unique configuration associated with the common symbolic configurations, which were represented by `#o3`.
           
           For `v12`, the plan involves moving to an imaging configuration for target `v17`, followed by a sampling configuration for the stone rock. From there it returns to the starting position for communication. `v12` is tasked with imaging and communication from the positive x-side. `v12` will image `v17`, sample `v1`, and communicate from its starting point.
           
           `v14` on the other hand starts from the negative x-side. It will image `v18` and `v19`, sample `v5`, and communicate from its starting position.
           
           This approach should alleviate the reachability constraints.

(Thoughts: **Revised Strategy and Analysis of Rover Configurations**
           
           Alright, let's break this down again. I'm facing a tough nut to crack – a set of new errors indicating that some of the configurations I've laid out are "not reachable". This is a significant problem, as it implies there's something fundamentally blocking the planned movements, and I need to figure out *why*.
           
           Here's the situation: We're trying to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which relies on satisfying several conditions, including the rovers being at certain locations (`atconf`), having clear paths to designated targets (`free`), and receiving images and analyses (`receivedimage`, `receivedanalysis`).
           
           My initial plan was to divide and conquer, with rover `v12` handling tasks on the positive X side and rover `v14` on the negative side. This seemed like a robust strategy to get around the central obstacle.
           
           Now, I'm getting reports of "not reachable" errors. This is my prime concern. "Not reachable" could be due to a whole range of issues: being too far away from the intended target, an obstacle that I haven't explicitly noted, or some internal limitation of the path planner I'm using. My immediate task is to figure out what's causing these errors.
           
           The main issue is that `v12` is tasked with the image of `v17` at `(0.5, 1.9)` and `v14` with the imaging of `v18` and `v19` with target positions at relatively high y values. That is, the current coordinates require high y movement from the starting positions. This is where the issues are.
           
           Let me break down these problems systematically, using the plan:
           *   I will first try to put configurations within 2 range units to the target.
           *   I can put the `theta` `0.0` for sampling, `1.57` to image visible targets and `3.14` to perform a "no-op" and communication function.
           
           **Rover v12 plan:**
           *   **Move:**
               *   I need to check for path blocking. The paths are made by the `motion` predicates.
               *   Move from `(1.0, -1.75)` to image `(0.5, 1.9)`.
               *   Coordinates are `(0.6, 0.0, 1.57)` and for (1.6, 1.0, 0.0)
           *   **Sampling and Communication:**
               *   Sampling point. For the rover to sample is `(1.6, 1.0)`.
               *   The `0.8, -1.5, 3.14` configuration is used.
           
           **Rover v14 plan:**
           *   **Move:**
               *   I need to check for path blocking. The paths are made by the `motion` predicates.
               *   Move from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to image to `( -1.2, 1.0, 1.57)`.
               *   Coordinates for sampling are: `(-1.7, -0.3, 0.0)`
               *   `(-0.9, -1.75, 3.14) ` to communicate with `v9`.
           
           My hope is that I can use the same code, the same starting parameters and configuration, and just by modifying theta and a few other locations, I can obtain a suitable solution for this problem.
