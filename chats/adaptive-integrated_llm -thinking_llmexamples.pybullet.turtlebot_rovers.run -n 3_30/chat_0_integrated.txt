           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Unattainability Analysis**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of this. The goal is to get images and analyses to the lander.  Looking at `new-axiom@0()`, I need to get three images and analyze a stone and some soil. That's straightforward enough.  I've got two rovers, v12 and v14, both starting in a 'true' state for `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` respectively.  They're both free, and I have the usual suspects: rocks, objectives, communication and image modes.  So far, so good.
           
           Now comes the *real* challenge: finding a way to actually achieve the preconditions of the actions that will achieve the goal. I trace through the action preconditions, from image capture and transmission, all the way back to calibration and above all else, *position*.  Crucially, I need those rovers to be *at* certain configurations (`#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`) to take images, sample rocks, and send data.
           
           Here's the problem: The given actions only have one possibility to *move*: `move v12 v13 #o2 v13` and the same for rover v14. They're both stuck, effectively.  The only `motion` facts I have only let them *stay* in the same config.
           
           I have these 'visible' predicates - `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` - but they only apply to the `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` configurations, not the initial ones (`v13` and `v15`). And the plan says explicitly that facts that aren't in the initial state are false.  So, I can't *make* these rovers occupy the right configurations.
           
           This means I can't get past those first crucial preconditions.  Neither `take_image` nor `sample_rock` are even viable because of the lack of proper `above`, or `imagevisible` preconditions with `atconf(v12,v13)`, since the moves *do* not change the state of `atconf`.
           
           Basically, with the current action list and initial state, it's a dead end. I cannot devise a working plan. The goal is provably unreachable given the constraints.
