User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.075, -0.387, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.831, 0.556).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.167, -0.457), (0.251, -0.373)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.156, 0.272, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.405, 0.914).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.209, -0.415, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.119, 0.993).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.121, -0.433), (-0.029, -0.342)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.107, 0.222), (0.206, 0.321)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Alright, here's my plan to stack those three objects on the table, breaking down my thought process.**
           
           The main goal is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`. They're all currently on `v11` at different poses, and I need to move them to the surface `v16`. Since I have two arms, I'll use arm `v4`.  I need to pick each object and place it onto `v16` in the *same* pose.
           
           *   **Problem:** The AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) dimensions provided for the objects seemed problematic at first. They looked like the current world coordinates, and the y coordinates exceeded the allowable values for v16. However, the AABB description is given as dimensions, the dimensions and the given coordinate ranges show the placement is possible!
           *   **A-ha!** This means I can place them. I will need to be careful to ensure they fit within the bounds of `v16` so they are fully stable.
           *   **The Big Picture:** I will be using `pick` and `place` actions repeatedly, always with the same poses relative to the table surface.
           *   **Getting Started:** I need to make sure I'm at the correct base configuration (`#o3`). If I'm not, I'll need to move there first with `move_base`. It looks like that base configuration is needed for the robot to execute all those moves.
           *   **The Strategy:** For each object, I'll `pick` it up from its current location, and then `place` it onto the target surface `v16` at its appropriate pose `#o2`. I need to ensure all the poses will fit.
           *   **Pose Selection:** To fit the objects I'll use the surface `v16` coordinates to arrange them side by side. I will carefully place them in an arrangement that will allow the surface to have a stable support for the objects.
           *   **Collision Detection:** I need to ensure that the chosen poses avoid collisions during placement. I will check that the ranges of each object in each dimension do not intersect with those of the other objects after moving them to their new poses.
           *   **Step by Step Plan:**
           
               1.  `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)` (If the base configuration is different, move there. Otherwise, skip this step.)
               2.  `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
               3.  `(place v4 v8 (#o2 v8 v16) #o1 #o3 #o4)` (I'll define the specific pose for #o2 when placing v8, based on the coordinates that I worked out)
               4.  `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
               5.  `(place v4 v12 (#o2 v12 v16) #o1 #o3 #o4)` (Repeat, now for v12)
               6.  `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
               7.  `(place v4 v14 (#o2 v14 v16) #o1 #o3 #o4)` (Repeat, now for v14)
           
           *   **Final Thoughts:** This plan makes sure I move everything to the right place.
