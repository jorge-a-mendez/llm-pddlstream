User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.075, -0.387, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.831, 0.556).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.167, -0.457), (0.251, -0.373)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.156, 0.272, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.405, 0.914).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.209, -0.415, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.119, 0.993).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.121, -0.433), (-0.029, -0.342)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.107, 0.222), (0.206, 0.321)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning to Place Objects on a Surface**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: get three objects (`v8`, `v12`, and `v14`) onto surface `v16`, specifically at poses where they are supported by `v16`.  They are currently all on `v11`. I see that the robot's arm, `v4`, can handle this, with the kinematically feasible actions.
           
           First, I need to understand the constraints. Object `v16` is a surface (based on the fact `supported(v14, #o2, v16)`) and has an AABB. It has three distinct poses.  I'll need to generate a valid *pose* on this surface for each object that is within the AABB of v16. I can use the provided initial states to get their current positions. Also I am provided the bconf for the base configuration (`v3`) is fixed, so I'll be using the existing objects and configurations. The poses will be placed with the same *z-value*.
           
           Now for the plan!
           
           Since the robot arm starts `handempty`, it is able to pick, so I can start immediately with the first pick. The actions are: pick object from the current state (pose), put it on the table (surface) `v16`. Since I need to place three objects on the table, I will *place* them in a sequence.
           
           The first step is to pick up `v8`, from its current pose `v9`. I'll place it on the surface at a new pose,  I will need to set a position on the table that is not currently being used. Then I do the *place* action to put the object on `v16`.
           
           The same will be done for `v12`. I need to generate an new pose which is not currently occupied. The I take the *place* action.
           
           Repeat for `v14`. I need to generate an new pose which is not currently occupied, and I will place the object on surface `v16`.
           
           Since the robot arm is `handempty` after each place action, I can immediately pick up the next object. After the place action `v4` will be `handempty` for the next pick and the previous object is on table `v16`.
           
           The *move_base* actions and configurations are set, so I will take them as given. The base stays at position *v3*.
           
           Okay, let's nail down the continuous parameters for the plan (The values): I will assign new positions `#o2_v8`, `#o2_v12`, and `#o2_v14` on `v16` such that these values meet the constraints.
           
           Plan:
           
           1.  Pick `v8`
           2.  Place `v8` at the designated pose
           3.  Pick `v12`
           4.  Place `v12` at the designated pose
           5.  Pick `v14`
           6.  Place `v14` at the designated pose
           
           These *place* actions meet the goal. The cost is the number of steps. That's 6. And that's that.

I'll need to generate a valid *pose* on this surface for each object that is within the AABB of v16. I can use the provided initial states to get their current positions. Also I am provided the bconf for the base configuration (`v3`) is fixed, so I'll be using the existing objects and configurations. The poses will be placed with the same *z-value*.

           6.  Place `v14` at the designated pose
           
           These *place* actions meet the goal. The cost is the number of steps. That's 6. And that's that.
           

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Impassable Barrier: A Limitation in Action**
           
           Okay, so I see the problem crystal clear. The user flagged that the proposed plan was violating the constraints, and they were absolutely right. We're only given one action to work with: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  It's a curious action, essentially a no-op that just fiddles with the robot's base configuration *without* actually accomplishing any useful transformation.
           
           Our objective is a classic "arrange-the-blocks" scenario: getting `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all onto `v16`.  This calls for a solid grasp of *pick* and *place* actions.  We need to select an object, move it, and then set it down. But the permitted action... it just doesn't offer any of that! It's simply *not* equipped to handle object manipulation.
           
           Given our action set, it's immediately apparent that reaching the goal is impossible. We're essentially trying to build a castle with just a single brick that doesn't move. Without the ability to actually *move* objects around, we're completely stuck. The problem is fundamentally unsolvable with the provided tools. We can't progress.
