(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for a Nearly-Square Object on a Square Surface**
           
           My goal is to generate 50 stable placements for a slightly rectangular object (ID 6) with dimensions approximately 0.073758 x 0.073758 on a square surface (0) spanning from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. A stable placement means the object is fully contained within the surface bounds.  A placement is defined by the surface index, rotation angle (theta in radians), and the object's center coordinates (x, y).
           
           Since the object's width and height are so close, it behaves almost like a perfect square.  Therefore, I'll calculate `effective_w` and `effective_h`, the object's dimensions *as rotated*, using standard bounding box calculations:
           
           `effective_w = obj_w * abs(cos(theta)) + obj_h * abs(sin(theta))`
           `effective_h = obj_w * abs(sin(theta)) + obj_h * abs(cos(theta))`
           
           Given that I have a nearly square object, I'm defining a simple way to get 50 different positions. First, I compute the *max* allowable absolute coordinate for the x and y axes for a given rotation. I calculate a few values for rotation, but I vary the rotation angle `theta` from 0 to pi in increments of pi/9. Then, for each rotation angle, I have 5 (x, y) coordinates:  the center of the surface, as well as the 4 corner points (min/max x and y coordinates). These ensure the placement remains within the surface boundaries.

(Thoughts: **Analysis and Placement Strategy for Object 5**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of the object placement task. I need to figure out where to put a new square object (Object 5) on Surface 0, while avoiding a fixed obstacle (Object 6). Object 6 is already successfully placed at the center of the surface with zero rotation.
           
           *   **Surface Constraints:** Surface 0 is a square measuring 0.27 x 0.27, extending from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           *   **Obstacle:** Object 6, also a square, is at (0, 0), and its size is 0.073758 x 0.073758. Because it's a square with zero rotation, its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) is the same as its dimensions. This means it occupies a central region.
           
           **Object 5 Properties:** Object 5 is also a square. Its size is 0.0974728 x 0.0974728. Given that, and the surface area, and object size, there will be very little real estate to place object 5. Because its a square, the effective dimensions won't change with rotation.
           
           **The Strategy:**
           
           1.  **Bounds Check:** I have to make sure the entire AABB of Object 5, even when rotated, stays within the bounds of Surface 0.
           2.  **Collision Avoidance:** The AABB of Object 5 *must not* overlap with the AABB of Object 6.
           
           **Calculations and Constraints:**
           
           *   Since Object 5 is a square, its bounding box size is fixed. Regardless of the rotation, its bounding box will be as is, so `effective_w` and `effective_h` equal `0.0974728`.
           *   The placement area is limited by Surface 0. Object 5 can range between +/- 0.086264 on both the x and y axes.
           *   Object 6 occupies a region centered at (0,0) of range [-0.03688, 0.03688] on both axes. This limits available placement.
           *   To avoid a collision the distance between the center of Object 5 and the center of Object 6 must be no less than 0.0856156. This calculation allows enough buffer space to prevent overlap.
           *   Object 5 cannot be placed anywhere within Object 6 plus the buffer space, and this region is quite small.
           *   Object 5 must be in the narrow region on the edges of the surface.
               *   `x` must be in `[-0.08626357, -0.0856156]` OR `[0.0856156, 0.08626357]`
               *   `y` must be in `[-0.08626357, -0.0856156]` OR `[0.0856156, 0.08626357]`
           
           This allows Object 5 to fit *only* on the corners.
           
           If I tried to rotate, the dimension would be larger than the non-rotated orientation. This will limit the available space further.
           
           Since rotation complicates things, I'll stick to a strategy that makes placement possible. Because it's a tight squeeze, I'll restrict my search space to the very thin strips along the edges of Surface 0. Here's the plan for 50 placements:
           
           1.  Keep Object 5 in the original orientation (`theta = 0`).
           2.  Calculate the precise `x` locations for the centers of the strips.
               *   `x_center_neg_strip_val = -0.08593959`
               *   `x_center_pos_strip_val = 0.08593959`
           3.  Generate 25 `y` coordinates spaced evenly from `Y_surf_min` to `Y_surf_max`.
           4.  Place 2 points on each y coordinate. One on the `x_neg` and another on the `x_pos`.
           
           Using this strategy guarantees there will not be a collision.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm dealing with. I need to place Object ID 4 on Surface 0, specifically 50 stable instances, while completely avoiding collisions with the two obstacles already present, Objects ID 6 and ID 5. This is a packing problem with the added complexity of obstacle avoidance. The surface itself is a rectangle, and both the new object and the existing ones are essentially square shaped. The scene data provides me with the precise dimensions and placement of the obstacles and the new object.
           
           **Constraints and Pre-Processing**
           
           My first thought is to understand the spatial constraints. I need to figure out the valid "free space" on Surface 0, where Object 4 can be placed without overlapping with either of the other two objects. This involves:
           
           1.  **Surface Limits:** I determine the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates for the center of Object 4, which is simply a matter of knowing the surface dimensions and the object's half-width/half-height.
           2.  **Obstacle Zones:** I calculate the forbidden regions around Objects 6 and 5. This will be where I *cannot* place the center of Object 4, as it would lead to a collision. Using the AABB method to simplify the calculations, I expand the bounding boxes of the obstacles by the half-width/height of Object 4. Any point within this enlarged box would result in a collision.
           3.  **Rotation Optimization:** I realize that since the object is a square and the available space is so tight, rotating it might not create more valid space. At any other angle, the object would be larger than with `theta=0`. So my initial assumption is to assume `theta=0`.
           
           **Detailed Spatial Analysis and Calculation**
           
           Now for the heavy lifting. I need to accurately map the free space. First, the surface bounds are easy: `[-0.090113, 0.090113] x [-0.090113, 0.090113]` after accounting for the object's size and keeping the object on the surface.
           
           Then I get into the obstacle avoidance part. Object 6 is centered at (0,0). So, to avoid object 6 I must exclude the center of object 4 within `(-0.0817658, 0.0817658) x (-0.0817658, 0.0817658)`. That's a square region around (0,0). Object 5 has a more complex positioning, so its area is the most important constraint.
           
           The critical issue is the placement of Object 5, as it constrains the valid placement area for Object 4 much more significantly. After calculations, I confirmed the safe placement region for Object 4's center. It boils down to finding where object 4's center *can* be, after subtracting the collision areas from both objects. The safe space is a tiny region in the top-right corner, defined by `x in [0.08176584379391326, 0.090113351941]` and `y in [0.08176584379391326, 0.090113351941]`.
           
           **Problem Resolution Strategy**
           
           Given that I need to provide 50 distinct stable positions for Object ID 4 and the only valid space for placing the object is so small, I now re-evaluate and look for a creative solution. I will treat these small intervals with high precision and provide a grid of points within this region. These will be distinct as long as I do them properly.
           
           The x-dimension of the bounding box is `0.090113 - 0.0817658 = 0.0083472` and y dimension. Since I have to get 50, I have no choice but to use small steps. I use the range to create 7 different x positions and 8 different y positions, creating `7 * 8 = 56` placements. Then I will cut to 50, which are distinct enough given the scale. This will give me `(0,0,x,y)` locations.
