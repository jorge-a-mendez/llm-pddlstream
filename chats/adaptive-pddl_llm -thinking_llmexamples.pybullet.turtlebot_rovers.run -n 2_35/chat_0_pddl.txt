           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Plan's Feasibility**
           
           My initial analysis focused on identifying the necessary steps to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, breaking it down into its constituent parts: acquiring images (`receivedimage`) and analyzing samples (`receivedanalysis`). I quickly realized that the problem hinges on the `atconf` predicate and the allowed actions.
           
           The initial state defines the rovers' configurations as `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`. However, the required actions—`take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`—all necessitate the rovers to be in different configurations (`#o3`, `#o0`, `#o5`).
           
           The only permitted actions are `move` (which effectively does nothing here since source and destination config are the same), and `drop_rock` (which is also not applicable). Because none of the permitted actions allow for the configuration change necessary to satisfy the `atconf` constraints of the required actions, and the required actions themselves are not allowed to be taken as they are not listed, it is clear that the goal is unattainable. Therefore, given the constraints of the problem—the limited allowed actions and the initial state—I conclude that the plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()` is *unfeasible*.
