           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v4 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.943, 0.154), (2.04, 0.25)).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unachievable Goal: A Plan Is Not Possible**
           
           Okay, here's the situation as I see it. My task is to create a plan to achieve the axiom `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom requires several conditions to be met, including receiving two images (`receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`) and receiving analysis of two types of samples (`receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`).  
           
           The initial state already satisfies some conditions. The real challenge lies in the images and analysis. To get an image, I need the rover to "take_image" and then "send_image" to the lander. The same concept is true for analyzing and sending a rock's analysis.
           
           However, here's the rub: both taking and sending require the rover to be at a specific configuration. The initial setup shows the rovers `v12` and `v14` are fixed at configurations `v13` and `v15` respectively, and the allowed actions only contain `move` actions which do nothing.
           
           To take an image, I need to be *where* the image is visible. The initial state says these images are visible from configuration `#o3`.  To analyze, I need to be where the rock is located `#o5`. But the rover *cannot* move to `#o3` or `#o5`. The only allowed `move` actions are identity actions—the rovers stay put.
           
           Similarly, I need to *send* the image or the analysis to the lander. The lander is visible from configuration `#o0`.  But the rover cannot get to `#o0` either. The rover can only "see" configurations that are "given" in the problem, and since it *cannot move* the `atconf(?v, ?q)` predicate will never match the required `?q` for actions involving images and analysis.
           
           Therefore, because the rovers are locked into their starting configurations, I cannot satisfy the preconditions for the actions needed to achieve `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`. This means I can't meet the primary requirements for this axiom. The plan is, in essence, impossible to execute given the constraints.
