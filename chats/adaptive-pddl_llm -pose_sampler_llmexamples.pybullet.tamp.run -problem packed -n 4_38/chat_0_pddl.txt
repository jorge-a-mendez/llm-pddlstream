           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27. The object is a square with dimensions 0.08086509960534238 x 0.08086509960534238. Since the object is square, its orientation (theta) does not affect its footprint. I will try to place the object in various positions on the surface, making sure it stays within the surface boundaries. The available surface is large enough to accommodate the object.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27. There is already an object (ID 4) placed at (0, 0, 0) which is a square with side length 0.080865. The new object (ID 6) is also a square, with side length 0.08954. I need to find stable placements for object 6, ensuring it is within the surface bounds and does not collide with object 4. Since both objects are squares, their orientation does not affect their bounding box for collision checking.
           
           Object 4 occupies the area from roughly -0.04 to 0.04 in both x and y.
           The new object 6 has a side of 0.08954, so its half-side is 0.04477.
           
           To avoid collision with object 4, the new object's center must be at least (0.04 + 0.04477) = 0.08477 away from the center of object 4 in either x or y, if placed axis-aligned.
           
           Surface limits: -0.135 to 0.135.
           Object 6 half-size: 0.04477.
           Possible center range for object 6: -0.135 + 0.04477 to 0.135 - 0.04477, which is approximately -0.09 to 0.09.
           
           I will try to place object 6 along the edges of the surface, away from the center where object 4 is.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27.
           There are two previously placed objects:
           - Object 4 (ID: 4) is at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) with size 0.080865 x 0.080865. Its bounding box is approximately from (-0.0404, -0.0404) to (0.0404, 0.0404).
           - Object 6 (ID: 6) is at (0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.0) with size 0.089546 x 0.089546. Its bounding box is approximately from (0.09 - 0.04477, -0.04477) to (0.09 + 0.04477, 0.04477), which is (0.04523, -0.04477) to (0.13477, 0.04477).
           
           The new object (ID: 5) is a square with size 0.098519 x 0.098519. Its half-size is approximately 0.04926.
           The surface bounds are from -0.135 to 0.135.
           For object 5 to be stable, its center must be between -0.135 + 0.04926 and 0.135 - 0.04926, which is approximately -0.08574 to 0.08574 in both x and y.
           
           Collision avoidance:
           - With Object 4 (center (0,0), half-size 0.0404): Object 5's center must be at least (0.0404 + 0.04926) = 0.08966 away from (0,0) in x or y.
           - With Object 6 (center (0.09,0), half-size 0.04477): Object 5's center must be at least (0.04477 + 0.04926) = 0.09403 away from (0.09,0) in x or y.
           
           This means object 5 cannot be too close to (0,0) or (0.09,0). Given the constraints, the remaining space for object 5 is limited. I will try to place it on the left side of the surface.
           
           Let's try to place it on the far left. The maximum x-coordinate for the center of object 5, considering the surface, is 0.135 - 0.04926 = 0.08574. The minimum is -0.08574.
           
           The bounding box of object 4 is roughly x: [-0.04, 0.04], y: [-0.04, 0.04].
           The bounding box of object 6 is roughly x: [0.045, 0.135], y: [-0.045, 0.045].
           
           Let's try to place object 5 on the left, for example, center x around -0.08.
           Its bounding box would be roughly x: [-0.08 - 0.049, -0.08 + 0.049] = [-0.129, -0.031].
           This range does not overlap with object 4's x-range ([-0.04, 0.04]) and not with object 6's x-range ([0.045, 0.135]). So, placing it at x=-0.08 should work.
           For y, I can try 0.0, as the existing objects are centered on y=0 or near it, but their combined y-range is narrow.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27.
           There are three previously placed objects:
           - Object 4 (ID: 4) is at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) with size 0.080865 x 0.080865. Its half-size is ~0.0404. Its bounding box is approximately from (-0.0404, -0.0404) to (0.0404, 0.0404).
           - Object 6 (ID: 6) is at (0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.0) with size 0.089546 x 0.089546. Its half-size is ~0.0448. Its bounding box is approximately from (0.09 - 0.0448, -0.0448) to (0.09 + 0.0448, 0.0448), which is (0.0442, -0.0448) to (0.1348, 0.0448).
           - Object 5 (ID: 5) is at (0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.0) with size 0.098519 x 0.098519. Its half-size is ~0.0493. Its bounding box is approximately from (-0.08 - 0.0493, -0.0493) to (-0.08 + 0.0493, 0.0493), which is (-0.1293, -0.0493) to (-0.0307, 0.0493).
           
           The new object (ID: 7) is a square with size 0.09779 x 0.09779. Its half-size is approximately 0.0489.
           The surface bounds are from -0.135 to 0.135.
           For object 7 to be stable, its center must be between -0.135 + 0.0489 and 0.135 - 0.0489, which is approximately -0.0861 to 0.0861 in both x and y.
           
           Collision avoidance:
           The three existing objects effectively occupy a strip along the x-axis, centered on y=0.
           - Object 5: x-range [-0.1293, -0.0307]
           - Object 4: x-range [-0.0404, 0.0404]
           - Object 6: x-range [0.0442, 0.1348]
           
           It's clear there's overlap in the x-ranges of object 4 and 5. This is based on the success messages from the system. This implies that the 'successful' placements are not necessarily collision-free with *other* placed objects, but rather with *fixed obstacles*. My initial assumption about collision checking between previously placed objects and the current object must be re-evaluated. The problem statement says "if you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j." This means *I* must ensure no collision.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the free space.
           Object 4: x: [-0.0404, 0.0404], y: [-0.0404, 0.0404]
           Object 6: x: [0.0452, 0.1348], y: [-0.0448, 0.0448] (center 0.09, 0)
           Object 5: x: [-0.1293, -0.0307], y: [-0.0493, 0.0493] (center -0.08, 0)
           
           From this, the union of existing objects (rough estimate):
           x-occupied: [-0.1293, 0.1348] (almost entire surface width)
           y-occupied: [-0.0493, 0.0493]
           
           The remaining space for object 7 (half-size ~0.0489) must be outside this y-range.
           The surface y-range is [-0.135, 0.135].
           The unoccupied y-regions are:
           1. [-0.135, -0.0493 - 0.0489] = [-0.135, -0.0982]
           2. [0.0493 + 0.0489, 0.135] = [0.0982, 0.135]
           
           This gives us two narrow strips at the top and bottom of the surface.
           Let's try to place object 7 in the upper strip. The y-center must be at least 0.0982 + 0.0489 = 0.0982.
           Actually, for the center: y_center_min = 0.0493 + 0.0489 = 0.0982. But the object half-size is 0.0489, so the lowest edge would be 0.0982 - 0.0489 = 0.0493, which is just outside the other objects. The y-center must be within the surface: 0.135 - 0.0489 = 0.0861. This means the highest y_center can be. So, to fit completely, y_center must be between 0.0982 and 0.0861, which is contradictory.
           
           My calculation of required separation for center-to-center is correct (sum of half-sizes).
           So, if an object's bounding box is [x1, x2] and another's is [x3, x4], they don't collide if x2 < x3 or x4 < x1.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the y-limits for Object 7 (half-size 0.0489):
           The lowest y-position for object 7's top edge to be at least 0.0493 (top of object 5's bounding box) is:
           y_center + 0.0489 >= 0.0493 => y_center >= 0.0004. This is too close.
           
           Let's clarify collision:
           Object A (center Ax, Ay, half_width Aw, half_height Ah)
           Object B (center Bx, By, half_width Bw, half_height Bh)
           Collision if:
           abs(Ax - Bx) < Aw + Bw AND abs(Ay - By) < Ah + Bh
           
           Let's try to place object 7 entirely above or below the combined y-span of (object 4, 5, 6).
           The maximum y extent of existing objects is 0.0493 (from object 5's top edge).
           The minimum y extent of existing objects is -0.0493 (from object 5's bottom edge).
           
           To place object 7 above this, its bottom edge must be above 0.0493.
           So, y_center_7 - 0.0489 > 0.0493 => y_center_7 > 0.0982.
           The maximum y_center_7, to stay on the surface, is 0.135 - 0.0489 = 0.0861.
           This means there is no room to place object 7 entirely *above* the current configuration if its full width is used.
           
           Similarly for placing below:
           y_center_7 + 0.0489 < -0.0493 => y_center_7 < -0.0982.
           The minimum y_center_7, to stay on the surface, is -0.135 + 0.0489 = -0.0861.
           Again, this is contradictory.
           
           This implies that if object 7 is placed axis-aligned, it *must* collide with the y-span of the existing objects.
           The only way to avoid collision is to place it such that its x-span does not overlap with *any* of the existing objects. But the x-span of the existing objects is already from -0.1293 to 0.1348. This covers almost the entire surface.
           Surface x-range: [-0.135, 0.135]. Object 7 half-size x: 0.0489.
           Allowed x-center for object 7: [-0.0861, 0.0861].
           
           Let's review the collision definition with the actual placement:
           Obj 4: center (0,0), half-size 0.04043
           Obj 6: center (0.09,0), half-size 0.04477
           Obj 5: center (-0.08,0), half-size 0.04926
           
           Consider the gaps in X:
           Gap between 5 and 4:
           Right edge of 5: -0.08 + 0.04926 = -0.03074
           Left edge of 4: 0 - 0.04043 = -0.04043
           This gap is negative, meaning they overlap!
           The overlap is from -0.04043 to -0.03074.
           
           Gap between 4 and 6:
           Right edge of 4: 0 + 0.04043 = 0.04043
           Left edge of 6: 0.09 - 0.04477 = 0.04523
           This is a positive gap: [0.04043, 0.04523]. The gap size is 0.0048.
           The width of object 7 is 0.09779. It cannot fit in this small gap.
           
           So, it seems that the successful placements from the previous turn *do* collide with each other. This contradicts the instruction "you must avoid collision between objects i and j".
           This implies the system is using a different definition of collision, or my understanding of the problem statement is incorrect, or the provided 'successes' are simply valid in isolation, not considering other objects.
           Given the instruction "you must avoid collision between objects i and j", I have to assume the bounding boxes of previously placed objects are effectively "fixed obstacles" that the new object must not collide with.
           
           If the previous placements *do* collide, then my understanding of "avoid collision between objects i and j" must be wrong. If I *must* avoid collision, and the previous successes collide, then the premise is flawed, or I must be more conservative.
           
           Let's assume the success feedback *overrides* my geometric calculations and that objects 4, 5, and 6 are successfully placed and are *not* colliding in the environment's internal representation. This means my AABB collision check is either too strict or not the exact method used by the system.
           
           If I cannot rely on standard AABB collision, then I need to find new strategies.
           Perhaps the collision checking is not axis-aligned for previous objects if they were rotated? No, all previous `theta` values were 0.0.
           
           Let's try to place object 7 in a region that *would* be collision-free based on the given object sizes and positions, even if the system reports previous placements as successes.
           The combined X-span of existing objects is [-0.1293, 0.1348]. This is almost the entire surface.
           The combined Y-span of existing objects is [-0.0493, 0.0493].
           
           If there is truly no room for object 7 without collision, then the only option is to "try" placements and see what the system accepts. But the instruction is to "avoid collision".
           
           Could it be that the object's 'extents' are *maximum* dimensions, and the actual collision geometry is smaller or different? The problem states "geometry of the object will be described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)". This strongly implies I should use the given sizes for AABB collision.
           
           If the previous objects are considered "fixed obstacles" that I must avoid, then the space is indeed very constrained.
           The only way to avoid the existing objects (given my AABB collision model) is to place object 7 in the narrow strips above or below, if possible.
           Let's recheck the maximum y-center for the upper strip: 0.135 (surface upper bound) - 0.0489 (obj7 half-size) = 0.0861.
           Let's recheck the minimum y-center for object 7 to clear object 5 (max y-span 0.0493): 0.0493 (obj5 max y) + 0.0489 (obj7 half-size) = 0.0982.
           Since 0.0982 > 0.0861, there is no y-position where object 7 can be placed *entirely above* the existing objects without its bounding box exceeding the surface.
           The same logic applies to placing it below.
           
           This means that an axis-aligned placement of object 7 without collision with any of 4, 5, or 6 is impossible if I use the provided AABB dimensions and my understanding of AABB collision.
           This implies either:
           1. The objects have internal margins, or their effective AABB for collision is smaller than specified.
           2. The problem implies I should ignore previously placed objects for collision checking, and only check against the surface and "fixed obstacles" (if any, which are not explicitly given here except implicitly by 'failures'). But the explicit "avoid collision between objects i and j" contradicts this.
           3. The definition of "stable" allows for partial overlap. This is unlikely for collision.
           4. The system is designed such that I must make *some* collision unavoidable, and it will only tell me if *I* made a mistake in placing.
           
           Given "you must avoid collision between objects i and j", I *must* try to avoid collisions. The only explanation for the reported 'successes' with overlaps is that the actual collision geometry is smaller than the full AABB extent, or there's a different collision model. Since I'm not told about a different model, I have to stick to AABB based on extents.
           
           My only option if I strictly follow the "avoid collision" rule based on AABB is to declare no solution. But I "never give up".
           
           Therefore, I will try to place it in the areas that *minimally* overlap with previously placed objects, or areas that seem "open" based on visual intuition.
           The gaps along the x-axis are almost non-existent.
           Let's try to place it in one of the corners of the surface, away from the current "cluster" of objects, but knowing this might still result in collision based on Y-overlap.
           Let's put it on the far top-left, for example.
           The center for obj 7 (half-size 0.0489)
           x: -0.135 + 0.0489 = -0.0861
           y: 0.135 - 0.0489 = 0.0861
           
           This placement's bounding box would be:
           x: [-0.135, -0.0372]
           y: [0.0861 - 0.0489, 0.0861 + 0.0489] = [0.0372, 0.135]
           
           This x-range overlaps with object 5's x-range [-0.1293, -0.0307].
           This y-range (0.0372, 0.135) also overlaps with object 5's y-range [-0.0493, 0.0493].
           Specifically, [0.0372, 0.0493] is an overlapping y-interval.
           
           I will proceed by trying placements that maximize distance from existing objects, as this is the best I can do under strict interpretation. I will try the top-left and bottom-left, top-right and bottom-right corners.
