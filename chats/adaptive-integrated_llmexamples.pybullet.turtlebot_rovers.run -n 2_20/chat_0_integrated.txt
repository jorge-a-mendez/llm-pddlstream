           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem requires us to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` which is a conjunction of several conditions. Let's analyze the `new-axiom@0()` definition:
           
           `Axiom new-axiom@0()`
             `Conjunction`
               `Atom atconf(v12, v13)`
               `Atom atconf(v14, v15)`
               `Atom free(v12, v16)`
               `Atom free(v14, v16)`
               `Atom receivedimage(v17, v11)`
               `Atom receivedimage(v18, v11)`
               `Atom type(?stone, v2)`
               `Atom receivedanalysis(?stone)`
               `Atom type(?soil, v6)`
               `Atom receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           From the initial state:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` is true.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)` is true.
           - `free(v12, v16)` is true.
           - `free(v14, v16)` is true.
           
           This means we need to achieve:
           1. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           2. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           3. `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for any object of type `v2` (stone).
           4. `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for any object of type `v6` (soil).
           
           Let's look at the available actions that can achieve these subgoals.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(?o, ?m)`:
           The `send_image` action is required: `(send_image ?v ?q ?y ?l ?o ?m)`.
           Preconditions for `send_image`:
           - `comvisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l)`
           - `objective(?o)`
           - `mode(?m)`
           - `haveimage(?v, ?o, ?m)`
           - `atconf(?v, ?q)`
           - `~blocked(?y)`
           
           To achieve `haveimage(?v, ?o, ?m)`:
           The `take_image` action is required: `(take_image ?v ?q ?y ?o ?c ?m)`.
           Preconditions for `take_image`:
           - `imagevisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o)`
           - `onboard(?c, ?v)`
           - `supports(?c, ?m)`
           - `atconf(?v, ?q)`
           - `calibrated(?c, ?v)`
           - `~blocked(?y)`
           
           To achieve `calibrated(?c, ?v)`:
           The `calibrate` action is required: `(calibrate ?v ?q ?y ?o ?c)`.
           Preconditions for `calibrate`:
           - `imagevisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o)`
           - `onboard(?c, ?v)`
           - `atconf(?v, ?q)`
           - `~blocked(?y)`
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?r)`:
           The `send_analysis` action is required: `(send_analysis ?v ?q ?y ?l ?r)`.
           Preconditions for `send_analysis`:
           - `comvisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l)`
           - `rock(?r)`
           - `analyzed(?v, ?r)`
           - `atconf(?v, ?q)`
           - `~blocked(?y)`
           
           To achieve `analyzed(?v, ?r)`:
           The `sample_rock` action is required: `(sample_rock ?v ?q ?r ?s)`.
           Preconditions for `sample_rock`:
           - `above(?v, ?q, ?r)`
           - `store(?s)`
           - `atconf(?v, ?q)`
           - `free(?v, ?s)`
           
           Let's break down the goal into individual parts and see how we can achieve them with the given initial state and allowed actions.
           
           **Goal 1: `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`**
           
           - We need to take images of `v17` and `v18` with mode `v11` using camera `v10` on either `v12` or `v14`, then send them.
           - From initial state: `objective(v17)`, `objective(v18)`, `mode(v11)`, `camera(v10)`, `onboard(v10, v12)`, `onboard(v10, v14)`, `supports(v10, v11)`.
           - For rover `v12`:
               - `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`.
               - `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`.
               - `atconf(v12, v13)`
           - For rover `v14`:
               - `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`.
               - `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`.
               - `atconf(v14, v15)`
           
           We can use `v12` to take images of both `v17` and `v18` and send them to `v9`.
           - First, calibrate camera `v10` on `v12` at `#o3` (which is already `conf(v12, #o3)`) using `v17` (or `v18`) as target.
               - `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)`
           - Then, take image of `v17`.
               - `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)`
           - Recalibrate for `v18` as the camera becomes uncalibrated after taking an image.
               - `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10)`
           - Then, take image of `v18`.
               - `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11)`
           - Send images of `v17` and `v18`.
               - `(send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11)`
               - `(send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11)`
           
           **Goal 2: `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`**
           
           - We need to sample a rock of type `v2` (stone) and a rock of type `v6` (soil), then send their analyses.
           - From initial state, rocks of type `v2` (stone): `v1`, `v3`, `v4`. Rocks of type `v6` (soil): `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           - `store(v16)`, `free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)`.
           - `lander(v9)`.
           
           Let's choose `v12` to sample rocks.
           - `above(v12, #o5, v5)` (type `v6` soil).
           - `above(v12, #o5, v4)` (type `v2` stone).
           - `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`.
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`.
           - `conf(v12, #o5)`.
           
           - Sample a soil rock, e.g., `v5`.
               - `(sample_rock v12 #o5 v5 v16)`
           - Send analysis of `v5`.
               - `(send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v5)`
           - `free(v12, v16)` becomes false after `sample_rock`. We need to drop the rock to free the store for the next sample.
               - `(drop_rock v12 v16)`
           - Sample a stone rock, e.g., `v4`.
               - `(sample_rock v12 #o5 v4 v16)`
           - Send analysis of `v4`.
               - `(send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v4)`
           
           This plan seems to cover all aspects of the goal. The continuous parameters #o0, #o1, #o3, #o4, #o5 are already available in the initial state as part of the `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, `conf`, `ray`, and `above` predicates. We don't need to specify values for them unless they are part of a `conf(rover, #name)` predicate and are the second argument to an `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate. In this case, #o3 and #o0 are such configurations.
           
           Let's find the values for `#o0` and `#o3`.
           - `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`: The rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). `v18` is at ((0.622, 1.986), (0.711, 2.075)). A suitable configuration `#o3` for `v12` to view `v18` would be roughly between `v13` and `v18`, with line of sight. Given the AABB of v18, a good position for `v12` would be to move forward and slightly to the left.
           - `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`: The rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). `v9` is at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). A suitable configuration `#o0` for `v12` to communicate with `v9` would be somewhere where it has a clear line of sight, perhaps further to the left.
           
           Since `v12` is already at `v13` and there are no `move` actions that change `v12`'s configuration from `v13` to any other specific config (only `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` which is a no-op), we should assume that `#o3` and `#o0` are at `v13` or reachable from `v13` with the provided `motion` predicates.
           
           The initial state includes `conf(v12, #o5)`, `above(v12, #o5, v5)`, `above(v12, #o5, v4)` etc. This means #o5 is a valid configuration for `v12` to be above the rocks. Also `conf(v12, #o3)` implies #o3 is a valid config for image capture. Similarly, `conf(v12, #o0)` implies #o0 is a valid config for communication. Since no other specific movement actions are provided, we should assume the robot is already at these configurations or can achieve them instantly without explicit `move` actions, as long as `atconf(v12, v13)` holds and the `conf` predicates are true for the required configurations. The `atconf` must match for each action. The current `atconf` is `v13` for `v12`. Therefore, the configurations `#o3`, `#o0`, `#o5` must be equal to `v13` for the actions to be executable. Or, if the goal implicitly suggests that these configurations are reachable through some "no-op" moves like `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`, then we can use them. However, a more stringent interpretation is that the `atconf` must match exactly.
           
           Let's assume that `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5` can be reached from `v13` by `v12` and `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5` can be reached from `v15` by `v14` without explicit `move` actions, as long as the initial `atconf` matches for some configuration for which `conf` is true. The available `move` actions are no-ops. This implies that the specific configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are assumed to be equivalent to `v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14` for the given action instances, or that `atconf` predicates for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are implicitly true when at `v13` or `v15`. Given the lack of actual move actions, the simplest interpretation is that the rover is effectively at `v13` for all operations involving `v12` and `v15` for `v14` and these continuous configurations represent a viewing or sampling posture from that location.
           
           We need to provide specific continuous values for configurations starting with '#'.
           For `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`:
           Rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           Target `v18` AABB: ((0.622, 1.986), (0.711, 2.075)).
           We need to find a position for `v12` (represented by `#o3`) such that it's collision-free and has line of sight to `v18`. A good point could be slightly adjusted from `v13` to point towards `v18`. Let's pick an x, y. The ray `v13` to `v18` would be around (1.0, -1.75) to (0.66, 2.03). This is within range.
           
           For `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`:
           Rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           Target `v9` AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
           A position for `v12` (represented by `#o0`) for `comvisible` to `v9`. This requires line of sight. `v13` to `v9` would be around (1.0, -1.75) to (-1.8, -2.0).
           
           Since `conf(v12, #o5)` is in the initial state, and it's used for `above` predicate, we should assume `v12` is at `#o5` for sampling, but for `atconf` it is `v13`. Given the available actions, we cannot change `atconf` to `#o5`. This means that `#o5` must be equivalent to `v13`. Similarly, `#o3` and `#o0` must be `v13`.
           Let's make `#o3` and `#o0` equal to `v13` and assume these are valid configurations (or small adjustments from `v13` to look at objects, effectively from `v13`).
           However, the problem statement says "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration".
           This suggests that `#o3` and `#o0` need specific values, distinct from `v13`. Let's assume these values are relative poses with respect to the rover's base frame `v13`. We need to provide the absolute (x,y) coordinates.
           
           Let's provide the (x,y) for these configurations.
           For `#o3` (for `v12` viewing `v17` and `v18`): `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). `v17` is at ((-0.685, 2.148), (-0.595, 2.238)). `v18` is at ((0.622, 1.986), (0.711, 2.075)). A good general point for observing objectives would be slightly forward and centered, e.g., (0.9, 0.0). The distance from (1.0, -1.75) to (0.9, 0.0) is about 1.76. This is well within a range of 2.
           For `#o0` (for `v12` communicating with `v9`): `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). `v9` is at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). A good point for communication might be (0.0, -2.0). The distance from (1.0, -1.75) to (0.0, -2.0) is approx 1.03. This is well within a range of 4.
           
           The actions for `v14` are also present in the initial state. Since we only need one rover to achieve the goal and `v12` is sufficient, we will only use `v12`.
           
           Let's re-verify the plan structure:
           1. Calibrate camera on v12 for v17.
           2. Take image of v17.
           3. Send image of v17.
           4. Calibrate camera on v12 for v18.
           5. Take image of v18.
           6. Send image of v18.
           7. Sample rock v5 (soil).
           8. Send analysis of v5.
           9. Drop rock from v12 (to free store).
           10. Sample rock v4 (stone).
           11. Send analysis of v4.
           
           This sequence covers all parts of the `new-axiom@0()` goal. All `atconf` for `v12` actions will be `v13`. And configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` will be specified.
           
           Final check on available actions: only `move` and `drop_rock` are in the list of valid action instances provided at the end. This is a critical constraint.
           If only these specific actions are available, then it's impossible to achieve the goal because `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis` are *not* in the allowed list.
           
           If the "list of valid action instances" refers to the actions which can be used, and not just the continuous values, then the problem is unsolvable. I must assume that the list of *types* of actions given (`move`, `take_image`, etc.) are the allowed actions, and the "list of valid action instances" provided at the end refers to specific, pre-computed *instances* of actions that have pre-computed continuous parameters, but we can also use other instances of these actions (e.g. `take_image`) by computing their continuous parameters. If only the *exact* instances listed are allowed, then the goal is unreachable.
           Given the prompt: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." This means that only the two `move` actions and two `drop_rock` actions can be used.
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable as it requires imaging and sampling actions that are not available.
           
           If I made a mistake in interpreting "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan", and that list is *only* about pre-computed continuous parameters, but the general action schema can be used, then the plan above would be valid.
           However, I must follow the prompt. The prompt states: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." And the list only contains:
           `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))`
           `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`
           `((drop_rock v12 v16))`
           `((drop_rock v14 v16))`
           
           None of the actions required to take images, send images, sample rocks, or send analyses are in this list. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
           
           The `new-axiom@0()` goal requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates to be true. These are effects of `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, respectively. `send_image` requires `haveimage` (effect of `take_image`), and `send_analysis` requires `analyzed` (effect of `sample_rock`). Since none of `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` are in the provided list of allowed action instances, it's impossible to achieve the goal.
           
           The only actions allowed are `move` (no-op moves in this case) and `drop_rock`. These actions cannot create `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` facts.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable given the constraints.
           The initial state also does not contain any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` facts.
           
           No plan can be generated.
