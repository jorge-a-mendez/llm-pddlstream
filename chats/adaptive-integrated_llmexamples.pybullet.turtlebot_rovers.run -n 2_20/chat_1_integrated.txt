           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires several conditions to be met, including:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This means we need to take images of `v17` and `v18` with mode `v11` and then send them to the lander `v9`.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This implies analyzing a rock of type `v2` and sending the analysis. `v1`, `v3`, `v4` are rocks of type `v2`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This implies analyzing a rock of type `v6` and sending the analysis. `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are rocks of type `v6`.
           
           Given the initial state, rover `v12` is at `v13` and rover `v14` is at `v15`. Both rovers have camera `v10` which supports mode `v11` and a free store `v16`.
           
           To satisfy `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           - Rover `v12` can observe `v17` and `v18` at configuration `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           - Rover `v14` can also observe `v17` and `v18` at configuration `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           - Both rovers can communicate with lander `v9` at configuration `#o0` with ray `#o1`.
           
           To satisfy `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for type `v2` (e.g., v1, v3, v4):
           - Rover `v12` is above rocks `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           - Rover `v14` is above rocks `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           
           To satisfy `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for type `v6` (e.g., v5, v7, v8):
           - Same as above, rovers can sample these rocks at configuration `#o5`.
           
           We can use rover `v12` to handle all image and analysis tasks.
           
           Plan:
           1. Calibrate `v10` for `v17` using `v12` at `#o3`.
           2. Take image of `v17` with `v12` at `#o3`.
           3. Calibrate `v10` for `v18` using `v12` at `#o3`.
           4. Take image of `v18` with `v12` at `#o3`.
           5. Move `v12` to `#o0` to send images.
           6. Send image of `v17`.
           7. Send image of `v18`.
           8. Move `v12` to `#o5` to sample rocks.
           9. Sample a rock of type `v2` (e.g., `v1`).
           10. Sample a rock of type `v6` (e.g., `v5`).
           11. Move `v12` back to `#o0` to send analyses.
           12. Send analysis of `v1`.
           13. Send analysis of `v5`.
           
           This plan utilizes existing configurations and satisfies all goals.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The previous plan had collision issues with the configurations `#o0` and `#o5` for `v12`. I need to find new collision-free configurations for these actions.
           Let's analyze the requirements for `#o0` (communication with `v9`) and `#o5` (sampling `v1` and `v5`).
           
           Object `v9` (lander) is at `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
           Object `v1` (rock) is at `((1.049, -0.656), (1.131, -0.575))`.
           Object `v5` (rock) is at `((-1.641, -0.676), (-1.5, -0.535))`.
           
           Collision obstacles:
           `v19`: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1)) - This is a thin vertical wall along x=0.
           `v20`: AABB(lower=(-0.195, 0.029), upper=(-0.093, 0.130)) - This is a small block in the upper-left quadrant.
           
           The previous `#o0` (0.0, 0.0) for `v12` to communicate with `v9` was colliding with `v19` and `v20`. `v9` is at x values between -2.4 and -1.39. This means that to communicate with `v9`, `v12` will likely need to be on the left side of `v19` (x < -0.05). Let's try `(-1.5, -1.0)` for communication with `v9`.
           
           The previous `#o5` (0.0, 0.0) for `v12` to sample `v1` and `v5` was colliding with `v19` and `v20`.
           `v1` is at x values between 1.049 and 1.131. So for `v1`, `v12` should be on the right side of `v19` (x > 0.05), e.g., `(1.0, -0.6)`.
           `v5` is at x values between -1.641 and -1.5. So for `v5`, `v12` should be on the left side of `v19` (x < -0.05), e.g., `(-1.6, -0.6)`.
           
           Since a single `#o5` configuration is used for multiple rocks, and the rocks are on different sides of `v19`, it's not possible to sample both `v1` and `v5` at the *same* `#o5` configuration if `v12` is to avoid `v19`. I will use `v14` to sample the rocks on the left side and `v12` for the rocks on the right side.
           Rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). This is on the right side of `v19`.
           Rover `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). This is on the left side of `v19`.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the plan with this in mind:
           
           Goals:
           1. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
              - `v12` can observe `v17` and `v18` at configuration `#o3` with ray `#o4`. Let's assume `#o3` is a valid config (0.916, 0.999), which is on the right side of `v19`, and far from `v20`.
              - `v12` also needs to communicate. Let's find a collision-free `#o0` for `v12` to communicate with `v9` (lander at x between -2.405 and -1.395). `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). Moving to communicate with `v9` means crossing `v19`.
              - Alternatively, `v14` can communicate with `v9`. `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). This is on the same side of `v19` as `v9`. Let's use `v14` for communication.
              - For `v14` to communicate with `v9`, a configuration like `(-1.5, -1.0)` for `#o0` should be fine. It's to the left of `v19` and not near `v20`.
           
           2. `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for type `v2` (e.g., v1, v3, v4):
              - `v1` is at `((1.049, -0.656), (1.131, -0.575))`. Rover `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75) is close to `v1`. A suitable `#o5` for `v12` could be `(1.1, -0.6)` for sampling `v1`.
           3. `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for type `v6` (e.g., v5, v7, v8):
              - `v5` is at `((-1.641, -0.676), (-1.5, -0.535))`. Rover `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) is close to `v5`. A suitable `#o5` for `v14` could be `(-1.6, -0.6)` for sampling `v5`.
           
           Revised Plan:
           - `v12` takes images of `v17` and `v18`.
           - `v12` samples rock `v1` (type `v2`).
           - `v14` samples rock `v5` (type `v6`).
           - `v14` sends images and analyses (since it's on the same side as `v9`).
           
           Let's try to get `v12` to do images and sample `v1` (type `v2`), and `v14` to sample `v5` (type `v6`) and send all the data.
           
           Steps:
           1. `v12` calibrates for `v17` at `#o3`.
           2. `v12` takes image of `v17` at `#o3`.
           3. `v12` calibrates for `v18` at `#o3`.
           4. `v12` takes image of `v18` at `#o3`.
           5. `v12` moves to `#o5_v1` to sample `v1`.
           6. `v12` samples `v1`.
           7. `v14` moves to `#o5_v5` to sample `v5`.
           8. `v14` samples `v5`.
           9. `v12` drops its rock to free up the store.
           10. `v14` drops its rock to free up the store.
              - Wait, both rovers have their own free stores. They don't need to drop rocks until they need to sample more. The goal simply requires analysis, not specific rocks to be in specific stores.
              - So `v12` can sample `v1` and `v14` can sample `v5`.
           11. `v12` needs to get its images and analyses to `v14` for transmission, or `v12` needs to go to `v9`. It's stated `onboard(v10, v12)` and `onboard(v10, v14)`, meaning both rovers have the camera. `haveimage` is associated with the rover that took it. To send an image, the `haveimage` predicate must be true for the sending rover. So, `v12` needs to send its own images.
              - This means `v12` needs a collision-free path to a configuration `#o0_v12` for communication with `v9`.
              - And `v14` needs a collision-free path to a configuration `#o0_v14` for communication with `v9`.
           
           Let's assume `v12` does all imaging and sampling for type `v2`.
           Let's assume `v14` does all sampling for type `v6` and all communications. This implies `v12` needs to transfer its images and analysis results to `v14`. However, there is no `transfer` action. So `v12` must do its own communication.
           
           Revised Plan (rover `v12` for images and `v1` analysis, rover `v14` for `v5` analysis, both communicate independently):
           1. `v12` calibrates for `v17` at `#o3`.
           2. `v12` takes image of `v17` at `#o3`.
           3. `v12` calibrates for `v18` at `#o3`.
           4. `v12` takes image of `v18` at `#o3`.
           5. `v12` moves to a config near `v1` (e.g., `#o5_v1`).
           6. `v12` samples `v1`.
           7. `v12` moves to a config to communicate with `v9` (e.g., `#o0_v12`).
           8. `v12` sends image of `v17`.
           9. `v12` sends image of `v18`.
           10. `v12` sends analysis of `v1`.
           11. `v14` moves to a config near `v5` (e.g., `#o5_v5`).
           12. `v14` samples `v5`.
           13. `v14` moves to a config to communicate with `v9` (e.g., `#o0_v14`).
           14. `v14` sends analysis of `v5`.
           
           Let's choose specific coordinates for the new configurations:
           - `#o3` for `v12` (image of `v17`, `v18`): `(0.916, 0.999)` from previous attempt. It's to the right of `v19` and far from `v20`. This seems fine. `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). This move is across a large distance, but within reach.
           - `#o5_v1` for `v12` (sampling `v1`): `v1` is at `(1.049, -0.656)` to `(1.131, -0.575)`. Let's pick `(1.1, -0.6)` for `#o5_v1`. `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). This is a reasonable move.
           - `#o0_v12` for `v12` (communicating with `v9`): `v9` is at `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`. `v12` needs to move from the right side of `v19` (x > 0.05) to the left side (x < -0.05). Let's pick `(-1.5, -1.0)`. This would mean passing through `v19`. This is not possible. Rover `v12` *cannot* communicate with `v9` if `v19` is in the way.
             - This is a critical problem. If `v12` cannot move through `v19`, and `v9` is on the left of `v19` while `v12` starts on the right, `v12` cannot communicate.
             - Let's re-examine `comvisible`: `comvisible(?v: object, ?q: object, ?y: object, ?l: object)`. Ray is between `?q` and `?l`. If `v12` stays at `v13` (1.0, -1.75), `v9` is at `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`. The ray between these would definitely intersect `v19`. So `v12` cannot communicate with `v9`.
           
           This means `v14` must handle all communication. But `v12` has images and analysis.
           This points to an issue with the initial `haveimage` and `analyzed` predicates. They are tied to the specific rover. There's no action to transfer these states between rovers.
           
           If `v12` has `haveimage` and `analyzed` for `v1`, and `v14` is the only one that can communicate with `v9`, then the plan is not achievable as `v12` cannot send its data.
           
           Let's check if the goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied only by `v14`.
           `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
             - `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` are true.
             - `v14` needs to move to `#o3` (which is `(0.916, 0.999)`). `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). This move would cross `v19`. This also seems problematic.
           
           Let's assume a "transfer" of images/analysis is implicit or not necessary, and the goal `receivedimage(o, m)` simply means *some* rover sent it, not that the rover that took it must send it. However, the action `send_image` explicitly requires `haveimage(?v, ?o, ?m)`. This links the image to the specific rover `?v`. Same for `send_analysis`.
           
           So, the current setup implies that `v12` (starting on the right of `v19`) can *never* communicate with `v9` (on the far left). And `v14` (starting on the left of `v19`) can *never* take images of `v17`/`v18` unless it crosses `v19` or finds a path around it, which isn't explicitly available with the given `motion` predicates.
           
           The only `motion` predicates available are:
           `motion(v14, v15, #o2, v15)` (stays at `v15`)
           `motion(v14, #o3, #o2, v15)` (from `#o3` to `v15`)
           `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o3)` (from `v15` to `#o3`)
           ... and similar for other configs, but they don't seem to include motions that would take `v14` from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `#o3` (0.916, 0.999) *without* colliding with `v19`. The current `motion` predicates just define reachability, not collision-free path. The collision checking is done on the *configuration* itself.
           
           Let's assume the provided `motion` predicates already imply collision-free paths.
           `conf(v12, v13)` where `v13` is (1.0, -1.75)
           `conf(v14, v15)` where `v15` is (-1.0, -1.75)
           
           `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`. Let's assume `#o3` for `v12` is fine.
           `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`. Let's assume `#o0` for `v12` is fine.
           `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`. Let's assume `#o0` for `v14` is fine.
           
           The original problem states: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration such that, given the geometry of the scene, the configuration is collision-free for the rover, reachable from the rover's current configuration, and has occlusion-free line-of-sight to the target object".
           
           The initial state *does* include `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`. This implies that `v12` *can* communicate with `v9` at `#o0`. So I need to find a valid `#o0` for `v12` that's collision-free and allows line-of-sight to `v9`.
           `v9` is at `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
           `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           Obstacle `v19` is at `x=0`. To have line of sight to `v9` from the right side of `v19`, `v12` would need to be very far south or north to avoid `v19`, which is not covered by any valid motion. If the ray from `v12` at `#o0` to `v9` is blocked by `v19`, then `#o0` is not valid.
           The problem statement also says: "Any object that starts with a '#' represents a *continuous parameter*... Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           The provided `comvisible` predicates for `#o0` state:
           `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           
           This means there *exist* collision-free configurations `#o0` for both `v12` and `v14` to communicate with `v9`. My assumption about `v12` being unable to communicate with `v9` might be wrong, if there is a path or a ray that avoids `v19`. I must find such a configuration.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the plan, assuming I can find valid configurations.
           
           Rover `v12` starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           Rover `v14` starts at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           
           Goal: `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(v1)` (type `v2`), `receivedanalysis(v5)` (type `v6`).
           
           All image tasks can be done by `v12`:
           1. Calibrate `v12` for `v17` at `#o3`.
           2. Take image `v12` of `v17` at `#o3`.
           3. Calibrate `v12` for `v18` at `#o3`.
           4. Take image `v12` of `v18` at `#o3`.
           The current suggested `#o3` for `v12` is `(0.916, 0.999)`. This is fine.
           
           All analysis tasks:
           - Sample `v1` (type `v2`) with `v12` at `#o5_v1`. `v1` is at `((1.049, -0.656), (1.131, -0.575))`. Let `v12` move to `(1.1, -0.6)` for `#o5_v1`. This is fine.
           - Sample `v5` (type `v6`) with `v14` at `#o5_v5`. `v5` is at `((-1.641, -0.676), (-1.5, -0.535))`. Let `v14` move to `(-1.6, -0.6)` for `#o5_v5`. This is fine.
           
           Communication tasks:
           - `v12` must send `v17`, `v18` images and `v1` analysis. It needs to move to `#o0_v12` and communicate with `v9`.
             - `v9` is around `(-1.9, -2.0)`. `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). Obstacle `v19` is along `x=0`. To avoid `v19`, `v12` needs to find a position. A position like `(0.0, -2.0)` would be blocked by `v19`. A position like `(-1.0, -2.0)` would be on the correct side of `v19` to communicate with `v9`. Can `v12` get from `v13` to `(-1.0, -2.0)`? This would require crossing the x=0 line. If this is not allowed by `motion` or if collision checking on intermediate path is done, this is problematic.
             - Given the problem constraints, the configuration *itself* must be collision-free and allow line-of-sight. The `motion` predicates ensure reachability.
             - Let's try to find a `#o0_v12` for `v12` to communicate with `v9`. What if `v12` goes to `(-1.5, -1.0)`? This is on the left side of `v19`.
             - The crucial part is that `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o0)` must be one of the *valid action instances*. And it is! So `v12` *can* reach some `#o0` from `v13`.
             - Given that `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` is in the initial state, such a collision-free `#o0` with line-of-sight *must* exist. Let's try `(-1.5, -1.0)` for `#o0_v12`. `v9` is centered around `(-1.9, -2.0)`. A point `(-1.5, -1.0)` is close enough (distance < 4) and has line-of-sight to `v9` (no obstacle between them, given `(-1.5, -1.0)` is to the left of `v19` and not near `v20`).
           - `v14` must send `v5` analysis. It needs to move to `#o0_v14` and communicate with `v9`.
             - `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). `v9` is around `(-1.9, -2.0)`. `(-1.5, -1.0)` is a good candidate for `#o0_v14`. This is also close enough and has line-of-sight.
           
           Let's use the configuration `#o0` for both `v12` and `v14` to communicate with `v9`. Let's use `(-1.5, -1.0)` for `#o0`.
           Let's use the configuration `#o5` for `v12` to sample `v1`. Let's use `(1.1, -0.6)` for `#o5_v1`.
           Let's use the configuration `#o5_v14` for `v14` to sample `v5`. Let's use `(-1.6, -0.6)` for `#o5_v5`.
           The given list of actions only has `#o5` so I must use that. The problem states `above(v12, #o5, v5)`, `above(v12, #o5, v4)`, etc. and `above(v14, #o5, v5)`, etc. This suggests that the same `#o5` can be used by both rovers to sample any of the listed rocks. This is only possible if `#o5` itself is not tied to a specific rover's location. However, since the action `sample_rock` takes `?q` which is the rover's configuration, it seems `#o5` must be an actual location the rover can go to. If the same `#o5` value is used for both `v12` and `v14`, and these values are on opposite sides of `v19`, then it's impossible.
           The prompt says: "If your plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name." This implies that even if the *name* of the parameter is the same (e.g., `#o5`), the actual *value* can be different for different rovers or different targets.
           
           So, I will define different values for `#o0` and `#o5` based on which rover is using it and for what purpose.
           - `#o3_v12_v17_v18`: For `v12` taking images of `v17` and `v18`. Let's keep `(0.916, 0.999)`.
           - `#o5_v12_v1`: For `v12` sampling `v1`. Let's set it to `(1.1, -0.6)`.
           - `#o0_v12_v9`: For `v12` sending data to `v9`. Let's use `(-1.5, -1.0)`.
           - `#o5_v14_v5`: For `v14` sampling `v5`. Let's set it to `(-1.6, -0.6)`.
           - `#o0_v14_v9`: For `v14` sending data to `v9`. Let's use `(-1.5, -1.0)`.
           
           Crucially, the provided action instances for `move` are general (e.g., `(move v12 v13 #o2 #o0)`), meaning they can reach *any* valid configuration for `#o0`. The key is to define these valid configurations.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The previous plan's configurations were not reachable for the robot bases. This means the `move` actions to these configurations are problematic, even if the configurations themselves are collision-free and occlusion-free. The `motion` predicates in the initial state define reachability. Let's look at the available `motion` predicates again:
           
           For `v12` (currently at `v13` (1.0, -1.75)):
           - `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o0)`: Reachable from `v13` to `#o0`.
           - `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)`: Reachable from `v13` to `#o3`.
           - `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o5)`: Reachable from `v13` to `#o5`.
           - `motion(v12, v13, #o2, v13)`: Stays at `v13`.
           
           For `v14` (currently at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)):
           - `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o0)`: Reachable from `v15` to `#o0`.
           - `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o3)`: Reachable from `v15` to `#o3`.
           - `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o5)`: Reachable from `v15` to `#o5`.
           - `motion(v14, v15, #o2, v15)`: Stays at `v15`.
           
           The error message specifically says "not reachable for robot base," which contradicts the presence of these `motion` predicates if `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` refer to the specific continuous values I provided. It implies that I need to find new continuous values that are, in fact, reachable. The `motion` predicates tell us that a transition *can* occur, but not what coordinates the continuous parameters `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` should take.
           
           Let's re-strategize with the reachability constraint in mind. The initial positions of the rovers are `v13` (1.0, -1.75) for `v12` and `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) for `v14`.
           
           Objects:
           `v17` (objective): `(-0.685, 2.148)` to `(-0.595, 2.238)`
           `v18` (objective): `(0.622, 1.986)` to `(0.711, 2.075)`
           `v1` (rock, type v2): `(1.049, -0.656)` to `(1.131, -0.575)`
           `v5` (rock, type v6): `((-1.641, -0.676), (-1.5, -0.535))`
           `v9` (lander): `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`
           `v19` (obstacle): `x=0` wall
           `v20` (obstacle): `(-0.195, 0.029)` to `(-0.093, 0.130)`
           
           **Rover v12 (at v13 (1.0, -1.75))**:
           - **Image `v17` & `v18` at `#o3`**:
               - `v17` is in the upper-left, `v18` is in the upper-right.
               - `v12` is in the lower-right.
               - To see `v17` (`x` around -0.6), `v12` needs to move left, possibly crossing `v19`. This is difficult without specific path motions.
               - To see `v18` (`x` around 0.6), `v12` is already on the right side of `v19`. A configuration like `(0.7, 1.0)` might work for line-of-sight to `v18`. This is far from `v13`.
               - Let's rethink. Is it possible to use `v14` for imaging `v17`? `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). `v17` is `(-0.685, 2.148)`. A config like `(-0.6, 1.0)` for `#o3` of `v14` could work for `v17`. This config is reachable from `v15` and avoids `v19` and `v20`.
               - For `v18` (`(0.622, 1.986)`), `v14` would need to cross `v19`. So `v12` should handle `v18`. A config like `(0.7, 1.0)` for `#o3` of `v12` would allow imaging `v18`. This is `1.0` distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) which should be fine.
               - So, `v14` for `v17` image, `v12` for `v18` image. This splits the imaging task.
           
           - **Sample `v1` (type v2) at `#o5`**:
               - `v1` is at `(1.049, -0.656)`. `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. This is very close. A configuration like `(1.1, -0.6)` should be reachable, collision-free (not near any obstacles), and above `v1`.
           
           - **Communicate with `v9` at `#o0`**:
               - `v9` is at `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
               - `v12` (at `(1.0, -1.75)`) cannot establish line-of-sight with `v9` without crossing `v19`. If the `motion` predicates imply reachability even across `v19`, then I need a config on the left side. Let's assume this is not allowed. So `v12` cannot communicate.
               - This means `v14` must communicate for `v12`'s images/analyses too, but this requires a transfer action, which doesn't exist.
               - This again points to the goal being unachievable if `v12` and `v14` cannot cross the `x=0` barrier (`v19`) to transmit.
           
           Let me reconsider the problem statement about `#` parameters and collision-free line of sight and reachability. The `motion` predicates imply reachability.
           The obstacle `v19` is a thin wall from `x=-0.05` to `x=0.05`. If a ray can pass through `x` values between `-0.05` and `0.05`, then it can be line-of-sight. However, robot's base cannot pass through `v19`. The configuration for the robot must be collision-free. This implies the robot must stay on one side of `v19`.
           
           If `v12` (right of `v19`) cannot communicate with `v9` (left of `v19`), and `v14` (left of `v19`) cannot image `v18` (right of `v19`) then the problem might be unachievable given this wall.
           
           However, the problem statement explicitly says: "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is *false*." And there are `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` in the initial state. This *must* mean that there exist valid configurations for these, implying that either:
           1. `v19` is not an impenetrable barrier for line-of-sight/movement at certain points.
           2. The `motion` predicates allow movement across `v19`.
           
           Given the previous errors regarding reachability, I need to choose configurations that are "closer" to the initial rover position, keeping in mind the obstacles.
           
           **Let's assume the `motion` predicates for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` allow crossing `v19` if the final configuration is valid.** This is the only way to make the problem solvable given the `comvisible` and `imagevisible` predicates.
           
           **Revised Strategy:**
           - Use `v12` for all imaging and analysis that starts on the right side of `v19`.
           - Use `v14` for all imaging and analysis that starts on the left side of `v19`.
           - Both rovers must be able to communicate with `v9`.
           
           **Rover v12 (at v13 (1.0, -1.75))**:
           1. **Images `v17` and `v18`**:
              - `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` are given.
              - For `v17` (around `(-0.6, 2.1)`) and `v18` (around `(0.7, 2.0)`).
              - A single `#o3` for `v12` viewing both `v17` and `v18` is tricky because `v17` is left of `v19` and `v18` is right of `v19`.
              - The initial state lists `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` AND `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`. This implies a single `#o3` for `v12` to see *both*. This is impossible with `v19` as a wall.
              - I must have misinterpreted the `new-axiom@0()`.
                - `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`. One rover does not need to get both images.
                - `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` are plausible.
           
           Let's adjust the plan assuming `v12` images `v18`, `v14` images `v17`.
           And `v12` samples `v1` (type `v2`), `v14` samples `v5` (type `v6`).
           Both must be able to communicate with `v9`.
           
           **Rover v12 (at v13 (1.0, -1.75))**:
           - **Image `v18` (`(0.6, 2.0)`)**: Need `#o3_v12_v18`. From (1.0, -1.75) to (0.7, 1.0). This looks reachable and collision-free.
           - **Sample `v1` (`(1.1, -0.6)`)**: Need `#o5_v12_v1`. From (1.0, -1.75) to (1.1, -0.6). This looks reachable and collision-free.
           - **Communicate to `v9` (`(-1.9, -2.0)`)**: Need `#o0_v12_v9`. From (1.0, -1.75) to (-1.5, -1.0). This *must* be reachable based on `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o0)`. The config `(-1.5, -1.0)` is to the left of `v19` and visible to `v9`. This configuration must also be collision-free.
           
           **Rover v14 (at v15 (-1.0, -1.75))**:
           - **Image `v17` (`(-0.6, 2.1)`)**: Need `#o3_v14_v17`. From (-1.0, -1.75) to (-0.6, 1.0). This looks reachable and collision-free.
           - **Sample `v5` (`(-1.6, -0.6)`)**: Need `#o5_v14_v5`. From (-1.0, -1.75) to (-1.6, -0.6). This looks reachable and collision-free.
           - **Communicate to `v9` (`(-1.9, -2.0)`)**: Need `#o0_v14_v9`. From (-1.0, -1.75) to (-1.5, -1.0). This is very close and looks reachable and collision-free.
           
           Let's try these specific values. I'm choosing values close to previous ones but ensuring they're clearly within a reachable and collision-free quadrant relative to the starting position and target.
           
           **Plan (revised based on distribution of tasks and new configs):**
           1. `v12` moves to a config to image `v18`.
           2. `v12` calibrates for `v18`.
           3. `v12` takes image of `v18`.
           4. `v12` moves to a config to sample `v1`.
           5. `v12` samples `v1`.
           6. `v12` moves to a config to communicate with `v9`.
           7. `v12` sends image of `v18`.
           8. `v12` sends analysis of `v1`.
           
           9. `v14` moves to a config to image `v17`.
           10. `v14` calibrates for `v17`.
           11. `v14` takes image of `v17`.
           12. `v14` moves to a config to sample `v5`.
           13. `v14` samples `v5`.
           14. `v14` moves to a config to communicate with `v9`.
           15. `v14` sends image of `v17`.
           16. `v14` sends analysis of `v5`.
           
           This plan still has an issue with `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)` that needs *both* to be true. If `v12` images `v18` and `v14` images `v17`, then `v12` cannot send `v17`'s image, and `v14` cannot send `v18`'s image unless there is a transfer action.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` implies:
           `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for type `v2`
           `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for type `v6`
           
           Let's re-read carefully: `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` are in the initial state. This implies `v12` *can* see both `v17` AND `v18` from *the same* configuration `#o3`. This means that `#o3` for `v12` cannot be blocked by `v19` for either `v17` or `v18`. A possible solution is if `#o3` is at `x=0`, and the view frustum somehow avoids `v19`, or if `v19` is not a ray blocker. Given `v19` is a thin wall, it's a very narrow obstacle. But it's `blocked(#o4)` due to `~test-cfree-ray-conf-negative(#o4, v12, #o3)` where `v19` is the obstacle.
           It might be that `v19` is only blocking paths, but not rays, or that specific ray #o4 is not blocked.
           Let's assume there exists a `#o3` for `v12` that can see both `v17` and `v18`. This would likely be a position *behind* `v19` (from the perspective of `v12` at `v13`) or far away.
           A config like `(0.0, 2.0)` is directly on `v19` and blocked.
           
           This problem is highly dependent on the "geometry of the scene" and "reachable" definitions. If the provided `motion` predicates literally mean "reachable configuration," and `imagevisible/comvisible` mean "occlusion-free line-of-sight," then specific values for `#o*` must be found.
           
           Let's assume the continuous values given in the initial state for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` implicitly describe valid, collision-free, and reachable configurations, and I just need to use them. The error message explicitly states that previous configuration *values* were not reachable. So I need to pick new values.
           
           Let's try to keep all work to the side of the obstacle `v19` that each rover is on, and only use the "crossing" motion if absolutely necessary and only if I can find a configuration that can be explained as collision-free/occlusion-free.
           
           **Rover v12 (at v13 (1.0, -1.75) - Right side of v19)**:
           - **Image `v18`**: Target `v18` is `(0.6, 2.0)`. A config like `(0.7, 1.0)` for `#o3_v12_v18` is suitable. Reachable from `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           - **Sample `v1` (type v2)**: Target `v1` is `(1.1, -0.6)`. A config like `(1.1, -0.6)` for `#o5_v12_v1` is suitable. Reachable from `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           - **Communicate to `v9`**: Target `v9` is `(-1.9, -2.0)`. This requires `v12` to be on the left side of `v19`. The only way this makes sense is if the `motion` from `v13` to `#o0` implies a complex path around or through a gap in `v19` that is not visible in the AABB description. Given `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` exists, let's pick a collision-free point on the left side: `(-1.0, -1.5)` for `#o0_v12_v9`. This is close to `v15` for `v14`.
           
           **Rover v14 (at v15 (-1.0, -1.75) - Left side of v19)**:
           - **Image `v17`**: Target `v17` is `(-0.6, 2.1)`. A config like `(-0.6, 1.0)` for `#o3_v14_v17` is suitable. Reachable from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           - **Sample `v5` (type v6)**: Target `v5` is `(-1.6, -0.6)`. A config like `(-1.6, -0.6)` for `#o5_v14_v5` is suitable. Reachable from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           - **Communicate to `v9`**: Target `v9` is `(-1.9, -2.0)`. A config like `(-1.0, -1.5)` for `#o0_v14_v9` is suitable. Reachable from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           
           **Consolidated Plan using split tasks and distinct config values:**
           Let `#o3_v12_v18` be for imaging `v18` by `v12`.
           Let `#o5_v12_v1` be for sampling `v1` by `v12`.
           Let `#o0_v12_v9` be for communicating to `v9` by `v12`.
           Let `#o3_v14_v17` be for imaging `v17` by `v14`.
           Let `#o5_v14_v5` be for sampling `v5` by `v14`.
           Let `#o0_v14_v9` be for communicating to `v9` by `v14`.
           
           Now, the plan:
           1. `v12` calibrates and images `v18`.
           2. `v12` samples `v1`.
           3. `v12` moves to `v9` and sends its image and analysis.
           4. `v14` calibrates and images `v17`.
           5. `v14` samples `v5`.
           6. `v14` moves to `v9` and sends its image and analysis.
           
           This will ensure all `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates are satisfied.

Configuration #o5 = (-1.6 -0.6) for rover v14 at target v5 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-1.0 -1.5) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The configurations I provided are consistently being rejected as unreachable, despite using `motion` predicates that imply reachability for these abstract `#o` parameters. This suggests that the actual Euclidean distance or path constraints are more restrictive than what the presence of `motion(rover, start_conf, traj, end_conf)` implies on its own. It's possible that the "reachable" check considers intermediate points along a path, and there are unstated obstacles or bounds that restrict movement.
           
           Given the error is consistently "not reachable for robot base," I need to find configuration coordinates that are *very close* to the rover's initial position or very close to other known valid configurations (like `v13` or `v15`).
           
           Let's re-examine the given `motion` predicates. Notice that the third parameter `#o2` is constant for all motion actions. This implies a generic trajectory type rather than a specific path. The crucial part is that the `motion` predicates for `v12` from `v13` to `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` exist, and similarly for `v14` from `v15`. This *should* mean they are reachable. The continuous values I provide for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` *must* be compatible with this implicit reachability.
           
           Let's try to choose configurations that are extremely close to the starting point of each rover, or to existing valid configurations, while still satisfying the visibility/above predicates. This will minimize the "reachability" distance.
           
           **Rover v12 (at v13 (1.0, -1.75))**:
           - **Image `v18` (`(0.6, 2.0)`)**: To minimize movement, `v12` should move as little as possible. `v18` is still pretty far away. Maybe staying at `v13` for `#o3`?
               - `imagevisible(v12, v13, #o4, v18)`: The current `v13` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. `v18` is at `(0.622, 1.986)`. This distance is around `sqrt((1.0-0.622)^2 + (-1.75-1.986)^2) = sqrt(0.378^2 + (-3.736)^2) = sqrt(0.142 + 13.957) approx 3.75`. This is less than 4 (comrange) but likely greater than 2 (imagerange). The initial state says `imagerange(v12, #o3, v18)`. If `#o3` were `v13`, it might be out of range. So I must move `v12`.
               - Let's try `#o3 = (0.7, 0.0)`. This is closer to `v18` (`(0.6, 2.0)`) and further from `v13` (1.0, -1.75). Distance from `v13` is `sqrt((1.0-0.7)^2 + (-1.75-0.0)^2) = sqrt(0.3^2 + 1.75^2) = sqrt(0.09 + 3.06) approx 1.77`. This is a shorter move.
           - **Sample `v1` (type v2)**: Target `v1` is `(1.049, -0.656)`. `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75) is close.
               - Let's try `#o5 = (1.05, -0.6)`. Distance from `v13` is `sqrt((1.0-1.05)^2 + (-1.75-(-0.6))^2) = sqrt((-0.05)^2 + (-1.15)^2) = sqrt(0.0025 + 1.3225) approx 1.15`. This should be very reachable.
           - **Communicate to `v9` (`(-1.9, -2.0)`)**: `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). To reach `(-1.0, -1.5)` (my previous attempt) from `(1.0, -1.75)` means a movement across `x=0`. This might be the issue.
               - If `v12` *must* communicate with `v9` (on the other side of `v19`), then the distance/reachability constraint is very strict.
               - What if `v9` has a "wide" communication range that bypasses `v19` if `v12` is far enough away? But the `comvisible` predicate has a ray.
               - Let's assume the `motion` predicates allow the rover to 'teleport' or have extremely capable movement. If *any* config `#o0` for `v12` to `v9` is reachable, it will be the one closest to `v13` that also has line of sight to `v9`. `v9` is at `(-1.9,-2.0)`. The closest point on the left of `v19` to `v13` is `(-0.05, -1.75)`. But from here the ray to `v9` is blocked by `v19` itself.
               - It's highly probable the environment setup means `v12` CANNOT communicate with `v9` if `v19` is a total barrier for line of sight and movement. But the initial state explicitly has `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`. This is a contradiction. The only way to resolve this is if `v19` does not completely block all lines of sight/movement, or my interpretation of "reachable" and "blocked" is flawed relative to the automated checker.
           
           Let's assume the continuous values for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` *must* be some configuration that is known to the system already, or that are extremely close to existing named configurations. The provided configurations `v13` and `v15` are base configurations.
           The initial state also has:
           `conf(v12, #o3)`
           `conf(v12, #o5)`
           `conf(v12, #o0)`
           `conf(v14, #o3)`
           `conf(v14, #o5)`
           `conf(v14, #o0)`
           
           This means the values for these continuous parameters are *not* arbitrary; they are specific continuous values that already exist and are named. The problem statement says: "Any object that starts with a '#' represents a *continuous parameter* (e.g., a trajectory, or a pose) that has not yet been computed." However, it then continues: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate... then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration..." This implies I *do* need to provide values.
           
           The repeated "not reachable" errors, even for small moves, points to a fundamental misunderstanding of the allowed configuration space or reachability. Perhaps the `motion` predicates are not just about "some path exists" but specify actual path segments between specific, pre-computed configurations that happen to be named `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` etc. in the initial state. If `conf(v12, #o0)` exists, then `#o0` refers to a specific, pre-computed continuous value that is collision-free and reachable from `v12`'s initial position (`v13`).
           
           If the `#o` configurations are already pre-computed as reachable and collision-free by the system and available to the `motion` predicates, then I should simply reference them. The problem states "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') ... then you must provide a continuous value...". This is a contradiction if the system already knows these values and is checking them.
           
           Let's interpret the error to mean that the *values I provided* for #o* were not reachable. I must pick coordinates that are *known* to be reachable by the underlying continuous motion planner. The only way to guarantee this without more information is to pick values that are extremely close to the rover's current location, or to known "safe" locations that have been tested.
           
           Let's use very conservative (small delta) moves for reachability.
           **Rover v12 (at v13 (1.0, -1.75))**:
           - **Image `v18` (`(0.6, 2.0)`)**: Requires line-of-sight and range. `v13` to `(0.7, 1.0)` was `1.77` distance move. Maybe too far? What about `(1.0, 0.0)` for `#o3`? Distance from `v13` `sqrt(0^2 + (-1.75-0)^2) = 1.75`. `v18` is `(0.6, 2.0)`. Ray from `(1.0, 0.0)` to `(0.6, 2.0)` should be fine (no `v19` obstruction). Distance from `(1.0, 0.0)` to `v18` is `sqrt((1.0-0.6)^2 + (0.0-2.0)^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 4) = sqrt(4.16) approx 2.04`. This satisfies range < 2.
           - **Sample `v1` (`(1.1, -0.6)`)**: A configuration like `(1.0, -0.7)` for `#o5`. Distance from `v13` is `sqrt(0^2 + (-1.75-(-0.7))^2) = sqrt((-1.05)^2) = 1.05`. This should be very reachable. `v1` is at `(1.049, -0.656)`. So `(1.0, -0.7)` is close to it.
           - **Communicate to `v9` (`(-1.9, -2.0)`)**: This requires crossing `v19`. I need to pick a configuration `#o0` for `v12` that is on the *left* side of `v19` but is still considered reachable from `v13`. Let's use `(-0.1, -1.75)`. This is just to the left of `v19` at the same `y` as `v13`. Distance from `v13` is `sqrt((1.0-(-0.1))^2 + (-1.75-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(1.1^2 + 0^2) = 1.1`. Line of sight to `v9` from `(-0.1, -1.75)`: `v9` center `(-1.9, -2.0)`. Ray is clear of `v20`. Distance from `(-0.1, -1.75)` to `v9` is `sqrt((-0.1-(-1.9))^2 + (-1.75-(-2.0))^2) = sqrt(1.8^2 + 0.25^2) = sqrt(3.24 + 0.0625) approx 1.81`. This is within `comrange < 4`.
           
           **Rover v14 (at v15 (-1.0, -1.75))**:
           - **Image `v17` (`(-0.6, 2.1)`)**: Let's try `(-1.0, 0.0)` for `#o3`. Distance from `v15` is `sqrt(0^2 + (-1.75-0)^2) = 1.75`. `v17` is `(-0.6, 2.1)`. Ray from `(-1.0, 0.0)` to `(-0.6, 2.1)` should be fine (no `v19` obstruction). Distance from `(-1.0, 0.0)` to `v17` is `sqrt((-1.0-(-0.6))^2 + (0.0-2.1)^2) = sqrt((-0.4)^2 + (-2.1)^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 4.41) = sqrt(4.57) approx 2.13`. This is slightly outside `imagerange < 2`.
               - I need a configuration closer to `v17`. What about `(-0.6, 1.0)`? Distance from `v15` is `sqrt((-1.0-(-0.6))^2 + (-1.75-1.0)^2) = sqrt((-0.4)^2 + (-2.75)^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 7.56) approx 2.78`. This was previously rejected for reachability.
               - Let's try `(-0.7, 0.5)` for `#o3`. Distance from `v15` `sqrt((-1.0-(-0.7))^2 + (-1.75-0.5)^2) = sqrt((-0.3)^2 + (-2.25)^2) = sqrt(0.09 + 5.06) approx 2.27`.
               - Let's try using `v12` for *both* images. If `v12` can reach `(-0.1, -1.75)` for communication, it can reach `(-0.7, 0.5)` for imaging `v17` as well.
               - If `v12` does both images, then for `v17` `(-0.6, 2.1)`: configuration `(-0.7, 0.5)` for `#o3`. Distance from `v13` is `sqrt((1.0-(-0.7))^2 + (-1.75-0.5)^2) = sqrt(1.7^2 + (-2.25)^2) = sqrt(2.89 + 5.06) approx 2.8`. Still might be too far.
               - This is very difficult if small displacements are "not reachable".
           
           What if the `#o` configurations are specific, pre-computed locations from the very beginning that are *not* defined by my choice, but referenced by the `conf(rover, #name)` predicates? And if so, why do I have to provide values? This implies I need to provide *the same* pre-computed value.
           Let's assume the continuous values for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are actually `v13`, `v15`, or some other pre-defined configs that are very close.
           
           Let's check:
           - `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`.
           - `above(v12, #o5, v1)`, `above(v12, #o5, v5)` (and others).
           - `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`.
           
           And similar for `v14`. This means `#o3` for `v12` *must* be able to see both `v17` and `v18`. This is very unlikely across `v19`.
           
           This leads to the conclusion that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable under my current understanding of the environment and "reachability".
           
           However, I must assume the problem is solvable and that there is a set of valid configurations. The most common pitfall is misunderstanding the environment.
           
           Let's assume `v19` (x=0 wall) does not impede line of sight for `imagevisible` and `comvisible` at certain y-heights, or that the `ray` parameter indicates a path that avoids the primary blockade.
           
           If the "reachable" check is strict on euclidean distance, and I am not given any other "safe" configurations, then small movements are key.
           
           Let's try to assign a *single* configuration for each type of #o variable per rover, and keep these as close as possible to the rover's initial position.
           
           **Rover v12 (at v13 (1.0, -1.75))**:
           - **#o3 (for image targets `v17`, `v18`)**: Since `v17` is left of `v19` and `v18` is right of `v19`, a single configuration `#o3` for `v12` seeing both is very difficult. This setup leads to the assumption that `v19` is not a total visual barrier. If it is, then `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` is false.
               - Let's assume `v12` handles `v18` only, and `v14` handles `v17` only.
               - So for `v12` and `v18` `(0.6, 2.0)`: Try `#o3 = (0.7, 0.0)` for `v12`. Distance from `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)` is `1.77`.
           - **#o5 (for `v1` (type v2))**: `v1` is `(1.1, -0.6)`. Try `#o5 = (1.0, -0.7)` for `v12`. Distance from `v13` is `1.05`.
           - **#o0 (for `v9` communication)**: `v9` is `(-1.9, -2.0)`. Let's try to move just across `v19`. `#o0 = (-0.1, -1.75)` for `v12`. Distance from `v13` is `1.1`.
           
           **Rover v14 (at v15 (-1.0, -1.75))**:
           - **#o3 (for `v17` (objective))**: `v17` is `(-0.6, 2.1)`. Try `#o3 = (-1.0, 0.0)` for `v14`. Distance from `v15` is `1.75`.
           - **#o5 (for `v5` (type v6))**: `v5` is `(-1.6, -0.6)`. Try `#o5 = (-1.0, -0.7)` for `v14`. Distance from `v15` is `1.05`.
           - **#o0 (for `v9` communication)**: `v9` is `(-1.9, -2.0)`. Try `#o0 = (-1.0, -1.5)` for `v14`. Distance from `v15` is `0.25`. This should definitely be reachable.
           
           If these configurations are rejected again as "not reachable", then the "reachable" condition is much stricter than simple euclidean distance and assumes some very specific fixed path that my values don't align with.
           If the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates in the initial state are true, then the required configurations *do* exist and are reachable. My task is to find them.
           
           Let me try to assign unique names for all `#o` parameters, even if they have the same type, to avoid any ambiguity.
           - `#o3_v12_v18`: For `v12` imaging `v18`.
           - `#o5_v12_v1`: For `v12` sampling `v1`.
           - `#o0_v12_v9`: For `v12` communicating with `v9`.
           - `#o3_v14_v17`: For `v14` imaging `v17`.
           - `#o5_v14_v5`: For `v14` sampling `v5`.
           - `#o0_v14_v9`: For `v14` communicating with `v9`.

Model:     The previous attempt again failed on reachability for all configurations, and introduced new collision errors for `#o0` of `v12` (with `v19`) and `#o5` of `v14` (with a new obstacle `v21`). This is getting very challenging, as my understanding of "reachable" and "collision-free" doesn't align with the underlying simulator. The strictness on reachability even for small displacements, combined with new obstacles being revealed, means I need to be extremely precise.
           
           Obstacle `v21`: AABB(lower=(-1.28, -0.89), upper=(-1.16, -0.78)). This is a small block in the lower-left quadrant.
           
           Let's re-evaluate all configurations, focusing on being very close to the rover's starting points (`v13` for `v12`, `v15` for `v14`) and avoiding all obstacles.
           
           **Rover v12 (at v13 (1.0, -1.75))**:
           - **#o3 (for image targets `v18`)**: `v18` is `(0.622, 1.986)`. My previous choice `(1.0, 0.0)` for `#o3` was not reachable.
               - Let's try to stay *even closer* to `v13`. Maybe just move in `y`.
               - `(1.0, -1.0)`: Distance from `v13` is `0.75`. Line-of-sight to `v18` `(0.6, 2.0)` from `(1.0, -1.0)`: ray is from `(1.0, -1.0)` to `(0.6, 2.0)`. Obstacles: `v19` (x=0 wall), `v20` (block at `(-0.19, 0.02)`). No collision with `v19` or `v20`. Distance to `v18` `sqrt((1.0-0.6)^2 + (-1.0-2.0)^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 9) = sqrt(9.16) approx 3.02`. This is too far for `imagerange < 2`.
               - This means `v12` needs to move significantly. If even `(1.0, 0.0)` is not reachable, then the reachable region from `v13` might be very small.
               - Let's revisit the possibility that the `#o` configurations are themselves *named* pre-computed reachable points. If I use a `#o` that is already in the `initial state`, e.g., `conf(v12, #o3)` already exists, then I should simply use `#o3` (and the system's computed value for it). The problem statement, however, requires *me* to provide values. This is a conflicting instruction.
           
           Let's stick to the interpretation that I must provide values and those values have to be collision-free and reachable. "Reachable" must refer to a very limited local movement.
           This implies `v12` might not be able to image `v18` if `v18` is too far, unless `v12` can use a long `motion` that's not restricted by simple Euclidean distance. But the error message implies distance.
           
           Is it possible that only `v13` and `v15` are reachable configurations, and I cannot define new ones? No, because the `motion` predicates explicitly say `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)`. `#o3` is a different configuration.
           
           This is a deadlock. If I cannot find configurations that are both reachable AND satisfy visibility/above constraints, the task is unachievable. The task *must* be achievable.
           
           Let's look at the given `conf` predicates:
           `conf(v12, v13)`
           `conf(v14, v15)`
           `conf(v12, #o3)`, `conf(v12, #o5)`, `conf(v12, #o0)`
           `conf(v14, #o3)`, `conf(v14, #o5)`, `conf(v14, #o0)`
           
           This confirms that `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are *already* defined continuous parameters in the initial state. The problem explicitly tells me to provide values for them if they are used in `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicates. This means the values provided by the problem are internal and for evaluation, but *I* need to specify the values for my plan.
           
           Let's take a drastic approach. What if the "reachable" range is extremely small?
           **Rover v12 (at v13 (1.0, -1.75))**:
           - **#o3 (for `v18` (`(0.6, 2.0)`))**: The target `v18` is quite far. If `v12` must stay very close to `v13`, it cannot image `v18`. This suggests `v12` is not intended to image `v18`.
           - **#o5 (for `v1` (`(1.1, -0.6)`))**: `v1` is relatively close. Try `#o5 = (1.0, -0.8)`. Distance from `v13` is `sqrt(0^2 + (-1.75 - (-0.8))^2) = 0.95`. This is a very small move. Collision free. It's above `v1` given `v1` is small.
           - **#o0 (for `v9` (`(-1.9, -2.0)`)**: My last config `(-0.1, -1.75)` collided with `v19`. I need to be further left of `v19`. Let's try `(-0.2, -1.75)`. Still very close to `v13`. Distance from `v13` is `sqrt((1.0 - (-0.2))^2 + 0^2) = 1.2`. Line of sight to `v9` should be fine. Collision-free.
           
           **Rover v14 (at v15 (-1.0, -1.75))**:
           - **#o3 (for `v17` (`(-0.6, 2.1)`)**: Target `v17` is also quite far. `(-1.0, 0.0)` was not reachable. This implies `v14` cannot image `v17`.
           - **#o5 (for `v5` (`(-1.6, -0.6)`)**: My last config `(-1.0, -0.7)` collided with `v21`. `v21` is at `((-1.28, -0.89), (-1.16, -0.78))`. So, the `x` range for collision is roughly `-1.28` to `-1.16`. My config `(-1.0, -0.7)` was at x=-1.0, which is outside the x-range of `v21`. The problem says it collided, which is odd based on the AABB. Perhaps it's a "larger" obstruction or the collision check is more complex.
               - Let's choose a position for `#o5` that is definitely not in the region of `v21`. `v5` is at `((-1.64, -0.67), (-1.5, -0.53))`. So I need to be left of `v21` in x, and around `v5` in y. Let's try `(-1.6, -0.8)`. This is very close to `v5`. Distance from `v15` is `sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.6))^2 + (-1.75 - (-0.8))^2) = sqrt(0.6^2 + (-0.95)^2) = sqrt(0.36 + 0.90) approx 1.12`. This should be reachable.
           - **#o0 (for `v9` (`(-1.9, -2.0)`)**: My last config `(-1.0, -1.5)` was not reachable. This is extremely close to `v15` (`(-1.0, -1.75)`). Distance is `0.25`. If this isn't reachable, then only `v15` itself is reachable. This is a very restrictive environment.
               - If `v15` is the only reachable config, let's try to use `v15` for `#o0`.
               - `comvisible(v14, v15, #o1, v9)`: Check line of sight from `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `v9` `(-1.9, -2.0)`. No obstacles `v19`, `v20`, `v21` in the way. Distance `sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.9))^2 + (-1.75 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt(0.9^2 + 0.25^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 0.0625) = sqrt(0.8725) approx 0.93`. This is within `comrange < 4`. This could work.
           
           The crucial information about the `imagevisible` predicates:
           `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` (This one is problematic if `v19` blocks `v17` from the right side)
           `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`
           `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` (This one is problematic if `v19` blocks `v18` from the left side)
           
           The repeated pattern of `imagevisible(rover, #o3, #o4, objective)` for *both* objectives and *both* rovers suggests that the `#o3` configuration may be designed to allow one rover to see both objectives. But this seems impossible due to `v19`.
           
           This implies a misunderstanding of `blocked(?y)` or `test-cfree-ray-conf-negative`.
           If `v19` (x=0 wall) does block, then `v12` cannot see `v17`, and `v14` cannot see `v18`.
           This means:
           - `v12` can image `v18`.
           - `v14` can image `v17`.
           
           My plan uses this split already.
           
           Let's try the absolute minimum movement, potentially using `v13` and `v15` as configs directly if possible.
           Can `v12` image `v18` at `v13`? `imagerange < 2`. Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `v18` (0.6, 2.0) is `3.75`. No.
           Can `v14` image `v17` at `v15`? `imagerange < 2`. Distance from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `v17` (-0.6, 2.1) is `3.87`. No.
           
           So, some movement is definitely needed.
           
           Let's reconsider the coordinate ranges for obstacles.
           `v19`: x from -0.05 to 0.05.
           `v20`: x from -0.19 to -0.09. y from 0.02 to 0.13.
           `v21`: x from -1.28 to -1.16. y from -0.89 to -0.78.
           
           Revised plan:
           **Rover v12 (at v13 (1.0, -1.75))**:
           - **#o3 (for `v18`)**: Let's try `(0.7, 0.1)`. Distance from `v13` `sqrt((1.0-0.7)^2 + (-1.75-0.1)^2) = sqrt(0.09 + 3.42) approx 1.87`. This is quite far but within reach limit if it's strict. Distance to `v18` from `(0.7, 0.1)`: `sqrt((0.7-0.6)^2 + (0.1-2.0)^2) = sqrt(0.01 + 3.61) approx 1.90`. This is good for image range. Collision free.
           - **#o5 (for `v1`)**: `v1` is `(1.049, -0.656)`. Let's try `(1.0, -0.7)`. Distance from `v13` is `1.05`. Collision free.
           - **#o0 (for `v9`)**: `v9` is `(-1.9, -2.0)`. Need to cross `v19`. Let's move just past `v19`. Try `(-0.1, -1.70)`. This is outside the AABB of `v19` for X, and slightly shifted in Y. Distance from `v13` `sqrt((1.0-(-0.1))^2 + (-1.75-(-1.70))^2) = sqrt(1.1^2 + (-0.05)^2) = sqrt(1.21 + 0.0025) approx 1.10`. Line of sight to `v9` should be fine.
           
           **Rover v14 (at v15 (-1.0, -1.75))**:
           - **#o3 (for `v17`)**: `v17` is `(-0.6, 2.1)`. Let's try `(-0.7, 0.1)`. Distance from `v15` `sqrt((-1.0-(-0.7))^2 + (-1.75-0.1)^2) = sqrt(0.09 + 3.42) approx 1.87`. Distance to `v17` from `(-0.7, 0.1)`: `sqrt((-0.7-(-0.6))^2 + (0.1-2.1)^2) = sqrt(0.01 + 4.0) approx 2.0`. This is just barely in range for image. Collision free (not near `v19` or `v20`).
           - **#o5 (for `v5`)**: `v5` is `(-1.64, -0.67)`. My last config `(-1.0, -0.7)` was rejected for `v21`. `v21` is between `x=-1.28` and `x=-1.16`. So `(-1.0, -0.7)` was to the right of `v21`. `v5` is to the left of `v21`. So I need `x` values for `#o5` to be less than `-1.28`. Let's try `(-1.6, -0.8)`. Distance from `v15` `sqrt((-1.0-(-1.6))^2 + (-1.75-(-0.8))^2) = sqrt(0.36 + 0.90) approx 1.12`. This should be safe from `v21` and near `v5`.
           - **#o0 (for `v9`)**: `v9` is `(-1.9, -2.0)`. My last config `(-1.0, -1.5)` was not reachable. This is extremely close. Let's try moving to `(-1.0, -1.6)`. Distance from `v15` is `sqrt(0^2 + (-1.75-(-1.6))^2) = 0.15`. This is a tiny move. Line of sight to `v9` is fine.
           
           Let's try this refined set of configurations.

Configuration #o0 = (-1.0 -1.6) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The "not reachable" errors persist, indicating that my understanding of allowed movement is fundamentally flawed within this simulated environment. The small movements I'm proposing are still not considered reachable. The collision with `v19` for `v12` at `(-0.1, -1.70)` means my interpretation of `v19`'s AABB (`lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1)`) is too loose; the obstacle is effectively wider or its influence extends beyond its strict AABB.
           
           Since the problem requires me to provide continuous values for `#` parameters that are given in `conf(rover, #name)` and also used in `imagevisible` or `comvisible`, and `motion(rover, start, #o2, end)` is present, there must be *some* valid configurations. The only way to bypass the "not reachable" problem when even small deltas fail is if the `#o*` parameters are actually fixed, pre-defined points in the environment, and my task is to discover *which* of these pre-defined configurations work. This would imply that the system has already computed collision-free, reachable configurations for these named `#` objects.
           
           If the `#` objects are fixed, pre-computed configurations, then my role is to use the *existing* `#o` configurations (e.g., `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` as defined internally by the problem, not by values I provide) in the action sequence. But the prompt explicitly states I *must provide values* for them. This contradiction is making it impossible to satisfy the "reachable" criteria.
           
           Let's make a strong assumption: The available `motion` predicates imply that the configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are *always* reachable from `v13` (for `v12`) or `v15` (for `v14`), and from each other. The 'not reachable' error comes from the *specific continuous values* I am providing, not from the abstract `#o` parameter itself. Therefore, the issue is that my chosen coordinates for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` are not valid.
           
           If the distance and collision are so strict, it might be that the only "reachable" coordinates are `v13` and `v15` themselves, or coordinates that result from some very specific movement primitive that's not clearly defined.
           
           Given that I must provide values, and all my attempts to find reachable values have failed, I'm going to try to use very, very specific, non-intuitive locations.
           Let's assume the valid continuous parameters for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are some internal fixed points that are reachable. Since I cannot know them, I will attempt to put them *extremely* close to existing reference points or target objects, assuming that any small, non-colliding displacement is "reachable".
           
           Final, last-ditch strategy: Place the configurations as close as possible to the *target objects* themselves, or to the rovers' current positions, as long as they are demonstrably collision-free. The issue of 'reachable' remains opaque, but by minimizing movement, I hope to increase the chances.
           
           **Rover v12 (at v13 (1.0, -1.75))**:
           - **#o3 (for `v18`)**: `v18` is `(0.622, 1.986)`. To be as close as possible, while being collision-free and seeing `v18`. Let's assume a point very close to `v18` that's not obstructed. This is the only way to satisfy `imagerange < 2`. Let's try `(0.65, 1.8)` for `#o3`. Distance from `v13` to `(0.65, 1.8)` is `sqrt((1.0-0.65)^2 + (-1.75-1.8)^2) = sqrt(0.1225 + 12.6025) approx 3.56`. This is a big move but maybe the specific (x,y) coordinates for `#o3` are far away.
           - **#o5 (for `v1`)**: `v1` is `(1.049, -0.656)`. Let's try `(1.05, -0.6)`. Distance from `v13` is `1.15`. Collision-free.
           - **#o0 (for `v9`)**: `v9` is `(-1.9, -2.0)`. My earlier `(-0.1, -1.70)` collided with `v19`. This implies `v19` is not just `(-0.05, 0.05)` in x, or the collision detection is very sensitive. Perhaps move further away from x=0. Try `(-0.2, -1.70)`. Distance from `v13` is `sqrt((1.0-(-0.2))^2 + (-1.75-(-1.70))^2) = sqrt(1.44 + 0.0025) approx 1.2`. Still a big move over x=0.
           
           **Rover v14 (at v15 (-1.0, -1.75))**:
           - **#o3 (for `v17`)**: `v17` is `(-0.685, 2.148)`. Let's try `(-0.7, 1.9)`. Distance from `v15` to `(-0.7, 1.9)` is `sqrt((-1.0-(-0.7))^2 + (-1.75-1.9)^2) = sqrt(0.09 + 13.32) approx 3.66`. This is also a significant move.
           - **#o5 (for `v5`)**: `v5` is `(-1.641, -0.676)`. My previous `(-1.6, -0.8)` was not reachable. This is extremely close to `v5`. `v21` is at `((-1.28, -0.89), (-1.16, -0.78))`. Let's try `(-1.6, -0.6)`. This is to the left and above `v21`. Distance from `v15` `sqrt((-1.0-(-1.6))^2 + (-1.75-(-0.6))^2) = sqrt(0.36 + 1.32) approx 1.3`.
           - **#o0 (for `v9`)**: `v9` is `(-1.9, -2.0)`. `(-1.0, -1.6)` was not reachable. This is a very small displacement. Let's try `(-1.5, -1.8)`. This is also close to `v15` but also closer to `v9`. Distance from `v15` is `sqrt((-1.0-(-1.5))^2 + (-1.75-(-1.8))^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.0025) approx 0.5`. Collision-free.
           
           This is my most precise attempt. If these coordinates are also rejected, the problem description contains a contradiction (reachable motion predicates vs. unreachable specific coordinates) or is missing critical information about the exact valid configuration coordinates or a different understanding of "reachable" and "collision-free."

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The errors are becoming more specific and indicate new obstacles, `v22` and `v23`, which were not present in the initial prompt or prior error messages. This continuous revelation of obstacles makes it incredibly difficult to find collision-free locations. Also, `v9` itself (the lander) is now reported as an obstacle for `v14`'s communication, which is paradoxical.
           
           Let's list all new and existing obstacles explicitly:
           - `v19`: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1)) (Thin wall at x=0)
           - `v20`: AABB(lower=(-0.195, 0.029), upper=(-0.093, 0.130)) (Small block upper-left)
           - `v21`: AABB(lower=(-1.28, -0.89), upper=(-1.16, -0.78)) (Small block lower-left)
           - `v22`: AABB(lower=(0.25, 1.75, 0.0), upper=(0.75, 2.25, 0.1)) (New block upper-right)
           - `v23`: AABB(lower=(-0.75, 1.75, 0.0), upper=(-0.25, 2.25, 0.1)) (New block upper-left)
           
           The error that `v9` itself (the lander, the target of communication) is an obstacle for `v14` at `(-1.5, -1.8)` is particularly confusing. This implies that the rover cannot occupy the same space as the lander (which is expected), but `(-1.5, -1.8)` is not within the AABB of `v9` (`((-2.404, -2.345), (-1.395, -1.654))`). This might mean the rover cannot be too close to `v9` or that the geometry is more complex than simple AABBs.
           
           Given the persistent "not reachable" errors even for very small displacements and new obstacles, it's clear my strategy for deriving coordinates is fundamentally mismatched with the environment's internal model. The only way to succeed is to assume there are very specific 'sweet spots' that are reachable and collision/occlusion-free. Since I cannot discover them through iterative guessing, and the problem explicitly demands that I provide values for these `#` configurations, I am in an impossible situation.
           
           However, I must assume a solution exists. The problem setter *must* have in mind a specific set of configurations that work. I have to try to reason backwards from the goals and obstacles, even with the partial information.
           
           Let's retry the simplest possible moves and configurations, using a very wide berth around all known obstacles.
           
           **Rover v12 (at v13 (1.0, -1.75))**:
           - **#o3 (for `v18`)**: `v18` (`(0.622, 1.986)`). New obstacle `v22` (`(0.25, 1.75)` to `(0.75, 2.25)`). My last choice `(0.65, 1.8)` was inside `v22`'s AABB.
               - I need to be above/below/left/right of `v22` to see `v18`. Let's try to be to the right of `v22`. `(0.8, 1.9)`. `v18` is still partially within `v22`.
               - This means `v18` might be obstructed from most angles. The only way is if `v12` is far enough away.
               - Let's try `(1.2, 0.0)`. Distance from `v13` `sqrt((1.0-1.2)^2 + (-1.75-0.0)^2) = sqrt(0.04 + 3.06) approx 1.76`. Reachable? Collision-free with `v19`, `v20`, `v21`, `v22`, `v23`. Yes. Line of sight to `v18` (`(0.6, 2.0)`): `v22` is in the way.
               - What if the rover is at `(0.0, -1.75)` for `#o3`? Still blocked by `v19` if it's there.
           
           This implies that I'm overthinking the geometry. The `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates in the initial state *must* imply valid configurations exist. The "not reachable" and "collision" errors mean my *chosen values* for these configurations are wrong.
           
           Let's use the coordinates of the rovers, `v13` and `v15`, as a baseline for determining 'reachable' coordinates.
           
           **Rover v12 (at v13 (1.0, -1.75))**:
           - **#o3 (for `v18`)**: Needs to see `v18` `(0.6, 2.0)` without `v22` (`(0.25, 1.75)` to `(0.75, 2.25)`) in the way. `v18` is inside `v22`. This means `v18` is part of `v22` or `v22` is covering `v18`. If `v18` is inside `v22`, then `v12` has to be able to "see through" `v22` or `v18` has a visible part. This is getting very specific.
               - If `v18` is inside `v22`, I need to position `v12` for an unobstructed view *to* `v18` but *not* *inside* `v22`.
               - Let's try `(1.0, 1.0)`. Distance from `v13` is `sqrt((1.0-1.0)^2 + (-1.75-1.0)^2) = 2.75`. Still a big move. Line-of-sight to `v18` (`(0.6, 2.0)`) from `(1.0, 1.0)`. Ray would pass over `v22` but `v22` is between rover and target.
               - This suggests that `v12` cannot image `v18` or `v17` due to `v22`/`v23`.
           
           This is a dead end. If the goal is truly achievable, the interpretation of the predicates and environment is completely off. The given `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` MUST imply that such a `#o3` configuration exists for `v12` to see `v18`. And that configuration must be reachable.
           
           The only way to move forward is to try using configurations that are *defined in the problem as `conf` predicates that are not `v13` or `v15`*. The only ones are `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`. But I am told to provide their values.
           
           Final attempt:
           Assume the obstacles `v19`, `v20`, `v21`, `v22`, `v23` are fixed.
           The positions `v13` and `v15` are rover start points.
           The problem implicitly states there *are* valid configurations for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` for both rovers.
           I need to pick configurations that are very close to targets, while staying out of obstacles.
           
           **Rover v12 (at v13 (1.0, -1.75))**:
           - **#o3 (for `v18`)**: `v18` `(0.6, 2.0)`, `v22` `(0.25, 1.75)` to `(0.75, 2.25)`. `v18` is within `v22`. To see `v18` (which is a point within `v22`), `v12` must be outside `v22`. Try `(0.8, 1.7)`. Distance from `v13` is `sqrt((1.0-0.8)^2 + (-1.75-1.7)^2) = sqrt(0.04 + 11.9) approx 3.45`. Still far.
           - **#o5 (for `v1`)**: `v1` `(1.049, -0.656)`. `(1.05, -0.6)` was not reachable. Try `(1.0, -1.0)`. Distance from `v13` is `0.75`. Collision-free.
           - **#o0 (for `v9`)**: `v9` `(-1.9, -2.0)`. `(-0.2, -1.70)` collided with `v19`. I must move further left of `v19`. Try `(-0.5, -1.70)`. Distance from `v13` is `sqrt((1.0-(-0.5))^2 + (-1.75-(-1.70))^2) = sqrt(2.25 + 0.0025) approx 1.5`.
           
           **Rover v14 (at v15 (-1.0, -1.75))**:
           - **#o3 (for `v17`)**: `v17` `(-0.6, 2.1)`, `v23` `(-0.75, 1.75)` to `(-0.25, 2.25)`. `v17` is within `v23`. Try `(-0.8, 1.7)`. Distance from `v15` is `sqrt((-1.0-(-0.8))^2 + (-1.75-1.7)^2) = sqrt(0.04 + 11.9) approx 3.45`.
           - **#o5 (for `v5`)**: `v5` `(-1.6, -0.6)`. `(-1.6, -0.6)` was not reachable. Try `(-1.0, -1.0)`. Distance from `v15` is `0.75`. Collision-free, but probably not "above" `v5`.
           - **#o0 (for `v9`)**: `v9` `(-1.9, -2.0)`. `(-1.5, -1.8)` collided with `v9`. This implies the rover cannot be too close to `v9`. Try `(-1.0, -1.5)`. Distance from `v15` is `0.25`. This is very close to `v15`.
           
           If this fails, I must conclude the problem is unachievable with the provided information and constraints. The consistent "not reachable" errors on small, seemingly logical displacements, and collision errors with newly revealed obstacles and even the target object (`v9`) itself, indicates a problem with the environment model or the constraints.

           Configuration #o5 = (-1.0 -1.0) for rover v14 at target v5 is not valid because the target is not visible from the rover's camera due to occlusion.
           Configuration #o0 = (-1.0 -1.5) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     I have made numerous attempts to find collision-free, reachable, and occlusion-free configurations, systematically adjusting the coordinates based on the error messages. Each iteration reveals new obstacles or stricter interpretations of reachability and visibility. The last attempt failed with:
           - `v12`'s `#o3` colliding with `v22` (expected, as `v18` is within `v22`).
           - `v12`'s `#o5` and `#o0` are not reachable.
           - `v14`'s `#o3` colliding with `v23` (expected, as `v17` is within `v23`).
           - `v14`'s `#o5` is not valid due to occlusion.
           - `v14`'s `#o0` is not reachable.
           
           The consistent failure, especially for "not reachable" for seemingly small or logical moves, and the new obstacle `v22` obscuring `v18` and `v23` obscuring `v17` (making them impossible to photograph if `v22`/`v23` are solid), leads me to believe the task is unachievable under the current interpretation of the environment and actions.
           
           The `imagevisible` predicates in the initial state (`imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`) strongly imply that such views *are* possible. If the obstacles `v22` and `v23` completely enclose `v18` and `v17` respectively, then these `imagevisible` predicates are false, contradicting the initial state. This is a fundamental inconsistency.
           
           Given that I must assume the goal *is* achievable, the only remaining possibility is that my understanding of the environment, especially the "reachable" and "blocked" conditions, is severely incorrect, or there is some unstated mechanism to bypass obstacles or that the provided AABBs for obstacles are for collision with the robot body, but not for ray casting. However, the `blocked` axiom explicitly refers to `test-cfree-ray-conf-negative`.
           
           If `v18` is inside `v22`, and `v17` is inside `v23`, it means taking an image is impossible unless:
           1. The robot can move *inside* `v22`/`v23` (which is highly unlikely for collision-free movement).
           2. `v22`/`v23` are not opaque (but are listed as "fixed obstacles").
           3. The specific ray `#o4` has a special property that allows it to bypass `v22`/`v23` (highly unlikely for a general ray).
           
           Given the consistent failure across multiple attempts and my inability to discern the 'correct' interpretation of reachability and environmental interaction from the error messages, I must conclude that with the available information and my current understanding, I cannot construct a valid plan. The core issue is the contradiction between the initial state implying visibility/reachability for `#o` configurations and the continuous rejection of all proposed concrete coordinates for these configurations.
           
           I cannot provide a plan that achieves the goal if the necessary conditions (collision-free, reachable, occlusion-free configurations) cannot be met based on the feedback. Therefore, I will state that the goal is not achievable.
           
           The goal is not achievable given the presented environment and constraints. The primary reasons are:
           1. Persistent "not reachable" errors for even small, seemingly logical displacements, suggesting a very restrictive and unstated definition of "reachable" that cannot be deduced from the problem description or explicit motion predicates.
           2. New obstacles (`v22`, `v23`) being introduced in subsequent error messages, which were not part of the initial scene description, making it impossible to plan for them proactively.
           3. The objectives `v17` and `v18` appearing to be completely enclosed by `v23` and `v22` respectively, which contradicts the initial state's `imagevisible` predicates for these objectives, making imaging impossible.
           4. The target lander `v9` being reported as an obstacle for `v14`'s communication configuration, despite the proposed configuration not overlapping with `v9`'s AABB.
           These inconsistencies make it impossible to find valid configurations that satisfy all preconditions.
