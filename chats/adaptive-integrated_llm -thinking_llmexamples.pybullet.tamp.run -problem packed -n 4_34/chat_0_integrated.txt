User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.098, 0.392), (0.19, 0.484)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.166, -0.318), (-0.087, -0.239)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.016, -0.443, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.565, 0.825).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.22, -0.193), (0.292, -0.121)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.144, 0.438, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.546, 0.838).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.127, -0.279, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.657, 0.754).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.256, -0.157, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.697, 0.717).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.029, -0.488), (0.061, -0.397)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Goal Reachability**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: getting objects v8, v12, v14, and v16 all placed on object v18.  Looking at the current state, I see that v8 is currently at v9, v12 is at v13, v14 is at v15, and v16 is at v17. All of them are supported by v11.  The objective demands that these objects be moved and placed onto v18.
           
           My immediate thought is, "I need to *pick* them up and *place* them down." This is the classic approach for this type of problem. However, the action instances available to me are severely limited.  The only allowed action is `move_base`.  `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` doesn't seem to do anything relevant; it just changes state in a way that doesn't advance my goal.
           
           Now, I analyze the predicates required to satisfy the goal: `on(v8, v18)`, `on(v12, v18)`, `on(v14, v18)`, and `on(v16, v18)`. These can only be achieved through `place` actions, which would have the form `atpose(?o, ?p)`. The *on* axiom dictates that to achieve *on(?o, ?r)*, I need `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`.  
           
           Given the initial state, I can see that `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` are already supported by `#o2` on `v18`. All I need to do is place them at the right pose!  That means I need to arrange these objects at pose `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           Unfortunately, there's a problem.  The allowed actions *only* include `move_base`. There are no `pick` or `place` actions to manipulate the objects.  Without the ability to actually *move* the objects from their current locations, this plan is dead in the water. The goal is simply unreachable with the provided actions.  There's no path to a solution.
