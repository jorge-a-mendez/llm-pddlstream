           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.098, 0.392), (0.19, 0.484)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.166, -0.318), (-0.087, -0.239)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.016, -0.443, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.565, 0.825).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.22, -0.193), (0.292, -0.121)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.144, 0.438, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.546, 0.838).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.127, -0.279, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.657, 0.754).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.256, -0.157, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.697, 0.717).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).

           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Detailed Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the plan I've put together. The goal is to get those four objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) onto surface v18. I'm assuming that the robot base can't move, so all the action happens within reach of the current base configuration, v3.  The main strategy is to pick each object from its initial pose (supported by object v11) and then place it onto v18.  I'll need to make sure I define a unique placement pose on v18 for each object to avoid any collisions.  I'll break it down for each object. The key actions are `pick` and `place` which are within reach, and I need to ensure the poses on surface v18 are valid and safe.
           
           The actions I'll use: `move_base`, `pick`, `place`. The robot's arm is v4.
           
           Here's my plan:
           1.  **Pick** v8 from its initial pose (v9) using the arm (v4).
           2.  **Place** v8 at pose `#o2_v8` on surface v18.
           3.  **Pick** v12 from its initial pose (v13).
           4.  **Place** v12 at pose `#o2_v12` on surface v18.
           5.  **Pick** v14 from its initial pose (v15).
           6.  **Place** v14 at pose `#o2_v14` on surface v18.
           7.  **Pick** v16 from its initial pose (v17).
           8.  **Place** v16 at pose `#o2_v16` on surface v18.
           
           **Important Considerations**:
           
           *   **Continuous Values:** The critical part of this is defining the specific poses (#o2_v8, #o2_v12, etc.) for placement. Since multiple objects are being placed on the same surface, I need to provide *different* continuous values (x, y, z, orientation) for each object at pose `#o2`. I'll specify where each object should be located on v18.  The existing `#o2` symbol is a placeholder.
           *   **Collision Avoidance:** I'll make sure the poses are collision-free.  The plan's goal is to place the objects on `v18`.
           *   **Robot Reachability**: Base is not moving so all the object placements are within the robot's arm reach.
           *   **The Coordinates on v18** are as follows:
           
               *   For v8 I'll use center (-0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0)
               *   For v12 I'll use center (0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0)
               *   For v14 I'll use center (-0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0)
               *   For v16 I'll use center (0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0)
           
           That should do the trick! Now let me confirm.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a planning problem, and the user correctly pointed out a critical flaw in the previous attempt. The core issue is the permissible action: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action doesn't allow for any *interaction* with the objects I need to manipulate. My goal is to get several objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`) onto surface `v18`. That translates to achieving `on(v8 v18)`, `on(v12 v18)`, `on(v14 v18)`, and `on(v16 v18)`.
           
           My initial state tells me these objects are currently on `v11`. To get each object on `v18`, I would need to find a suitable `atpose(object, pose_on_v18)` and `supported(object, pose_on_v18, v18)`.  Fortunately, the initial state gives me `supported` facts that point towards `#o2` as a valid pose on `v18` for each object.
           
           However, here's the kicker: I *only* have the `move_base` action.  This action *only* manipulates the robot's configuration. It doesn't allow me to pick up, move, or place any of the objects. Since I can't modify the `atpose` facts, and the `on` facts directly rely on the `atpose` predicate (via the support relationship), I'm completely stuck. I cannot, with the actions available to me, achieve the desired goal state. The goal is provably unreachable.
