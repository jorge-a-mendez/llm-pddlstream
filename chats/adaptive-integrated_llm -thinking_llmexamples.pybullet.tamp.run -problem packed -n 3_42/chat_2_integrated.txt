           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.295, 0.253), (-0.201, 0.347)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.157, -0.262, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.854, 0.52).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.169, 0.235), (0.242, 0.308)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.248, 0.3, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.851, 0.524).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.205, 0.271, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.022).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.204, -0.309), (-0.11, -0.215)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. The goal is to get objects v8, v12, and v14 onto surface v16 using pick and place actions with the robot's arm v4. Currently, the objects are resting on surface v11, supported by the pose at their base. The arm is at v5, v6 is at v7, and the base is at bconf v3. The base will need to move to a configuration `#o3` to perform the operations.
           
           My first step is to assess the initial situation. I've noted that the initial state describes the objects as `atpose` with respect to their current support, and that they're `supported` by pose v11 (or table v11). The facts will look for poses on v16 (`pose(obj, #o2)`), supported by v16. I can use the existing `kin` facts related to arm v4 for both `pick` and `place`.
           
           The trickiest part is interpreting the `#o2` symbol. Since all objects share this placeholder in the initial *supported* facts but are supported at the pose `#o2`, it means `#o2` refers to a specific *location* on v16 that can hold the poses. I have to interpret this to mean that I need to provide distinct physical locations for each object, despite all being `supported` at the "same" pose symbol. The problem statement gives the rule for this scenario.
           
           I've examined the bounding box (AABB) of v16, which is a square surface. I also consider the dimensions of the objects v8, v12, and v14. To prevent collisions, I will place them in a linear arrangement along the x-axis, centered on the v16 surface and taking into account object size and bounding boxes to ensure the placements are collision-free. I will set y = 0 for all poses. I'll maintain the z-coordinate at 0.781. This is based on all other initial object's poses having z=0.781. I will set theta (rotation) to 0, which is the default in such cases.
           
           The final plan is as follows:
           1.  **Move the base** from configuration v3 to configuration `#o3`.
           2.  **Pick** up object v8 from its current position.
           3.  **Place** v8 at pose `(-0.08575 0.0 0.781 0.0)` on v16.
           4.  **Pick** up object v12 from its current position.
           5.  **Place** v12 at pose `(0.0 0.0 0.781 0.0)` on v16.
           6.  **Pick** up object v14 from its current position.
           7.  **Place** v14 at pose `(0.08575 0.0 0.781 0.0)` on v16.
           
           This plan should successfully move the objects to their target positions while respecting all constraints.
