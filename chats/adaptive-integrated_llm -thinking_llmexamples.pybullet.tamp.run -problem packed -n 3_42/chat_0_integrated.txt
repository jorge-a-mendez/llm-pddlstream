User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.248, 0.3, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.851, 0.524).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.295, 0.253), (-0.201, 0.347)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.205, 0.271, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.022).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.169, 0.235), (0.242, 0.308)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.204, -0.309), (-0.11, -0.215)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.157, -0.262, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.854, 0.52).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom atpose(v14, v15)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom stackable(v14, v10)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom supported(v14, v15, v11)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom stackable(v14, v16)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan that achieves the following goal: `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  This necessitates that objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` be placed on object `v16`. I have a set of initial state facts describing the environment, including the positions of these objects, the arm configurations, and available predicates like `graspable` and `stackable`.  The core challenge lies in the discrepancy between the goal and the available actions.
           
           The initial state reveals that the target objects, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, are currently supported by surface `v11`. To move these to `v16`, I must make use of pick and place actions. The initial setup includes predicates like `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`, demonstrating initial state.
           
           However, a closer inspection of the available actions reveals a critical constraint: the action list only contains `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not impact the predicates that are critical to fulfilling the goal - namely the position and support of the objects. It leaves the objects `atpose` on the wrong surface.
           
           The required preconditions for `pick` and `place` actions that would achieve the goal are not met because the available action list does not contain any of these actions. The key is that the available action list does not include the actions that would be needed. Therefore, the goal is unachievable given the constraints.
