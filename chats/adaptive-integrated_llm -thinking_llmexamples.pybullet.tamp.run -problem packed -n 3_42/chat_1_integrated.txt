User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.295, 0.253), (-0.201, 0.347)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.157, -0.262, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.854, 0.52).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.169, 0.235), (0.242, 0.308)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.248, 0.3, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.851, 0.524).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.205, 0.271, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.022).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.204, -0.309), (-0.11, -0.215)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Placement**
           
           The challenge is to devise a plan to move three objects (v8, v12, and v14) from their current surface (v11) onto a single, smaller surface (v16), using a two-armed robot. The primary objective is to achieve the final state where all three objects are "on" v16. Given my expertise, I've analyzed the problem and here is the strategic breakdown.
           
           My initial thought process began with the 'on' axiom, which necessitates supporting an object at a specific pose. To accomplish this, I must employ a pick-and-place strategy using one of the robot's arms (v4). The task involves picking up each object from its initial position on v11 and subsequently placing it onto the target surface v16 at unique poses.
           
           The provided constraints indicate the robot's base remains stationary (v3), as there are no relevant move_base actions. As a result, the strategy will leverage solely the provided kinematics for arm v4 to execute the desired actions.
           
           My plan involves a simple and effective sequence for each object (v8, v12, v14):
           
           1.  **Pick:** Use arm v4 to pick up the object from its initial pose (e.g., v8 from v9).
           2.  **Place:** Use arm v4 to place the object onto v16 at a newly defined pose.
           
           This sequence will be repeated for each of the three objects. The constraint here is to provide unique continuous values for the `#o2` pose variable on v16 for each object. For the purpose of execution, I have calculated values for these poses using the initial object boundaries and the size of surface v16 to ensure safe, collision-free placements that maximize space utilization, while fulfilling all preconditions for each action.
           
           Specifically, I plan to place v12 in the center of v16, and v8 and v14 on opposite corners.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Plan Impossibility**
           
           Okay, so the user's critique is spot-on. The previous plan failed because it tried to use `pick` and `place`, which aren't in the provided action repertoire. The only action at our disposal is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. Seems pretty useless, frankly!
           
           The goal is to stack three objects, v8, v12, and v14, on top of v16.  We know that initially, these objects are "supported" by v11 and have their own poses. To satisfy the `on` predicate, we need to ensure that each object is *both* `supported` by v16 *and* `atpose` with a pose supported by v16.
           
           The problem? The `move_base` action does nothing useful for object manipulation. It's just a pointless "move" that doesn't actually change anything relevant to object poses or their supports. It’s moving the robot from v3 to v3; it’s redundant!  I can't change the `atpose` of v8, v12, or v14, therefore, I can't achieve the `on` predicates for v16.  The goal is simply unreachable with the given action instance. We need a way to actually *move* and *repose* the objects! This requires an action that allows interactions with the physical world; `move_base` is clearly not it in this case.
