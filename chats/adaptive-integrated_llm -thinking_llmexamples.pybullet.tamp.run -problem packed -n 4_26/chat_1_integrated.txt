User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.054, -0.532), (0.131, -0.454)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.195, 0.021), (0.293, 0.12)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.294, -0.478), (-0.21, -0.395)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.092, -0.493, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.665, 0.746).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.162, -0.376), (0.251, -0.287)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.244, 0.07, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.918, 0.396).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.252, -0.436, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.625).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.207, -0.332, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.987, -0.164).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **The Path to Placement: A Plan for Object Manipulation**
           
           My goal is to place objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto surface `v18`.  The robot has two arms, but only one, `v4`, is relevant.  `v4` is currently empty and located at base configuration `v3`. The robot can't move its base. I need a sequence of *pick* and *place* actions to achieve this goal.
           
           Currently, the objects are resting on `v11`. I'll employ `kin` facts which provide the geometric feasibility for the *pick* and *place* operations. The robot can use `v4` to move the objects to their target positions. Placement will happen using poses denoted by `#o2` on surface `v18`. However, since *different* objects are to be at the *same* `#o2` pose, I'll need *separate* continuous pose values for each object on `v18`. Since the robot's base is fixed, all operations will occur within the base reach.
           
           My plan entails the following, in sequence:
           1.  **Pick `v8` from its current location, `v9`**
           2.  **Place `v8` at position `(-0.07, 0.07, 0.781, 0.0)` on `v18`**.
           3.  **Pick `v12` from its current location, `v13`**
           4.  **Place `v12` at position `(0.07, 0.07, 0.781, 0.0)` on `v18`**.
           5.  **Pick `v14` from its current location, `v15`**.
           6.  **Place `v14` at position `(-0.07, -0.07, 0.781, 0.0)` on `v18`**.
           7.  **Pick `v16` from its current location, `v17`**.
           8.  **Place `v16` at position `(0.07, -0.07, 0.781, 0.0)` on `v18`**.
           
           These placements are safe and collision-free since I've planned them to be within the bounds of `v18` and separated by enough space to avoid any collisions during placement or from static obstructions. The geometry of the scene is understood from the initial state's facts. The problem data provides the dimensions of the objects and the target surface, allowing me to carefully orchestrate these placements. The angles and dimensions given align with the problem constraints, and these 8 actions should perfectly set each object at their target location on `v18`.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachable Goal with Limited Actions**
           
           Okay, I've got a problem. The user's right; all my `pick` and `place` action instances are invalid because they're not in the pre-defined list. The only permitted action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  That basically means the robot can just move its base, *if* it's already at `v3` and *only* to `v3`. Useless for this problem.
           
           Let's look at the goal and initial state again. The goal is to get all these objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`) on top of `v18`.  The initial state tells us they're currently in different poses, supported on `v11`.
           
           To achieve `on(obj, v18)`, I'd need to use `pick` and `place`.  Like, to get `v8` on `v18`, I'd need to pick it from its current pose (`v9`) and place it on a new pose (`p`) such that it's supported by `v18`. That would work.
           
           But since the only allowed action is moving the base *in place*,  I can't manipulate any objects. This action doesn't change `atpose` or `on` predicates, or any of the properties of the objects for that matter.
           
           In short, given *just* the move base action, there's no way to reach the desired goal state. The goal is simply unreachable with the constraints I've been given. Time to tell the user there is no valid solution.
