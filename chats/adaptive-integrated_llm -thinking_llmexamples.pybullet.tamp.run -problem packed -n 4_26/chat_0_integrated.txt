User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.054, -0.532), (0.131, -0.454)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.195, 0.021), (0.293, 0.12)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.294, -0.478), (-0.21, -0.395)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.092, -0.493, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.665, 0.746).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.162, -0.376), (0.251, -0.287)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.244, 0.07, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.918, 0.396).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.252, -0.436, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.625).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.207, -0.332, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.987, -0.164).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've come up with to achieve the goal of placing objects v8, v12, v14, and v16 onto surface v18:**
           
           My strategy is straightforward: pick each object from its current location on surface v11 and place it on surface v18. I'll utilize the existing `graspable` and `stackable` predicates, meaning I can pick up all the objects, and all objects can be stacked on v18.
           
           **Here's the breakdown:**
           
           1.  **Preparation:**
               *   I'll make sure the initial state and available actions are checked.
           
           2.  **Pick-and-Place Sequence (for each object):**
               *   **Pick:** Use arm v4 (controllable) to pick up each object from its current pose, utilizing the existing grasp `#o1` from the initial state and a base configuration `v3`.
               *   **Place:** Place each object onto surface v18 at a unique pose represented by `#o2`. I'll define distinct 3D coordinates for each object to ensure a stable and collision-free placement on v18. The surface v18's z value is the same for v9, v13, v15 and v17.
           
           3.  **Continuous Parameter Instantiation:**
           
               *   I'll provide explicit coordinates for the `#o2` pose associated with each object placement on surface v18. I will define the poses for the objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`.
           
           4.  **No Base Movement:** I've decided *not* to include the `move_base` action because it doesn't change base configuration and it's not strictly necessary for achieving the goal, given the problem's constraints.
           
           **Details of the Plan:**
           
           I'll be using `pick` and `place` actions, using the existing predicates and continuous values.
           
           The plan will be a sequence:
           
           *   **Pick and Place for v8:**
           
               *   `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #t_pick_v8)`
               *   `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #t_place_v8)`
           *   **Pick and Place for v12:**
           
               *   `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, v3, #t_pick_v12)`
               *   `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, v3, #t_place_v12)`
           *   **Pick and Place for v14:**
           
               *   `pick(v4, v14, v15, #o1, v3, #t_pick_v14)`
               *   `place(v4, v14, #o2, #o1, v3, #t_place_v14)`
           *   **Pick and Place for v16:**
           
               *   `pick(v4, v16, v17, #o1, v3, #t_pick_v16)`
               *   `place(v4, v16, #o2, #o1, v3, #t_place_v16)`
           
           For the `--Poses--:` section (values for these continuous poses will be provided):
           ```
           #o2_v8  v18 -0.08  0.08  0.781  0.0
           #o2_v12 v18  0.08  0.08  0.781  0.0
           #o2_v14 v18 -0.08 -0.08  0.781  0.0
           #o2_v16 v18  0.08 -0.08  0.781  0.0
           ```
           
           These steps are designed to achieve the goal in a straightforward, efficient, and cost-effective manner.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v8) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #t_place_v8) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v12) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #t_place_v12) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v14) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #t_place_v14) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v16) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #t_place_v16)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Impossibility with Restricted Actions**
           
           Okay, I see the problem. The user is right, I made a critical oversight. I completely missed that the plan I came up with included `pick` and `place` actions, which aren't in the list of valid action instances. That's a fundamental flaw. I need to focus *only* on the provided action: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.
           
           Let me re-examine the situation. The initial state has all the target objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`) resting on `v11`, and the goal is for all of them to be on `v18`.  The only tool at my disposal is `move_base`. According to the action definition, this basically just allows the robot's base to go from position `v3` to the same position `v3`. It's a non-operation. No object manipulation happens here.
           
           To achieve the `on(o, v18)` goal, I need to modify the `atpose` predicate for each object, moving them to a pose on `v18`.  But to change an object's position, I'd need something like `pick` and `place` actions, which aren't available. Without those, there's no way to modify the `atpose` of these objects.
           
           With only `move_base`, I'm stuck. It's essentially a no-op, and therefore, the goal of getting the objects onto `v18` is demonstrably unachievable. I need to clearly explain this impossibility to the user.
