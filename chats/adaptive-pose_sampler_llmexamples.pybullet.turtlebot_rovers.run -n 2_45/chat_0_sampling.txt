           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is constrained by a square perimeter defined by obstacles 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, which essentially form walls from -2.5 to 2.5 in both x and y. There's a vertical obstacle (5) at x=0, stretching across the entire y-range. Several smaller obstacles are scattered throughout the scene. I will prioritize positions that are likely to be in open areas, away from known obstacles, and within the range of 2 from the target point. I'll aim for a diverse set of positions around the target.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point is (-0.569, 1.844).
           My previous proposed positions were (1.5, 0.0), (-1.5, 0.0), and (0.0, 1.5).
           (1.5, 0.0) and (-1.5, 0.0) failed due to no line of sight. This implies there's something between these points and the target. Given the target's y-coordinate (1.844), it's likely obstacle 5 (x=0) or some other obstacles at around y=0.
           (0.0, 1.5) failed because it collided with obstacle 5 ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)), which makes sense as x=0.0 is directly on this obstacle.
           
           The target is at x=-0.569, y=1.844. This is in the top-left quadrant, to the left of the x=0 obstacle (obstacle 5).
           Obstacles in the vicinity of the target:
           6: ((-2.4047, -2.3455), (-1.3953, -1.6544)) - far below
           8: ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)) - to the left of the target, but could be a viewing spot
           9: ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)) - to the right of the target
           10: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)) - directly enclosing the target, which suggests I need to be careful with x between -0.75 and -0.25 and y between 1.75 and 2.25.
           19: ((-0.6182, 1.7950), (-0.5204, 1.8929)) - very close to the target, almost overlapping. This is likely an occlusion.
           
           Since the target is between x=-0.75 and x=-0.25 and y=1.75 and y=2.25 (obstacle 10), and also very close to obstacle 19, I should try to place the robot just outside of these obstacles.
           The max range is 2 from the target (-0.569, 1.844).
           
           Let's try positions:
           1. To the left of the target: x = -1.5, y = 1.8. This would be within 2 units. Distance = sqrt((-1.5 - (-0.569))^2 + (1.8 - 1.844)^2) = sqrt((-0.931)^2 + (-0.044)^2) = sqrt(0.8667 + 0.0019) = sqrt(0.8686) approx 0.93. This is a good candidate.
           2. Below the target: x = -0.5, y = 0.5. Distance = sqrt((-0.5 - (-0.569))^2 + (0.5 - 1.844)^2) = sqrt(0.069^2 + (-1.344)^2) = sqrt(0.0048 + 1.8063) = sqrt(1.8111) approx 1.34. This is also a good candidate, but it's important to be clear of obstacle 5 (x=0).
           3. Slightly above and to the right of the target, but clear of the obstacles 9 and 10 and 19. Let's try x = 0.1, y = 2.0. Distance = sqrt((0.1 - (-0.569))^2 + (2.0 - 1.844)^2) = sqrt(0.669^2 + 0.156^2) = sqrt(0.4476 + 0.0243) = sqrt(0.4719) approx 0.68. This is also a good candidate.
           
           Positions:
           (-1.5 1.8)
           (-0.5 0.5)
           (0.1 2.0)

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     My previous reasoning for target point (-0.569, 1.844) resulted in valid positions that were then tested. However, the feedback provided in this request is for a new target point: (1.9069, 1.8509). This means the previous failures are associated with the new target point, not the old one. I should use the failures for the *current* target point.
           
           The new target point is (1.9069, 1.8509).
           The failed positions for this target were:
           1. (-1.5, 1.8) - no line of sight. This is far to the left of the target, so it makes sense there's an occlusion, likely obstacle 5 (x=0) or other obstacles in the middle.
           2. (-0.5, 0.5) - no line of sight. Also far to the left and below, so occlusion is expected. Obstacle 5 (x=0) is definitely between this point and the target.
           3. (0.1, 2.0) - collided with obstacles 0 (center box, but this can't be right as the target is 1.9, 1.85, far from center), 1 (top wall, but the specific box for 0 is (( -2.5, -2.5), (2.5, 2.5)), which is the full bounding box of the scene), and 9 ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)). The collision with obstacle 9 is important here. (0.1, 2.0) has x=0.1, which is to the left of obstacle 9. The collision with obstacle 0 is likely an artifact of how the collision check is done for the outer bounds. It's more critical to focus on obstacle 9. The point (0.1, 2.0) is to the left of obstacle 9, so it would indicate that this point is somehow within the AABB of obstacle 0, which is the entire scene. The issue is likely obstacle 9. (0.1, 2.0) is very close to x=0. It may also be colliding with obstacle 5, although it wasn't listed. Obstacle 9 is at (0.25, 1.75) to (0.75, 2.25). My point (0.1, 2.0) is to the left of this.
           
           The target is at (1.9069, 1.8509). This is in the top-right quadrant.
           Obstacles in the vicinity of the target:
           7: ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) - This obstacle is very close to the target, almost enclosing it. The target is inside this obstacle's x-range (1.9069) and y-range (1.8509). This means I need to place the robot *outside* of this specific obstacle.
           13: ((1.4538, 0.8963), (1.5603, 1.0028)) - below and to the left
           14: ((2.1103, -0.9360), (2.2512, -0.7951)) - far below
           18: ((1.1574, 1.1012), (1.2976, 1.2414)) - below and to the left
           20: ((1.8619, 1.8059), (1.9520, 1.8960)) - *This obstacle (20) almost perfectly contains the target point*. The target is (1.9069, 1.8509). Obstacle 20 is at x in [1.8619, 1.9520] and y in [1.8059, 1.8960]. This means the target is *inside* obstacle 20. This is a critical piece of information. The robot cannot be placed where the target is, and it likely cannot see the target through this obstacle.
           
           Given that the target is inside obstacle 20, and obstacle 20 is itself inside obstacle 7, I need to find positions *outside* of these obstacles.
           The max range is 2 from the target (1.9069, 1.8509).
           
           Let's try positions that are *outside* of obstacle 7 and 20:
           1. To the right of the target: x = 2.4, y = 1.8. This is within max_range of 2. Distance = sqrt((2.4 - 1.9069)^2 + (1.8 - 1.8509)^2) = sqrt(0.4931^2 + (-0.0509)^2) = sqrt(0.2431 + 0.0026) = sqrt(0.2457) approx 0.49. This is outside obstacle 7 and 20.
           2. Below the target: x = 1.9, y = 0.5. Distance = sqrt((1.9 - 1.9069)^2 + (0.5 - 1.8509)^2) = sqrt((-0.0069)^2 + (-1.3509)^2) = sqrt(0.000047 + 1.8249) = sqrt(1.825) approx 1.35. This is outside obstacle 7 and 20.
           3. To the left of the target, but clear of obstacle 9 ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)) and obstacle 5 (x=0). Let's try x = 1.0, y = 1.8. Distance = sqrt((1.0 - 1.9069)^2 + (1.8 - 1.8509)^2) = sqrt((-0.9069)^2 + (-0.0509)^2) = sqrt(0.8224 + 0.0026) = sqrt(0.825) approx 0.9. This is outside of obstacle 7 and 20.
           
           Positions:
           (2.4 1.8)
           (1.9 0.5)
           (1.0 1.8)
