(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for a Square Object**
           
           I need to find 50 stable placements for an object with ID 5, and dimensions (0.07, 0.07), on surface 0, which is defined by the points ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)). I need to find the surface index (`surf_idx`), rotation angle (`theta`), and the coordinates of the center (x, y) for each placement. The object must be entirely within the surface boundaries.
           
           I know that the half-dimensions of the object, `half_size_x` and `half_size_y`, are 0.035 each, because it's a square.  Because it's a square object and AABB, rotations don't change this, which simplifies things. The surface limits and this object AABB lead me to calculate valid x and y placement ranges. For surface 0: x must be between 4.235 and 4.765, and y must be between -0.565 and -0.035.
           
           Since the object is a square,  I can create a grid of (x,y) points, with 10 values for x, and 5 values for y. I'll get 50 different points (5 x 10 = 50). I'll also add variety by alternating rotation angles between 0, pi/4, and pi/2 to keep the placements diverse.
           
           Here are the 50 placements:
           (0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565)
           (0, 0.7853981633974483, 4.293888888888889, -0.565)

(Thoughts: **Addressing Placement Stability with Rotated Objects**
           
           Okay, so I've been given feedback on my previous placement attempts, specifically for Object ID 5. The issue was stability failures, and it boiled down to my incorrect handling of object bounding boxes when rotated.  My initial approach wasn't conservative enough.  I was only considering the object's dimensions at 0 and pi/2 radians.
           
           I've learned from this and now realize the critical formula: when an object of size x and size y is rotated, its new axis-aligned bounding box needs to be calculated with these dimensions:
           
           *   `effective_size_x = abs(size_x \* cos(theta)) + abs(size_y \* sin(theta))`
           *   `effective_size_y = abs(size_x \* sin(theta)) + abs(size_y \* cos(theta))`
           
           Specifically, I realize I need to consider `theta = pi/4` to ensure my bounding box is correct in all conditions.
           
           I've revisited Object ID 5 to understand the rotation issue: AABB had to be `0.0989949` x `0.0989949`, and previously I was using `half_size_x = 0.035`, now, I need to use `half_effective_size_x = 0.04949745`.
           
           Now, I'm onto a new placement request, for Object ID 10. The dimensions are nearly square - `0.09746919864103809` x `0.0974691986410377`. This has made me re-think the approach and consider maximum-dimension for any rotation.
           
           For this new object, I'll calculate the maximum AABB dimensions, which occur at a pi/4 rotation, like so:
           Let's consider these dimensions:  `w = 0.09746919864103809`, `h = 0.0974691986410377`
           So, I'll set: `max_obj_half_dim = (0.09746919864103809 + 0.0974691986410377) * 0.70710678118 / 2 = 0.06892006721055775`.
           
           My plan is to use this `max_obj_half_dim` to derive a safe placement region. I'll make sure it can be placed.
           
           Here is the general plan for placing the object ID: 10
           *   `half_dim_robust = 0.06892006721055775`
           *   Define a safe placement region for object center coordinates with x- and y-values between:
               *  Valid x range: `[4.2689200672105575, 4.7310799327894425]`
               *  Valid y range: `[-0.5310799327894422, -0.06892006721055775]`
           *   Generate 50 placements. I'll use 10 x-coordinates and 5 y-coordinates using equal increments.
           *   The options are `theta = 0, theta = pi/4, theta = pi/2`.
           
           So, from now on, I will robustly calculate the AABB for all objects that need to be placed, taking rotation into account!
