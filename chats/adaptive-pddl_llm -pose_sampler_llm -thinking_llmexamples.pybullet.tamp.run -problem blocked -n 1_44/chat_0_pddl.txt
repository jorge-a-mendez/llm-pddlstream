           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 5) -- 0.07000000000000028, 0.06999999999999995)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Here's my thought process:**
           
           I need to generate 50 stable placements for an object on a surface.  The object is a square (0.07 x 0.07), and the surface is a 0.6 x 0.6 square.  "Stable" means the object's fully contained within the surface.  The object can be rotated, which changes its effective bounding box (AABB).
           
           First, I clarified what the given dimensions mean.  I assumed they are the object's intrinsic dimensions. Then I calculated the valid rotation ranges. For a square, rotation doesn't change the area substantially.  The object is significantly smaller than the surface, so I can fit many placements.
           
           I chose a strategy to generate diverse placements. I decided to primarily use a grid-like arrangement with `theta = 0` for 49 out of the 50 placements to cover most of the surface.  I calculated the valid center ranges for `theta=0`. Using these ranges, I made 7 equally spaced points on each axis to cover the area. For the 50th placement, I added variety by using `theta = pi/4` and placing it in the center.
           
           I'm confident the placements I generate will be stable, and the logic is sound because the object's much smaller than the surface and I have checked that the generated locations are valid. I also ensured that the output format matches the one requested in the prompt. I will keep the coordinates precise but also rounded for better readability.
