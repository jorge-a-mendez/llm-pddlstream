           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning through the Plan**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of my thought process in crafting a plan to achieve `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a certain type on `v18`.
           
           1.  **Understanding the Goal:** The ultimate goal is to get an object of a specific type (v17) onto `v18`. I know from the initial state that I have two potential candidates, `v12` and `v8`, both of type `v17`.
           
           2.  **Analyzing the Situation:**  Neither `v12` nor `v8` is currently on `v18`. They are both supported by something different than `v18`. To put an object on `v18`, it needs to be "supported" by `v18` at a particular pose. I see that both `v8` and `v12` could potentially be placed on `v18` according to the *supported* facts in the initial state.
           
           3.  **Choosing an Object and a Strategy:** I decide to focus on getting `v8` on `v18`. I need the robot arm to perform this.  The plan boils down to picking up `v8` and placing it on `v18`.
           
           4.  **Action Selection:** I identify the following actions as relevant: `pick` and `place`. There is also `move_base` to make sure the robot can access the current position.
           
           5.  **Precondition Checking:**  Before executing the `pick` action, I need to ensure its preconditions are met. The robot needs to be at the correct `bconf`, or configuration, to pick `v8`. Then, the robot also needs to be `handempty`. Additionally the `unsafe` predicates need to be negated. To deal with the configuration, I'll need to use `move_base` action beforehand. Then I can perform `pick`.
           
           6.  **Move Base Plan**: I note that the preconditions for `pick v4 v8 v9` can be achieved by first calling `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`. The robot can move to bconf at location `#o3` required to do the `pick` action.
           
           7.  **Completing the Plan:** After successfully picking up `v8`, I'll need to use the `place` action to put `v8` on `v18` at a suitable pose.
           
           8.  **Verification:** After placing `v8`, I should have `atpose(v8, #o2)` and `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. With those facts and the fact that `type(v8, v17)`, the goal axiom should be satisfied, thus achieving the goal.
           
           9. **Alternative Considerations**: I briefly considered moving `v12`, but the plan remains the same. I choose `v8` for consistency.
           
           10. **Plan Consistency**. I check the `canmove()` predicate through the plan steps and note that it is accounted for. The `move_base` negates it while the `pick` and `place` actions establish it again. This completes my plan.
