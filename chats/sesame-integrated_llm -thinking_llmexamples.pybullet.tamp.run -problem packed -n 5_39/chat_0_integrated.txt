           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning the Robot's Task**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get these five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) from where they are on v11 onto v20.  The robot has two arms, but only arm v4 has all the necessary information to pick and place.  I need to use that.  The robot is initially at base configuration v3, and arm configuration v5.  Arm v4 is initially empty.  All the objects are initially *on* v11, and the target is v20.  Crucially, I have kin predicates (kinematic relationships) defined for v4 to pick and place, and the goal state requires the objects to be *on* v20.  This implies I'm placing the objects *on* the surface v20. I will need to define a unique pose on v20 for each object.
           
           The plan will be a sequence of picks and places. First, I have to pick an object, and then place it onto v20, and then I have to do this for all five objects.  The pick action will have the form `pick(v4, obj, initial_pose_obj, grasp, robot_base_config, trajectory)`. The place action is `place(v4, obj, target_pose_obj, grasp, robot_base_config, trajectory)`.  
           
           My initial robot base configuration is v3. To keep things simple and avoid unnecessary base motions, I'll set robot_base_config (#o3) to v3 throughout the plan, as the initial state has `atbconf(v3)`, and the `pick` and `place` actions all need `atbconf(#o3)`.
           
           For each object:
           1.  **Pick:** Use v4 to pick the object from its initial pose.
           2.  **Place:** Use v4 to place the object *on* v20 at a specific target pose.
           
           I will use the `kin` predicates to ensure that pick and place actions are executable. I also have to ensure that the target poses on v20 are valid and won't cause collisions.  Since the initial state *states* that `supported` by v20, I know that v20 is indeed the correct surface to put objects.
           
           The important thing is to *place* them so that they are stable on v20. Given the AABB of the target surface, I need to choose 5 distinct locations for these objects.
           
           I've decided on the poses. I'll place the objects so that they are centered around the center of the surface at `z = 0.781`, and spaced so that they won't collide.
           
           The plan will be the sequence of picks and places, and for each placement, a specific pose must be associated with each object.
           
           **The Detailed Plan**
           
           1.  **Pick** v8 from v9 with v4.
           2.  **Place** v8 *on* v20 (with a specific continuous pose `#o2`).
           3.  **Pick** v12 from v13 with v4.
           4.  **Place** v12 *on* v20 (with a *different* `#o2`).
           5.  **Pick** v14 from v15 with v4.
           6.  **Place** v14 *on* v20 (with a *different* `#o2`).
           7.  **Pick** v16 from v17 with v4.
           8.  **Place** v16 *on* v20 (with a *different* `#o2`).
           9.  **Pick** v18 from v19 with v4.
           10. **Place** v18 *on* v20 (with a *different* `#o2`).
           
           Cost will be 10 (1 for each pick and place).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Rethinking the Strategy: Navigating Continuous Parameters**
           
           I've been instructed that my previous plan contained invalid actions, specifically due to incorrect handling of continuous parameters. My original approach of directly substituting variables for these parameters, like replacing `#o3` with `v3`, was a fundamental misunderstanding. Instead, I need to treat continuous parameters as values that need to be *computed* by the planner, not simply replaced with existing ones.
           
           The key insight lies in the `kin` predicate, which links base configurations (like `#o3`) to the robot's kinematics. The initial state includes `kin(v4, v16, v17, #o1, #o3, #o4)`, where `#o3` is clearly a base configuration that must be calculated, not a direct substitute for an existing variable like `v3`. The `move_base` action is now critical. To perform pick and place actions, the robot must be at the base configuration `#o3`. Therefore, I need a `move_base` action to reposition the robot from its current base, `v3`, to the calculated `#o3`.
           
           Based on the available actions, the first step must be `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`. This will be the foundational movement. The plan will then consist of a series of pick-and-place actions for each object, using the appropriate continuous pose for each placement and the correct base configuration, `#o3`. I've re-verified the objects to be moved, their initial poses, and the target surface, `v20`. The poses for placement on `v20` must also be unique and collision-free. I'll maintain the previously calculated values as they are.
           
           The detailed plan:
           
           1.  Move base from `v3` to `#o3`.
           2.  Pick object `v8` from `v9`.
           3.  Place object `v8` at `#o2` on `v20`.
           4.  Pick object `v12` from `v13`.
           5.  Place object `v12` at `#o2` on `v20`.
           6.  Pick object `v14` from `v15`.
           7.  Place object `v14` at `#o2` on `v20`.
           8.  Pick object `v16` from `v17`.
           9.  Place object `v16` at `#o2` on `v20`.
           10. Pick object `v18` from `v19`.
           11. Place object `v18` at `#o2` on `v20`.
           
           The plan utilizes the provided actions precisely, ensuring that all continuous parameters are correctly handled and that the robot moves between the correct base configurations as dictated by the kinematics. This should meet the goal of placing the specified objects on the target surface, within the given constraints. The poses are now checked again to be within the required bounds. The plan should also satisfy all preconditions. I'll now submit this as my revised strategy, considering the use of *computed* continuous parameters.
