           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is largely enclosed by a rectangular boundary from (-2.5, -2.5) to (2.5, 2.5). There's a central vertical wall at x=0. Many smaller obstacles are scattered throughout the scene. My strategy is to select positions in a circle around the target point with radius 1.5, to ensure they are within the max_range of 2. I'll pick positions that are not directly behind any known obstacles from the target's perspective. I will also try to vary the angle around the target to get a diverse set of positions.

           (-1.08 0.54)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The previous attempts failed due to the central wall and other smaller obstacles, primarily blocking line of sight. The target point is in the upper left quadrant. I will focus on positions in the upper left region, specifically to the right or below the target, to avoid obstacles between the robot and target. I'll maintain a distance from the target of about 1.5 units, so the new points are not occluded by the same obstacles as the previous points. I also need to be careful to avoid the vertical wall at x=0.

Model:     The new target point is at (1.86, 1.95), which is in the upper right quadrant. My previous attempts were trying to reach the old target which was in the upper left, so the previous failures are good lessons for that area, but I will need to adjust for the new target. The new target is quite close to obstacle 7 ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)), so I need to be careful not to place the robot within it or have it occluded by it. The central wall at x=0 is still a major obstacle. I will try to place the robot to the left, below, or to the right of the target, avoiding the known obstacles and the central wall.
