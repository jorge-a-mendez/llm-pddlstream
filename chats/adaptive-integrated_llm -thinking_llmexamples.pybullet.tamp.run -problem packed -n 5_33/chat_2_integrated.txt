           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.217, 0.222), (-0.125, 0.314)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.239, -0.505), (-0.154, -0.42)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.019, -0.346), (0.079, -0.249)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.004, 0.229), (0.101, 0.326)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.171, 0.268, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.209, 0.978).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.021, 0.427), (0.12, 0.525)).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.197, -0.463, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.61, 0.792).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.03, -0.298, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.884, 0.468).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.052, 0.278, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.281, 0.96).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.071, 0.476, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.438, 0.899).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm dealing with. The task is to get five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) currently on surface v11, onto surface v20. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, currently with both hands empty. The objects are initially at specific poses (v9, v13, etc.) and v20 is defined as an AABB. My first thought is to list the states: atpose, handempty, and supported on. Based on the domain rules, I can use move_base, pick, and place actions. The issue is these items have small dimensions and must fit collision-free on surface v20.
           
           **Action Planning and Goal Decomposition**
           
           The general idea is move base, then pick and place for each item. Specifically: move the robot base to a pre-defined base location; pick the object with the active arm and a pre-defined grasp; place the object at the new pose on the surface. All these steps are straightforward.
           
           **Geometry and Feasibility Check**
           
           The challenge is the "collision-free stable placement". The area of v20 is 0.27m x 0.27m. The objects have AABBs, roughly 0.1m x 0.1m, so in order to be collision free on surface v20, all object bounds must stay within the given bounds, and they must not overlap. So, the question is whether these items can be packed in a way that is compliant with space and collision requirements.
           
           **Spatial Analysis and Limitations**
           
           Here's where it gets tricky. I've broken down the steps and started looking at the geometry, using the AABB coordinates for the target poses. I found that I need to place objects within the provided space -0.135 and +0.135 meters on the two axes. I had several potential placements; however, no matter the arrangement, even a very close packing arrangement that would create an “L” shape - 2 items down the top and 2 down the left, then one in the center - was not viable. Given an object's width or height of, let's say, approximately 0.1m for each of the five items, it is not possible to position all five items within a 27cm x 27cm surface. I have verified that you cannot fit 5 objects and be in the "within limits" conditions.
           
           **Conclusion and Strategy**
           
           The spatial constraints presented do not allow for the desired number of objects given the dimensions. The goals will not be met in the manner provided. As there is no stacking, and no other space for items, the only rational conclusion is that there is no solution to the problem as is.
