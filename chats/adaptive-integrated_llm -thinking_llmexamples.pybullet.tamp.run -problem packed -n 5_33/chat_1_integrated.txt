User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.217, 0.222), (-0.125, 0.314)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.239, -0.505), (-0.154, -0.42)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.019, -0.346), (0.079, -0.249)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.004, 0.229), (0.101, 0.326)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.171, 0.268, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.209, 0.978).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.021, 0.427), (0.12, 0.525)).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.197, -0.463, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.61, 0.792).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.03, -0.298, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.884, 0.468).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.052, 0.278, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.281, 0.96).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.071, 0.476, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.438, 0.899).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Summary of my plan:**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've got a bunch of objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) currently located on a surface v11, and my goal is to place them onto the v20 surface.  The robot arm available is v4, and its initial base configuration is v3. I've got to use a series of 'pick' and 'place' actions for this.
           
           Because all the "kin" predicates use  "#o3" for the base configuration and "#o4" for the arm trajectory, and because the initial state shows "atbconf(v3)" and "ataconf(v4, v5)", it is clear that everything needs to be performed from base configuration "v3". The only available `move_base` action doesn't change the base configuration so all 'pick' and 'place' actions need to be feasible from that base.
           
           Now, let's break down the object placement. I'm going to determine a continuous value to represent the pose when the object is on v20.
           
           For each object, I'll perform these steps:
           1.  **Pick:** (Using the initial pose)
           2.  **Place:** (Targeting the v20 surface)
           
           My strategy is to place the objects in a row on the v20 surface so that they don't collide with each other and are fully contained. Here's a summary of the individual actions:
           
           *   **v8:** Pick from v9, place at `#o2_v8_v20`
           *   **v12:** Pick from v13, place at `#o2_v12_v20`
           *   **v14:** Pick from v15, place at `#o2_v14_v20`
           *   **v16:** Pick from v17, place at `#o2_v16_v20`
           *   **v18:** Pick from v19, place at `#o2_v18_v20`
           
           All 'pick' and 'place' actions use the same base and arm trajectory, which are fixed by the initial conditions.
           
           I've made sure that the x and y coordinates of the objects are within the bounds of the v20 surface to ensure they all fit. The height of placement on v20 is decided as a standard value that is equal to the object height + v20. The final plan's total cost is therefore 10, minimum since pick and place operations have a cost of 1.
           
           The continuous values will be placed as follows:
           v8: x=-0.08, y=-0.08, z=0.781, theta=0
           v12: x=0.08, y=-0.08, z=0.781, theta=0
           v14: x=-0.08, y=0.08, z=0.781, theta=0
           v16: x=0.08, y=0.08, z=0.781, theta=0
           v18: x=0, y=0, z=0.781, theta=0

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v18 v19 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v18 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, I see the problem. The user is correct; the previous plan included actions outside the permissible set. The only action allowed is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  
           
           My objective is to have all five objects - specifically, those designated as `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` - placed *on* surface `v20`. That's the conjunction of the `on` predicates that defines my goal.
           
           Currently, based on the initial state and the `supported` predicates, each object is *on* surface `v11`.  This is because the `atpose` predicates, combined with the `supported` relation, logically imply that the objects are currently resting on `v11`.
           
           To accomplish the goal, these objects need to be moved from `v11` to `v20`.  My expertise tells me that this necessitates a sequence of `pick` and `place` actions; those are the core primitives for manipulating objects in this kind of scenario.
           
           However, the allowed actions are severely limited.  `move_base` is the *only* action I can use. This means I'm effectively stuck. I can't pick up or place any objects. Given that I have no mechanism to move the objects, and the problem is one of moving them to a target, I must conclude that the goal is currently *unreachable* with these constraints. It is impossible to achieve my goal using only the provided, restricted action instance.
