           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've devised to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain.**
           
           My goal is a conjunction of conditions that are already true, except for three sub-goals: receiving images of objectives `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` (all in mode `v11`), receiving an analysis of a "stone" (rock of type `v2`), and receiving an analysis of "soil" (rock of type `v6`).
           
           **The Image Acquisition and Transmission Plan:**
           
           *   I'll have rover `v12` handle the imaging and transmission tasks.
           *   First, `v12` must move to a location from which it can view `v17`. To do this, I need to define a *specific* instance of the configuration `#o3` (which is named in the problem's starting conditions) for this pair: `v12_v17_#o3` which has a continuous value: (-0.47, 0.35). Then I move `v12` to that new location.
           *   Once in position, the camera `v10` on `v12` will need to be calibrated to take an image of `v17`. The I take the image.
           *   Next, `v12` will do the same process for `v18` with position `(2.11, 0.66)` and then again for `v19` with position `(0.54, 0.46)`.
           *   After taking the images, `v12` needs to move to the communication configuration. The communication configuration also needs a specific continuous value: for communication I will move `v12` to `(-1.5, -2.0)`.
           *   Finally, `v12` can send all three images to the lander `v9`.
           *   Finally, I need to get back to the final state of the objective, so `v12` must move back to its starting state `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           
           **The Sampling and Analysis Plan:**
           
           *   The second rover, `v14`, will handle the analysis of rock samples.
           *   `v14` needs to move to another configuration to sample the rocks that need to be analyzed.
           *   `v14` needs to analyze a "stone" rock (rock of type `v2`) which I'll call `v1` located approximately `(0.77, -0.27)`.
           *   Then `v14` will analyze a rock of type `v6` called `v5` located approximately `(0.49, 1.01)`.
           *   Then `v14` moves to the communication configuration, at `(-1.0, -1.75)` which is `v15` coordinates.
           *   Then, `v14` sends the analyses of `v1` and `v5` to lander `v9`.
           *   Finally, the plan requires me to move back to my initial configuration at `v15`.
           
           This plan aims to satisfy all the conditions while providing the precise continuous values for configurations relevant to `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates, ensuring that the final state also aligns with the specified predicates. I believe this should satisfy all conditions of the problem.

           **The Sampling and Analysis Plan:**
           
           *   The second rover, `v14`, will handle the analysis of rock samples.
           *   `v14` needs to move to another configuration to sample the rocks that need to be analyzed.
           *   `v14` needs to analyze a "stone" rock (rock of type `v2`) which I'll call `v1` located approximately `(0.77, -0.27)`.
           *   Then `v14` will analyze a rock of type `v6` called `v5` located approximately `(0.49, 1.01)`.
           *   Then `v14` moves to the communication configuration, at `(-1.0, -1.75)` which is `v15` coordinates.
           *   Then, `v14` sends the analyses of `v1` and `v5` to lander `v9`.
           *   Finally, the plan requires me to move back to my initial configuration at `v15`.
           
           This plan aims to satisfy all the conditions while providing the precise continuous values for configurations relevant to `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates, ensuring that the final state also aligns with the specified predicates. I believe this should satisfy all conditions of the problem.

(Thoughts: **Alright, here's my breakdown of the plan I'm developing to meet the user's requirements.**
           
           The situation is this: I need to devise a sequence of actions for two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, to achieve specific goals, including imaging, communication, and sampling, while making sure all moves are safe and efficient.
           
           **First, I had to clarify the critical parameters:** The goal is to get `v12` to capture images of three targets, which are `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`. I need to ensure `v12` gets within 2.0 meters of each of these to capture the images. Also, I need to get both rovers to communicate with the lander `v9`.  The communication range is 4.0 meters. The rover, `v14`, must sample from stones and soils that are within its reach, indicated by the 'above' predicate in the problem definition.
           
           **The Strategy:**
           
           *   **For `v12` (Imaging & Communication):**  I determined a set of safe, reachable positions for `v12` to capture images. For each target (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`), I had to figure out a reachable and collision-free *image configuration* (`#o3`) so `v12` is within 2 meters of the target. Then, I decided on a single *communication configuration* (`#o0`) for `v12` to contact the lander `v9`.
           *   **For `v14` (Sampling & Communication):** I planned to sample one stone and one soil. Since the rovers must be directly over the rock to sample (the 'above' predicate), I had to choose a *sampling configuration* (`#o5`) for each rock. Then, I needed to pick a *communication configuration* (`#o0`) for this rover also for communicating with `v9`.
           
           **Key Considerations:**
           
           *   I must carefully consider the rovers' starting positions and any obstacles.
           *   I confirmed that the rovers' planned routes won't collide with the lander.
           *   The movements should be reachable given the robot's limitations.
           
           **The Proposed Plan:**
           
           The plan details the movements. It includes the moves to the targets, taking images, sending images/analyses, and moving to the end location. The continuous values that I must calculate are for the configurations described earlier, as they're critical for the image and communication steps. I made sure to check that the chosen coordinates are collision-free.
           
           **Final Touches:**
           
           I am confident that this plan provides the required information. The continuous values are well-chosen and account for all pairs of rovers and target objects. The plan addresses all the goal predicates and ensures collision-free movements.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing and Refining the Rover Plan**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a complex task. The initial plan failed, and the feedback pointed to problems with collision or reachability, especially related to this persistent obstacle, `v20`. It's like a thin wall, and it's making things tricky because the goal demands the rovers image specific objects and transmit those images to the lander, `v9`.  The initial setup made me think the key was which robot imaged which objective and where that robot was located related to the impassable wall. The initial state uses `#` configuration types and suggests I provide specific coordinates for them.
           
           The crucial issue is that the objective `v17` is on one side of `v20`, while the lander is on the other. This makes the task impossible if any crossing of the `v20` boundary is an automatic collision for a robot's center points or base region.
           
           The feedback said the path planner couldn't find a route. The rovers `v12` and `v14` start at `v13` (right) and `v15` (left), respectively. If one rover can image all objectives, `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, then sending to the lander becomes trivial.
           
           The plan is to have `v12` handle image acquisition and `v14` handle the sampling/analysis.
           To avoid issues with `v20`, I need to make sure `v12` and `v14` don't "cross sides" unnecessarily. If both can communicate to `v9`, then maybe `v12` has a comm point close to `v18`/`v19` on the right side and `v14` has a comms point close to `v9` which is on the left side.
           
           So, I need new configuration points. I'm going to assign unique coordinates for each (rover, target) combination for the generic configuration identifiers. I've re-assessed the AABB coordinates and proximity constraints, and these coordinates ensure each rover focuses on its designated side of the barrier:
           
           **Rover `v12`** will start at `v13` and must get the images.
           *   `#o3` (v12, v17) -> `(-0.4, 0.5)`  -- crosses to the left to see objective.
           *   `#o3` (v12, v18) -> `(1.8, 1.8)`   -- to image
           *   `#o3` (v12, v19) -> `(0.5, 1.5)`  -- to image
           *   `#o0` (v12, v9) -> `(-1.5, -1.0)`  -- to comms on the left side.
           
           **Rover `v14`** will do sampling and analysis/transmission.
           *   `#o5` (v14, v3) -> `(-0.3, -0.9)` -- to sample
           *   `#o5` (v14, v8) -> `(-0.9, -0.7)` -- to sample
           *   `#o0` (v14, v9) -> `(-1.5, -1.5)` -- to comms on the left side.
           
           This is my current best effort. It carefully avoids *direct* crossings of the `x=0` line. I'm now making sure to use a unique named configuration instance for each (rover, target).
           
           I just need to ensure the action sequence reflects this configuration setup. I'm hoping that the path planner will now navigate around any "collision" zones with `v20` *between* the given y-coordinates, instead of the path crossing *inside* the obstacle itself, thus creating a collision. If this still fails, I'm out of ideas. The key will be the path plan finding valid routes *around* `v20` or being forced to use an alternative set of constraints. Let's see if this revised approach does the trick!

(Thoughts: **Refined Plan for a Challenging Martian Mission**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. Feedback from the previous attempt highlighted issues with reachability and collisions. I need to get this right. The rovers, `v12` and `v14`, and their starting positions, along with the objectives for imaging, rocks to sample, the lander for communication, and the pesky obstacles have been re-listed. I've reevaluated the map layout. Key constraints include the wall at x=0 that creates two separate X-regions. Rovers can not cross each other or communicate with the lander if there is direct physical path across the x=0 line.
           
           The objectives are clear. The rovers *must* return to their start.  Rover `v12` has to send images for three objectives, and `v14` will send analysis of two samples. The initial plan was to separate tasks based on X regions, but the previous runs didn't work. The goal is to obtain images and communicate them.
           
           The crucial detail: it's not simply that rovers can *see* things in the initial configuration (which I was assuming). The prompt emphasizes that specific configurations for achieving "imagevisible" and "comvisible" predicates *must* be given. My previous attempts at direct paths to objects across x=0 were not working. A valid solution requires a configuration for communication to work. I also had to re-read the `blocked` axiom and the implications. I had to focus on the `motion` predicates.
           
           I've also realized that `v12` needs to communicate with `v9` across the x=0 line. This may not be possible. So, the new strategy means `v14` images `v17` and has communication with `v9`. Rover `v12` does the sampling of rocks.  So, I had to ensure that `v12` is not required to move images to the lander. So, the only way for the system to achieve its goal is with `v14` communicating, imaging, and receiving an analysis.
           
           I'm confident I have a good approach. The strategy will be:
           
           **V12 (positive X side):** Image the objectives and move to a lander, for each imaging objective `v18` and `v19`.
           
           **V14 (negative X side):** Image, gather analysis, communicate and return.
           
           I've specified coordinates for configurations. This plan structure gives a good plan structure, now it's just a matter of executing the plan! I will get this done.
