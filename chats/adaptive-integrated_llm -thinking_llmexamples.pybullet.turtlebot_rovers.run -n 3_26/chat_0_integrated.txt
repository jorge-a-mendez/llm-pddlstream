           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Analysis and Planning for `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` Domain**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with generating a plan to achieve the `new-axiom@0()` goal in the rovers domain. This involves a conjunction of predicates: being at a specific configuration, having images from certain objects, and receiving analyses for specific types of rocks.
           
           Let's break it down. I need to ensure rovers `v12` and `v14` are in their initial states, which they are.  Then, I need to get images of three specific objects, `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`, and have those images received. Finally, I need to receive an analysis of a rock of type `v2` and a rock of type `v6`.
           
           Initially, both rovers are in configurations that meet the `atconf` and `free` predicates. However, the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates are all initially false. This means I'll have to take action to make them true.
           
           I have to carefully use the available actions to achieve these. I know I'll have to use `move`, `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`, and `drop_rock`. I have to also make sure I don't break the initial state.
           
           The key is to leverage the rovers' current configurations and the initial `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates, along with the available stores and rocks. My strategy is to take pictures of the objectives, analyze two distinct rock types, and send the results to satisfy the condition.
           
           Here's my plan:
           
           1.  **Image Acquisition:** I will use rover `v14` to capture and send images for `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`, using the available camera and mode. The current configuration is `#o3`.
               *   The problem is about specifying poses and configurations with coordinates.
           2.  **Rock Analysis:** Rover `v14` will sample and analyze rock `v1` (type `v2`), then send the analysis. Rover `v12` will do the same with rock `v8` (type `v6`).
               *   The key here is that I cannot move the rovers based on the specified actions. This means that I *have* to assume that the configuration objects `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5` refer to the current configuration of the rovers (`v13`, and `v15`).
           3.  **Clean Up:** Finally, I must also ensure that the initial condition for `free` stores is also met so I will need to drop the rocks at the end of the operation.
           
           Since there are no movement actions specified that permit the rover to change poses, and the goal requires specific configurations, I will need to use each of the target configurations as their current ones. Then, the problem of supplying geometric information to satisfy the preconditions becomes moot; by PDDL definition of the setup, all the preconditions must already be met, regardless of the relative positions, given the limited allowed actions.
           
           Regarding those "#" parameters: In this specific problem, I am to treat the given configuration as the base and ignore the fact that the geometry does not support that, as it violates the conditions the problem imposes. This also lets me skip considering the `motion`, `calibrate`, `take_image`, and `send_image` actions as no-ops for this plan.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10) , (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11) , (send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11) , (calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10) , (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11) , (send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11) , (calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v19 v10) , (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v19 v10 v11) , (send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v19 v11) , (sample_rock v14 #o5 v1 v16) , (send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v1) , (sample_rock v12 #o5 v8 v16) , (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v8)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a very limited set of actions I'm allowed to use. It seems my previous attempts were way off base, using actions like `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, and `sample_rock`. Now, I *only* have these: `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))`, `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`, `((drop_rock v12 v16))`, and `((drop_rock v14 v16))`.
           
           My goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which, as you know, is a conjunction of several conditions. Some of them are initially true (`atconf` and `free` predicates), but the crucial ones I need to worry about are the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. I need to get images and analyses.
           
           Here's the problem: *only* the `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions can set those predicates to true.  And, surprise, *neither* of those actions is on my list of allowed actions!
           
           Worse, the `drop_rock` actions have preconditions that cannot be initially satisfied. They require `full`, but I *start* with `free`.  The `move` actions are even worse because they are no-ops given the initial state.
           
           Therefore, because I cannot use the only actions that can establish the required `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` conditions (and because the `drop_rock` actions cannot be executed given the initial state), I'm forced to conclude that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is simply *unreachable* with the given action set.  It's a dead end, given the constraints.
