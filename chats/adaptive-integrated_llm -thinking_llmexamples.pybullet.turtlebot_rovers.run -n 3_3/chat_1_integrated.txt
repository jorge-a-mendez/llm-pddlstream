           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Breakdown for Achieving `new-axiom@0()` Goal**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to tackle this. The objective is `new-axiom@0()`, which I've deconstructed into several key sub-goals: ensuring both rovers are at their starting configurations, acquiring images of three objectives, getting analyses of a stone and soil, and keeping storage free. I can leverage the initial state to get to this:
           
           First off, I see `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are true, so rovers start at specific positions. The goal requires these to be true at the final state as well, so I'll need to account for rover movement. I'll need to verify if the configurations were preserved.
           
           I've got both `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`, which means the store, v16, is empty on both rovers. This condition is required to be true at the final state, so this needs careful handling, and a dropping step will be required during the sampling step.
           
           Now, I'm facing the challenge of ensuring `receivedimage` predicates for all three objectives (v17, v18, v19) and `receivedanalysis` predicates for at least one stone and one soil. The action `send_image` and `send_analysis` are involved.
           
           To receive images, I need to use the action `send_image` which requires the `haveimage` predicate. I can acquire `haveimage` by `take_image` which also requires `atconf` and `calibrated`, so, I will need to use `move` action to get the rovers in the right position before calibration and taking images using camera `v10`. For achieving `receivedanalysis` predicates, I'll need to be above rocks.
           
           The initial `imagevisible` predicates show `v12` and `v14` can see all objectives at a particular point (`#o3`), and can use rays (`#o4`). Also, `comvisible` to lander is provided from `#o0` with ray `#o1`.
           The `above` for rocks is initially true for `v14` from configuration `#o5`. I will just consider all information that can be obtained from the initial state, to use existing information. The plan assumes rays are not blocked unless specified.
           
           Since the problem is about ensuring some goal at a final state, I will need to ensure the final state satisfies it with any rover. I will assume `v14` handles everything and comes back to its original configuration `v15` at the end. I will use `v14` as the primary rover.
           
           I plan to focus on these actions for rover `v14`:
           1.  **Move to `#o3` and Image objectives:** Move `v14` to a new configuration `#o3` and calibrate/take images of all objectives.
           2.  **Move to `#o5` and sample rocks:** Move `v14` to `#o5` which allows sampling rocks. `free` store will be a problem so rock must be dropped before taking more samples.
           3.  **Move to `#o0` and transmit:** Move `v14` to `#o0`, send the images and the analyses to the lander using the `send_` actions.
           4.  **Return:** Move `v14` back to `v15`.
           
           The configurations are described by coordinates. I need to define the positions for the configurations `#o3`, `#o5` and `#o0`. They appear in the initial state so I need to specify their locations. Also, I need to define the coordinates of these configurations. I am constrained by the definition. The positions of the objectives, stone and soil are given, so the configuration is set such that it allows the rover to reach these.
           
           Finally, because there is no explicit information to determine blockage and the path, I need to verify, that path must be clear to travel. So I need to set the location for all these three locations with respect to v14.
           
           After going over this, I'm confident my plan aligns with the problem constraints. I will send the positions, and the initial configurations are met, as well as the goal state.

           Now, I'm facing the challenge of ensuring `receivedimage` predicates for all three objectives (v17, v18, v19) and `receivedanalysis` predicates for at least one stone and one soil. The action `send_image` and `send_analysis` are involved.
           
           To receive images, I need to use the action `send_image` which requires the `haveimage` predicate. I can acquire `haveimage` by `take_image` which also requires `atconf` and `calibrated`, so, I will need to use `move` action to get the rovers in the right position before calibration and taking images using camera `v10`. For achieving `receivedanalysis` predicates, I'll need to be above rocks.
           
           The initial `imagevisible` predicates show `v12` and `v14` can see all objectives at a particular point (`#o3`), and can use rays (`#o4`). Also, `comvisible` to lander is provided from `#o0` with ray `#o1`.
           The `above` for rocks is initially true for `v14` from configuration `#o5`. I will just consider all information that can be obtained from the initial state, to use existing information. The plan assumes rays are not blocked unless specified.
           
           Since the problem is about ensuring some goal at a final state, I will need to ensure the final state satisfies it with any rover. I will assume `v14` handles everything and comes back to its original configuration `v15` at the end. I will use `v14` as the primary rover.
           
           I plan to focus on these actions for rover `v14`:
           1.  **Move to `#o3` and Image objectives:** Move `v14` to a new configuration `#o3` and calibrate/take images of all objectives.
           2.  **Move to `#o5` and sample rocks:** Move `v14` to `#o5` which allows sampling rocks. `free` store will be a problem so rock must be dropped before taking more samples.
           3.  **Move to `#o0` and transmit:** Move `v14` to `#o0`, send the images and the analyses to the lander using the `send_` actions.
           4.  **Return:** Move `v14` back to `v15`.
           
           The configurations are described by coordinates. I need to define the positions for the configurations `#o3`, `#o5` and `#o0`. They appear in the initial state so I need to specify their locations. Also, I need to define the coordinates of these configurations. I am constrained by the definition. The positions of the objectives, stone and soil are given, so the configuration is set such that it allows the rover to reach these.
           
           Finally, because there is no explicit information to determine blockage and the path, I need to verify, that path must be clear to travel. So I need to set the location for all these three locations with respect to v14.
           
           After going over this, I'm confident my plan aligns with the problem constraints. I will send the positions, and the initial configurations are met, as well as the goal state.

(Thoughts: **Navigating a Complex Mission**
           
           Okay, so the original plan failed. We had the rover `v14` at a configuration `#o3` that was in a collision, and we need to fix it. My goal here is to find new, collision-free configurations for the rover to take images of the objectives and then get the samples.
           
           The tricky part is that the objectives are scattered, and one of them is also an obstacle, *v19*.  This means I must avoid v19 and another obstacle, *v20*.  The original plan used the same configuration for all image targets, which is why it collided. And since the problem requires a *single* variable for image, I have to find a way to make the plan work within that constraint. So the first thing I did was to write down all of the locations and obstacles with AABBs, since that is all I have to go on.
           
           My first thought was to go for the most straightforward approach and try to use a single `#o3` for all images. After looking at the target locations, however, it's clear that it's impossible for `v14` to image `v17, v18, v19` from a single point without hitting those obstacles.  The objectives are too far apart (the distance between two of them exceeds the max imaging range), and I can't just pick a point between them since `v19` is both an objective and an obstacle.
           
           The geometry just doesn't work out. It's actually impossible. The target, obstacles and rover's range just don't have enough room. That's when I realized the problem statement suggests using a *distinct* configuration `#o3` for each target. Since the code does not provide the planner, I have to work with what I have and get it as good as possible.
           
           To do this, I needed to define several `#o3` locations, each suitable for a specific image, but with distinct `X` and `Y` for each target to solve the geometric problem. To make everything work together, this has to be a low-level problem and the planner would have to handle the fine-tuning.
           
           Here's how I think it will work out:
           
           *   **Move to `#o3` for *v17* image.** (`x=1.0, y=2.0`) - Outside the collision zone, within range of the target.
           *   **Image *v17*.**
           *   **Move to `#o3` for *v18* image.** (`x=-1.5, y=2.15`) - A point that won't collide with anything, and it's within range.
           *   **Image *v18*.**
           *   **Move to `#o3` for *v19* image.** (`x=0.0, y=2.2`) - This is outside of the obstacle.
           *   **Image *v19*.**
           *   **Move to `#o5` for sampling.** (`x=-0.4, y=0.0`) - Above the resources.
           *   **Sample stones/soil, and drop them in the store.**
           *   **Move to `#o0` for sending.** (`x=-1.5, y=-1.9`) - This will be for getting the message out.
           *   **Send images and analysis.**
           *   **Drop rocks and go back to original configuration.**
           
           These points are carefully selected to avoid collisions with the bounding boxes of `v19` and `v20`.  The rover *should* be able to image everything and the coordinates I have given should avoid any collisions. The *above* predicates should resolve with the sample, in the plan, once coordinates are assigned.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating Configurations for Rover Action**
           
           I've been given feedback that previous configurations I proposed were problematic, either causing collisions or being unreachable. I need to revisit the continuous values for positioning rover `v14` to ensure I'm getting the rover into viable configurations. My core goal remains the same: execute `new-axiom@0()`, which relies on `atconf`, `free`, `receivedimage`, and `receivedanalysis` predicates regarding the rock and soil samples, as well as an unobstructed view for communication.  Rover `v12` is staying put at `v13`. I'll use rover `v14` for all operations.
           
           I'm starting by re-examining the target objects and obstacles, particularly their bounding boxes (AABBs). Rover `v14` has an AABB of `((-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571))` and is currently at an initial config `v15` of `(-1.0, -1.75)`.  I'll then determine my configurations for communication, imaging, and sampling.
           
           1.  **Communication (`#o0`):** I previously proposed  `(-1.5, -1.9)` but was informed it would collide with the lander `v9`, which has an AABB of `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.  I've recalculated and determined that the rover is currently NOT in collision. This means the feedback was correct; the proposed configuration had a collision with the Lander `v9`, given that `(-1.5, -1.9)` would have overlapped the lander's bounding box and communication range is at most 4 units.  A safer approach is to set `#o0` outside the lander's bounding box to ensure it's in a good position for communication. Considering that communication is important, it needs to be near `v9`. I've chosen `(-1.0, -1.5)`. The distance between the rover's initial position and the lander `v9` is well under the 4 unit `comvisible` requirement.
           
           2.  **Imaging (`#o3`):**  I need to position rover `v14` close enough to objectives `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` to take images within the `imagerange` of 2 units, while avoiding obstacles `v20` and the vertical strip `v21`. The position is as follows:
               *   **For `v17`**: I propose `(1.5, 2.0)`. Distance is under 2 units. I've rechecked for collisions and confirmed it won't impact `v20` or `v21`
               *   **For `v18`**: I propose `(-0.7, 2.15)`. Distance to `v18` center: 0.2 units. No collisions!
               *   **For `v19`**: I initially proposed `(0.0, 2.2)`, but this would collide with obstacle `v21`.  I've adjusted the location to `(1.0, 2.2)`, which avoids collisions and meets the 2-unit imaging requirement.
           
           3.  **Sampling (`#o5`):** I need to position the rover above the rock and soil samples, `v4` and `v8`, respectively, without causing a collision.  I calculated the midpoint between the rocks, resulting in `(-0.4, 0.1)`.   This location is collision-free and, hopefully, provides a single configuration. Even though a strictly literal interpretation of bounding boxes shows the rover might not be "above" in the strictest geometric sense, the initial state includes `above` predicates.  Therefore, I'll assume this plan can determine the correct sample site. This coordinate is also reachable from initial state.
           
           With all configurations verified, here's my updated plan.
           
           *   Move from `v15` to `(1.5, 2.0)` (`#o3` location for `v17`).
           *   Take image of `v17`.
           *   Move from `(1.5, 2.0)` to `(-0.7, 2.15)` (`#o3` location for `v18`).
           *   Take image of `v18`.
           *   Move from `(-0.7, 2.15)` to `(1.0, 2.2)` (`#o3`

(Thoughts: **Addressing New Errors and Refining the Plan**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a fresh set of error messages indicating that my previous configurations are no good – they're either unreachable or lead to collisions.  I need to rethink my strategy. The primary goal remains the same: `new-axiom@0()`. This means getting rover `v14` to complete a series of tasks, including taking images, sampling rocks, sending data, and ending back at its initial position, while ensuring `v12` is undisturbed.
           
           Here's the situation: I've got obstacles in the environment I need to avoid, and I have to satisfy the `atconf` and `free` predicates.
           
           My main focus will be making sure the path of the rover `v14` is collision-free and that it can complete the actions.
           
           I've re-evaluated the locations of key objects: the objectives for imaging, the rocks to sample, and the obstacles. I've also noted the size of the robot based on its AABB which can guide how close I can get to objects and other obstacles.  I've inferred that the planner behind the scenes works with certain constraints on configurations, so I must stick to common sense and also provide suitable values for that planner.
           
           Now, let's nail down these configurations. Here are the positions I've come up with:
           
           *   **Imaging Locations (`#o3` values):**
               *   **For `v17` (2.17, 2.01):**  I'll place rover `v14` at `(1.5, 1.8)` units away.
               *   **For `v18` (-0.5, 2.15):**  I'll position `v14` at `(-1.2, 2.0)` units.
               *   **For `v19` (0.69, 2.2):** I'll put the rover at `(0.8, 1.8)` units.
           *   **Sampling Locations (`#o5` values):**
               *   **For `v4` and `v8` (rocks):**
               *   Above `v4`, I'll use `(-0.37, -0.2)` units.
               *   Above `v8`, I'll use `(-0.43, 0.4)` units.
           *   **Data Transmission (`#o0` value):**
               *   For `v9` (at (-1.9, -2.0) ): I'll move to `(-1.0, -1.0)`.
           
           I've double-checked these coordinates.  They seem reachable and collision-free. I am making sure not to collide with `v20`, `v21`, or `v22`.
           
           I've also refined the plan steps to ensure they are correct:
           
           1.  **Move** to the first image target `v17` and use `#o3_v17_pose`. Calibrate, then take the image.
           2.  **Move** to image target `v18`, using `#o3_v18_pose`. Calibrate, then take the image.
           3.  **Move** to image target `v19`, with `#o3_v19_pose`. Calibrate, then take the image.
           4.  **Move** to sample rock `v4`, with `#o5_v4_pose`.
           5.  **Sample** the stone rock `v4`.
           6.  **Drop** the stone rock `v4` and free the store for rock `v8`.
           7.  **Move** to sample rock `v8`, with `#o5_v8_pose`.
           8.  **Sample** the soil rock `v8`.
           9.  **Move** to the communication zone using `#o0_comm_pose`.
           10. **Send** the images.
           11. **Send** the analyses for the sampled rocks.
           12. **Drop** rock `v16` (to fulfill free condition for robot).
           13. **Move** back to start `v15`.
           
           I need to make sure this meets the `atconf` and `free` predicates at the start and end of the plan as well. I'm satisfied this should work now.
