           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Revised Plan for `new-axiom@0()` (PDDL Domain `rovers`)**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with generating a plan to achieve the `new-axiom@0()` goal in this rover domain. It's looking like a conjunction of conditions that need to be satisfied, and most of them are already met initially. I just need to figure out how to satisfy those damn `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           
           The initial state reveals a familiar setup: two rovers (v12 and v14), a camera (v10), and a lander (v9). I see some initial configuration information for these rovers, and, most importantly, I have image and communication visibility predicates. This gives me a good start. I also see that v14 is initially `atconf` *and* I have `comvisible` and `imagevisible` predicates. I have the facts. So, I need to figure out how to *use* them and *meet* the subgoals.
           
           The easy parts are already met: `atconf`, `free`.
           
           First, I need to send images. Looks like I've got three objectives (v17, v18, v19) to image and send. I decide to keep it simple and use rover v14 to do everything. I'm going to take a three-step process for each objective: *calibrate*, *take an image*, and *send the image.*
           
           Now comes the *interesting* part: the `calibration` and `take_image` require this seemingly elusive "configuration" that is referenced by `#` objects. I'm thinking I've gotta provide those. This means coordinates in the 2D space.  Because these `#` configurations show up in the *imagevisible* and *comvisible* predicates, I'm interpreting that I have to *define* these.  So, I start to work out the coordinates for my plan. I figure I can use the rover's location for the communication step, but those image-taking configurations need to be within a specific range.
           
           I figure out the ideal locations based on the object's position, staying within range of each objective.
           
           Now, for `receivedanalysis`, I need to *sample* and *send* rocks. I can use the same rover and lander. The store and its free status are there.
           I need to sample, and then communicate the results. I also need to make sure to `drop_rock` after I sample. To this end, I choose a stone and a soil sample, then make another plan based around the same three steps, *sample*, *send analysis* and *drop*, each for two rocks.
           I can then use a different `#` configuration for my sampling, which needs to be `above` the rock.
           
           The plan I need looks to be:
           
           1.  Calibrate for the first objective (`v17`) using my selected camera config (`#o3_v14_v17`).
           2.  Take an image of `v17`.
           3.  Send the image of `v17` to the lander.
           4.  Calibrate for the second objective (`v18`).
           5.  Take an image of `v18`.
           6.  Send the image.
           7.  Calibrate for the third objective (`v19`).
           8.  Take an image.
           9.  Send the image.
           10. Sample the rock (v3).
           11. Send analysis of rock (v3).
           12. Drop rock from store.
           13. Sample the soil (v7).
           14. Send the analysis.
           15. Drop the soil.
           
           Since there are no `move` actions and the configurations are implicitly available via `conf` and `imagevisible` and `comvisible`, and it implies that the continuous parameters are for the rays, the plan seems complete. Also I am assuming ray blocks are all false. I *think* I've got it, and this covers all the `new-axiom@0()` subgoals. My plan *should* work if all the predicates and facts are consistent and I did a good job making the rover collision-free in the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Problem with Strict Constraints**
           
           Okay, the user flagged the previous plan as invalid because I included actions outside the allowed set. My focus *must* be solely on the provided "list of valid action instances." Let's break this down.
           
           Initially, the goal state contains a mix of already satisfied predicates and some that are *not* satisfied. The key issue is those `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. I can see no path to satisfying them given the allowable actions.
           
           My allowed actions are severely limited: essentially, rovers can move (but stay in place) or drop rocks. It's clear that neither of these actions, even when cleverly sequenced, can achieve the core requirements of this goal, which include taking images, sending images, and running analyses.
           
           The problem explicitly restricts the plan to *only* actions in the provided list. Since the allowed actions cannot address the unmet goal predicates, any plan I create will be incomplete and, therefore, incorrect.
           
           Therefore, given the constraint of the problem definition, this goal is unreachable. I must indicate that no plan can be generated, providing a clear explanation based on the action restrictions.
