           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Here's how I'm thinking about this problem, and my proposed solution:**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 4 on surface 0. "Stable" means the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) is entirely contained within the surface's AABB, regardless of rotation.
           
           Object 4 has dimensions (0.07376779478686962, 0.07376779478686957) – effectively a square. Surface 0 is a square centered at (0,0) with bounds from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           A placement is a tuple: (surface index, rotation angle, x-coordinate, y-coordinate). Surface index will always be 0. The rotation angle (`theta`) determines how the object's AABB size will be changed due to rotation. The x and y coordinates indicate the center point of the object's AABB when it is placed on the surface.
           
           I've determined that the valid area for placement's center point is a smaller rectangle *inside* the surface's rectangle, so the object stays fully within the surface. The corners of this inner rectangle will depend on `theta`. I need to ensure the object's AABB remains within the valid area, no matter its rotation. I need to calculate the *maximum* AABB size, since I can put it in any orientation. The AABB dimensions `W` and `H` are calculated from the object's dimensions `w, h` and the rotation angle, using the `cos` and `sin` functions. Given that the object is nearly square (`w` and `h` are close), the AABB dimensions won't vary much with rotation, meaning `W` and `H` don't change very much as the angle changes. I can treat them as fixed for this analysis and placement.
           
           To create diverse and stable placements, I'll systematically vary both the rotation angle and the object's center position. I'll choose a variety of rotation angles (thetas) –  10 different angles covering a range of rotations from 0 to about pi. Using diverse thetas is crucial to ensuring a uniform distribution over the valid area for any object orientation.
           For the x, y positions, for each `theta`, I'll use a variety of points within the valid rectangular area. I'll pick a combination of the center point of this smaller rectangle, some corner points and middle edge points. These ensure I will have placements across the valid area.
           
           Specifically, I'll calculate the bounds for placing the center of the object for each rotation angle `theta`, then calculate the half width (`W/2`) and half height (`H/2`) of the bounding box based on that. I'm choosing *ten* rotation angles: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2, 5pi/8, 3pi/4, 7pi/8, pi, 9pi/8.
           
           For each `theta`, the x, y coordinates will use one of 5 positions, to ensure 50 stable and distinct placements. The center and opposing corners of the valid rectangle and the centers of left and top side (x coordinates). This way, each placement is diverse and stable. Each valid placement is added to the list. I make sure I stop at 50, even if I have more potential positions.
           This gives me 50 placements, each guaranteed stable and diverse in rotation and position, as required. All calculations use full precision. The output is 50 placements as tuples.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object ID 5: A Detailed Analysis**
           
           Okay, so I've got this new object, ID 5, and I need to place it on Surface 0 without any collisions, keeping in mind that object ID 4 is already smack-dab in the middle. Surface 0 is a square, 0.27 units on a side, centered at (0,0). Object ID 4? It's sitting pretty with no rotation at (0, 0, 0.0, 0.0). I've got to ensure the new object doesn't bump into it.
           
           Object 5's dimensions are roughly 0.0942 x 0.0942, so we're dealing with another nearly square object. The first task is determining the safe zones. Since the feedback said there was a successful placement for object 4,  I'll need to keep this in mind.
           
           First, I need to know the effective size of Object 5 at different rotations. I'm going to determine a way to generate 50 unique placements.
           
           The main challenge is collision avoidance, so it's time to dig into the math. Object 4's bounding box is easy. The key is in the effective width and height of Object 5 (let's call it W5 and H5) based on its rotation, represented by the angle theta.
           
           To avoid a collision, I must ensure that there's no overlap between the two bounding boxes. I'll need to derive the conditions for which the objects do not collide.
           
           Based on object 5's size and the known size of object 4, I derived the collision conditions using the concept of axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs). It comes down to either the x or y intervals never overlapping.
           
           With the sizes and surface boundries, the calculations showed that for a non-rotated object, or rotations close to that of object ID 4, it is challenging to place the object without overlap with ID 4. The calculations showed a very small range of "valid" x and y placements, creating a central collision zone in the middle of the surface.
           
           Then I checked for all rotations, in intervals of pi/8. Most of the angular placements created collision between object ID 5 with object 4. This limits my selection of usable angles. I need 50 valid placements.
           
           In order to overcome the difficulty in placement and generate 50 points, I will use four angles: `0`, `pi/2`, `pi`, `3pi/2` representing four AABB placements. Each one has small ranges of valid x,y values.
           
           To distribute the points, I'll generate points in those zones, creating a set of placements.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 6**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable and non-colliding locations for a new object (ID: 6) on surface 0.  I’ve got two other objects already placed (ID: 4 and ID: 5) to avoid. Object 6 is small, almost square. I’m thinking the best bet is to limit the possible rotations to 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees.  I have the surface boundaries and dimensions of all the objects, and now the challenge is to define a strategy for placement.
           
           First, I need to define the “forbidden zones” around Object 4 and Object 5.  This means calculating their AABBs (axis-aligned bounding boxes).  Then, for each possible rotation of Object 6, I’ll need to figure out its rotated AABB.  Using the surface bounds, I’ll calculate a valid region for the center of object 6. Then I’ll identify the regions that collide with objects 4 and 5, using the AABBs.
           
           The critical part is working out the intersection of these conditions:
           1.  **Object 6 must stay within the surface bounds.**
           2.  **Object 6 must *not* collide with Object 4.**
           3.  **Object 6 must *not* collide with Object 5.**
           
           I'll start with Object 6 at 0 degrees, which simplifies things. The AABB for object 6, will be used to define the available surface bounds. For example, if X and Y of the center is outside the forbidden regions by objects 4 and 5 it can't collide. Now the object 6's AABB for this fixed 0 rotation becomes valid based on the constraints. 
           
           My preliminary investigation leads to one viable region for placements. A small rectangular area in the top-right corner of surface 0. However, this is for 0 rotation. I expect that 0 rotation and 180 are quite similar, while 90 and 270 degrees will be different.  I will have to account for these rotations for an array of valid places. I will create a grid of points within this allowable space, making sure to avoid Object 4 and 5's forbidden zones, ensuring I generate the specified 50 unique placements.
