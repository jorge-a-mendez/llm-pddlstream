User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with walls at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5. There's a vertical partition along x=0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the room, including two large rectangles in the lower-left quadrant (obstacle 6) and in the upper-right quadrant (obstacle 7), and then a few smaller ones in the upper-left (obstacle 8, 10) and upper-right (obstacle 9, 19, 21, 22), as well as a few smaller ones scattered in the bottom half of the room (obstacles 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18). I will attempt to place the robot in open areas, avoiding these obstacles. I will prioritize positions that give a good view of the target, meaning a direct line of sight.
           
           Positions:
           (1.0 0.0)
           (1.5 0.0)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     The target point is at (-0.529, 2.071), which is in the upper-left quadrant. My previous attempts were to the right of the x=0 partition, which clearly blocked line-of-sight. This time I will focus on positions in the upper-left quadrant, closer to the target, to ensure line of sight. I also need to be careful to avoid obstacles 8, 10, 20, 22 in that general area.

Model:     The target point is now at (0.551, 1.948), which is in the upper-right quadrant. My previous attempts were in the upper-left, and I realize my error in not checking the target point in the second request. Now that I know the target is in the upper-right, I will try positions in that area, specifically avoiding obstacle 9, 19, 21 and the x=0 partition.
