User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.469, 0.45), (-4.371, 0.548)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.42, 0.499, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.33, 0.944).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains several objects, including `v8`, `v11`, `v14`, `v12`, `v15`, `v18`. There are also robot configurations `v3` (base), `v5` (arm for `v4`), and `v7` (arm for `v6`). The initial state shows that `v8` is at pose `v9` on `v11`, `v15` is at pose `v16` on `v11`, and `v12` is at pose `v13` on `v14`. All three objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v15`) are graspable. There are also several stackable relationships, notably `v12` and `v8` are stackable on `v18`. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires `on(green, v18)` and `type(green, v17)`. From the initial state, we know `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`. Therefore, we need to place either `v8` or `v12` on `v18`. Let's choose `v8` because it's currently on `v11`, which is relatively close to `v18` (both are on the right side of the robot).
           
           To achieve `on(v8, v18)`, we need to pick `v8` from its current pose `v9` and place it on `v18` at a new pose. The initial state provides the continuous parameter `#o2` as a pose for `v8` on `v18`, so we'll use that.
           
           The plan involves the following steps:
           1. Pick `v8` using arm `v4` from pose `v9` with grasp `#o1` using base configuration `#o3` and arm trajectory `#o4`.
           2. Place `v8` using arm `v4` at pose `#o2` on `v18` with grasp `#o1` using base configuration `#o3` and arm trajectory `#o4`.
           The `move_base` action is available, but the initial state already has `atbconf(v3)`, and the `kin` predicates for picking and placing specify `#o3` as the base configuration. Since there's a `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)` we could move the base to the same position, but it doesn't change anything. Thus, we will assume `#o3` is `v3` for simplicity.
           
           --Plan--:
           (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4)
           (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)
           
           --Poses--:
           (#o2 v8 v18): (4.5, 0.3, 0.8, 0.0)

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The only available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action moves the robot's base from configuration `v3` to `v3` using trajectory `#o0`. This action effectively moves the robot to the same position, incurring a cost of the distance between `v3` and `v3`, which is 0.
           
           The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which requires `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. From the initial state, we know `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`. To satisfy the goal, we need to place either `v8` or `v12` on `v18`.
           
           However, the `pick` and `place` actions are not available in the provided list of valid action instances. Without `pick` and `place` actions, it is impossible to move `v8` or `v12` onto `v18` from their current locations (`v11` and `v14` respectively). Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the given set of allowed actions.
