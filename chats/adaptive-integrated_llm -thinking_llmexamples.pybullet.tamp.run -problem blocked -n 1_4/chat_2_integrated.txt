User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.514, -0.051), (-4.428, 0.035)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.471, -0.008, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.795, 0.607).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's my thought process to achieve the goal `Atom new-axiom@0()`:**
           
           Okay, I need a plan to satisfy the goal.  `new-axiom@0()` requires me to make two things true: `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. The initial state gives me that `type(v12, v17)` and `type(v8, v17)` are true. This means the green object, `?green`, can be either `v12` or `v8`. The problem says `v18` is a surface.
           
           To satisfy `on(?green, v18)`, I need to get either `v12` or `v8` onto that surface, `v18`. Let's pick `v8` because it seems closer to the robot's initial base configuration. To put `v8` "on" `v18`, I need it to be both *supported* and *at a specific pose*. Luckily, the initial state already tells me `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is true.
           
           The robot starts with its base at `v3` and the arm is empty, `handempty(v4)`. The current situation is that `v8` is at `v9`. So, my plan needs to *pick* `v8` from `v9` and *place* it onto `v18`.  Since I have the action `move_base` and the problem mentions `kin`, I need to move the base to be near the object I want to move. I'll need to move the base, pick up the object, move the base back to the target location for the object and then place it down.
           
           Looking at the actions, I can move the base, pick, and place.  I have the following actions:
           - `((move_base v3 #o3 #o0))`
           - `((pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4))`
           - `((place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4))`
           
           The pick and place actions use a `kin` predicate, which I am assuming defines the reachability for the arm from different base configurations. The place and pick actions have the same base configuration `#o3` so I can use the same base position for both actions.
           
           Based on the preconditions, I need to assume that  I can pick and place safely (I can assume `unsafeapproach`, `unsafepose` and `unsafeatraj` are all false).  So, the plan looks like this:
           
           1.  **Move the base** from `v3` to `#o3`.
           2.  **Pick** `v8` from `v9`.
           3.  **Place** `v8` at `#o2`.
           
           After checking the actions, I need to ensure that the robot is initially at `atbconf(v3)` and I need to prove that all other action's preconditions are met after each step. Since the actions use `#o1`, `#o2`, `#o3`, `#o4` and `#o0`, they are dependent on my continuous values I need to provide.
           
           Now, for the key part: filling in the missing continuous values. The initial state doesn't provide all of the details I would like (for example the exact size of the objects), but the problem states that `pose(obj, #<name>)` means I need to provide `obj` to `#<name>`. Since `pose(v8, #o2)` is in the initial state, I must specify a value for `#o2`.
           
           The object `v8` has a known size, as its AABB, and `v18` (the surface), as well as a defined surface height. I calculated the position of the new object `#o2` so that when `v8` is on the surface `v18`, the object is at `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`.
           
           *   I set `#o2` to be `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)` for the pose of the object to be on the surface, which is a position and orientation.
           
           *   I don't need values for `#o1`, since it represents a grasp and is not a pose object.
           
           *   Now I need values for base position, trajectory (for the base and arm) based on the kinematic information.
           
           *   I am assuming that `#o3` represents a base configuration (the base coordinates) where the base robot's arm can reach both `v9` and `#o2
