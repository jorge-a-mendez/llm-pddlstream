User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object

           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.514, -0.051), (-4.428, 0.035)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.471, -0.008, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.795, 0.607).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching the Unreachable: A Detailed Analysis**
           
           My objective is to devise a plan to satisfy the goal, `(new-axiom@0)`, which translates to placing an object, `?green`, of a specific type, `v17`, onto a surface, `v18`. From the initial state and available axioms, it's clear that to achieve this, I need to find an object of type `v17` and manipulate it to be `on v18`.
           
           Two objects, `v12` and `v8`, are identified as possessing the requisite type `v17`. Examining their initial states reveals that `v8` is currently situated at pose `v9`, supported by `v11`, while `v12` is at pose `v13` supported by `v14`. Both are graspable. My initial strategy was to use the `pick` and `place` actions, using arm `v4`, to manipulate `v8` onto `v18`.  
           
           My thought process then turned to formulating the plan. Since I am an expert in this field, I know that to execute a `pick`, I would need to grasp `v8` at `#o1` from its current pose `v9`, using the robot's base configuration `v3` and then the arm trajectory `#o4`. To place, I would use `#o2` which is the new pose of `v8` on `v18`, with the same grasp `#o1` the robot's base configuration `v3` and the arm trajectory `#o4`.
           
           However, the problem introduces a critical constraint: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." The only action instance provided is a null base motion, `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. The `pick` and `place` actions that I had initially planned to employ are not listed.
           
           Since an expert must consider this crucial constraint, I then came to the crucial realization:  the only actions *allowed* are those explicitly enumerated. This directly implies the infeasibility of the original goal. While it's trivial to calculate the poses, grasps, and arm trajectories needed to perform `pick` and `place`, the absence of those specific *action instances* means that I *cannot* achieve the goal. Therefore, the task is unsolvable given these constraints.
