User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.514, -0.051), (-4.428, 0.035)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.471, -0.008, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.795, 0.607).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom pose(v15, v16)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)
           Atom type(v12, v17)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom stackable(v8, v18)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom graspable(v15)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom stackable(v15, v10)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom stackable(v12, v18)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v14)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom type(v8, v17)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Plan for a New Axiom**
           
           My primary goal is to establish the `new-axiom@0`, which boils down to ensuring that an object, which I'll call `green_object`, is both *on* `v18` and of type `v17`. My initial assessment reveals two potential candidates for `green_object`: `v12` and `v8`, both having type `v17`.
           
           To satisfy the *on* condition, I need to make `green_object` both *supported by* a pose and *atpose* at that same pose on `v18`. I know from the initial state that neither `v12` nor `v8` is currently positioned on `v18`. This calls for moving either object to v18, but the actions allowed are limited. The only valid action seems to be `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action doesn't move objects. Since neither `v12` nor `v8` starts out on `v18`, it means the *on* part of the requirement, `(on ?green v18)`, will not be achievable with the given action, the goal is unreachable.
