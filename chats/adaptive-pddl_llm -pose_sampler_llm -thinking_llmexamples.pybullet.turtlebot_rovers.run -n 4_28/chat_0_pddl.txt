           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable: Insufficient Actions**
           
           My primary goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. Examining its definition, I see it's a conjunction of several conditions, notably requiring that I've received images of objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20 in mode v11) and received analyses of both a stone and soil.  Analyzing the initial state, I confirm that *none* of these `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates are true at the outset.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`, I'd need the action `send_image`.  Similarly, for `receivedanalysis`, I'd require `send_analysis`.  However, scrutinizing the *only* available actions – `move` and `drop_rock` – it's immediately clear that none of them have any effect on these 'receive' predicates. They are completely outside of their capabilities.
           
           The critical issue is the lack of any actions that *create* the necessary preconditions for `send_image` and `send_analysis`. For example, `send_image` itself requires the rovers to be at a specific configuration (#o0, #o3). And `send_image` requires haveimage, the precondition for which is `take_image`, and `take_image` requires atconf at the configuration (#o3). This configuration is not something the rovers start in, and they are not able to move into this state using `move`. So, the entire sequence to take an image, and send it, are not possible.  Similarly, there is no pathway to get the rovers in the right state to analyze the samples.
           
           Given that I'm restricted to the `move` and `drop_rock` actions, and that these actions *cannot* establish the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` facts necessary for the goal, I must conclude that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently *unreachable*. No possible plan exists using the given action set to satisfy these key conditions. I must return without offering any plan, as none can exist.
