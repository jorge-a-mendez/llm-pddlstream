           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm looking at this problem in the `rovers` domain, aiming for `new-axiom@0()`. First, I'm breaking down what this goal actually *means*. It's a conjunction of several conditions: two rovers need to be at specific configurations (`atconf`), both rovers need a free store (`free`), and then we have a bunch of image and analysis reception requirements. Specifically, I need images received for three objectives in a particular mode (`receivedimage`), and analyses received for a rock and a soil sample (both `receivedanalysis` and specific `type` facts).
           
           Looking at the initial state, the `atconf` and `free` conditions are already satisfied. That's a good start. The available actions seem to be just `move` and `drop_rock`. But those won't get me the images or analyses I need. To get an image, I would need a `take_image` followed by a `send_image` action. And to get the analysis, I'd need a `sample_rock` followed by a `send_analysis`. Crucially, these required actions are not present in the list of valid actions I'm given.
           
           So, I'm checking the initial state and axioms to see if there's any way around needing those actions, maybe something is already true or can be inferred somehow. However, the initial state doesn't have any of the required `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` facts. The goal, by definition, is not already satisfied. And the "blocked" axiom seems irrelevant here. I'm starting to think this is a bit of a trick.
           
           Since I can only use `move` and `drop_rock`, and neither of those touch anything related to getting images or analyses, it looks like there's no way to achieve the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` parts of the goal. The actions needed to actually *get* the data (the `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` actions) aren't available to me. Thus, the goal is *unreachable* given the limited action set. It's impossible. I'm going to have to conclude that this goal cannot be accomplished, as frustrating as that may be! I need those actions.
