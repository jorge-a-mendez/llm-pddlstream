User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Object v1 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.839, 0.194), (1.945, 0.3)).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem requires satisfying the `new-axiom@0` goal which is a conjunction of several conditions. Let's break down `new-axiom@0`:
           ```
           Axiom new-axiom@0()
             Conjunction
               Atom atconf(v12, v13)
               Atom atconf(v14, v15)
               Atom free(v12, v16)
               Atom free(v14, v16)
               Atom receivedimage(v17, v11)
               Atom receivedimage(v18, v11)
               Atom type(?stone, v2)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?stone)
               Atom type(?soil, v6)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?soil)
           ```
           
           From the initial state, we already have:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`
           - `free(v12, v16)`
           - `free(v14, v16)`
           
           So, the remaining subgoals are:
           1. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           2. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           3. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for all objects of type `v2` (stone).
           4. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for all objects of type `v6` (soil).
           
           Let's identify the objects of type `v2` (stone) and `v6` (soil) from the initial state:
           - `type(v3, v2)`: v3 is a stone
           - `type(v4, v2)`: v4 is a stone
           - `type(v1, v2)`: v1 is a stone
           - `type(v7, v6)`: v7 is soil
           - `type(v8, v6)`: v8 is soil
           - `type(v5, v6)`: v5 is soil
           
           Therefore, we need to achieve `receivedanalysis` for `v1`, `v3`, `v4` (stones) and `v5`, `v7`, `v8` (soils).
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`:
           We need `take_image` followed by `send_image`.
           For `receivedimage(v17, v11)`:
             - We need `haveimage(rover, v17, v11)`.
             - To get this, we need to call `take_image(rover, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`.
             - Preconditions: `imagevisible(rover, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `onboard(v10, rover)`, `supports(v10, v11)`, `atconf(rover, #o3)`, `calibrated(v10, rover)`, `~blocked(#o4)`.
             - `onboard(v10, v12)` and `onboard(v10, v14)` are true.
             - `supports(v10, v11)` is true.
             - `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` are true.
             - `conf(v14, #o3)` and `conf(v12, #o3)` are true.
             - So, we can use either rover v12 or v14. Let's use v12.
             - We need to calibrate `v10` for `v12` first: `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)`.
             - Then `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`.
             - Then `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`.
             - Preconditions for `send_image`: `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`, `haveimage(v12, v17, v11)`, `atconf(v12, #o0)`, `~blocked(#o1)`.
             - `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` is true.
             - `conf(v12, #o0)` is true.
           
           For `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
             - Similar steps as above. Let's use rover v14.
             - `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` is true.
             - `calibrate(v14, #o3, #o4, v18, v10)`.
             - Then `take_image(v14, #o3, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`.
             - Then `send_image(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`.
             - Preconditions for `send_image`: `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`, `haveimage(v14, v18, v11)`, `atconf(v14, #o0)`, `~blocked(#o1)`.
             - `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` is true.
             - `conf(v14, #o0)` is true.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis`:
           For each rock (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`), we need to:
           1. `sample_rock(rover, #o5, rock, v16)`
           2. `send_analysis(rover, #o0, #o1, v9, rock)`
           
           We have two rovers: `v12` and `v14`. Both have `free(rover, v16)` initially.
           For `v1`: `rock(v1)`, `type(v1, v2)`. `above(v12, #o5, v1)` and `above(v14, #o5, v1)` are true. Let's use `v12`.
             - `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v1, v16)`
             - `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v1)`
           For `v3`: `rock(v3)`, `type(v3, v2)`. `above(v12, #o5, v3)` and `above(v14, #o5, v3)` are true. We will need to drop the rock `v1` from `v12`'s store to sample another one. Or use `v14`. Let's use `v14` for some rocks and `v12` for others.
           Let's assign:
           `v12`: `v1`, `v3`, `v4`
           `v14`: `v5`, `v7`, `v8`
           
           Let's refine the analysis plan:
           **Rover v12:**
           - `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v1, v16)` (now `full(v12, v16)`, `analyzed(v12, v1)`)
           - `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v1)` (now `receivedanalysis(v1)`)
           - `drop_rock(v12, v16)` (now `free(v12, v16)`)
           - `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v3, v16)` (now `full(v12, v16)`, `analyzed(v12, v3)`)
           - `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v3)` (now `receivedanalysis(v3)`)
           - `drop_rock(v12, v16)` (now `free(v12, v16)`)
           - `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v4, v16)` (now `full(v12, v16)`, `analyzed(v12, v4)`)
           - `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v4)` (now `receivedanalysis(v4)`)
           - `drop_rock(v12, v16)` (now `free(v12, v16)`)
           
           **Rover v14:**
           - `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v5, v16)` (now `full(v14, v16)`, `analyzed(v14, v5)`)
           - `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v5)` (now `receivedanalysis(v5)`)
           - `drop_rock(v14, v16)` (now `free(v14, v16)`)
           - `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v7, v16)` (now `full(v14, v16)`, `analyzed(v14, v7)`)
           - `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v7)` (now `receivedanalysis(v7)`)
           - `drop_rock(v14, v16)` (now `free(v14, v16)`)
           - `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v8, v16)` (now `full(v14, v16)`, `analyzed(v14, v8)`)
           - `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v8)` (now `receivedanalysis(v8)`)
           - `drop_rock(v14, v16)` (now `free(v14, v16)`)
           
           Continuous values for `#o0`, `#o1`, `#o3`, `#o4`, `#o5` will need to be provided.
           For `#o0` and `#o1` (comvisible), the target is `v9` (lander).
           For `#o3` and `#o4` (imagevisible), the targets are `v17` and `v18` (objectives).
           For `#o5` (above), the targets are the rocks `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           
           Let's assume the continuous parameters are unique for each specific action if the target object is different, even if the named parameter is the same in the PDDL initial state. However, the problem statement says "If your plan uses some object #<name>... and you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name."
           So for `#o0`, since `v9` is the target for both `v12` and `v14`, we can reuse the same values for both rovers for `comvisible`.
           For `#o3`, since `v17` is a target for `v12` and `v14`, and `v18` is a target for `v12` and `v14`, we will need 4 configs (or two distinct for `v17` and `v18` which can be shared between rovers). Given the problem wording, it implies a unique configuration for each (rover, target) pair, so let's specify them as such if used.
           For `#o5`, since it's used for multiple rocks with both rovers, we will need several unique `(rover, rock)` configurations.
           
           Let's ensure that we provide values for all required `#o` objects. The provided AABBs are for fixed objects in the scene.
           - `v9` (lander): ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))
           - `v17` (objective): ((-0.444, 1.813), (-0.345, 1.912))
           - `v18` (objective): ((-1.855, 2.042), (-1.784, 2.113))
           
           Let's pick the specific configurations for each action.
           For `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`: `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75, 0.0). `v9` is at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). A good point for `#o0` could be close to `v13`, say `(1.0, -1.75)`. The center of `v9` is around `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           For `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`: `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75, 0.0). `v17` is at ((-0.444, 1.813), (-0.345, 1.912)). A good point for `#o3` could be near `v13` but angled towards `v17`.
           For `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`: `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0). `v18` is at ((-1.855, 2.042), (-1.784, 2.113)). A good point for `#o3` could be near `v15` but angled towards `v18`.
           For `above(rover, #o5, rock)`: `#o5` should be above the rock. The configuration `v13` (1.0, -1.75) for `v12` and `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) for `v14` are suitable starting points.
           
           Let's define the continuous values for the configuration and ray objects.
           We'll assume the ray points from the rover's configuration towards the center of the target object's AABB.
           For `v9` (lander): center `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           For `v17` (objective): center `(-0.394, 1.8625)`.
           For `v18` (objective): center `(-1.8195, 2.0775)`.
           For `v1` (rock): center `(1.892, 0.247)`.
           For `v3` (rock): center `(2.175, -0.446)`.
           For `v4` (rock): center `(-0.975, -1.026)`.
           For `v5` (rock): center `(0.9695, -0.774)`.
           For `v7` (rock): center `(1.926, -2.174)`.
           For `v8` (rock): center `(-1.9305, -0.33)`.
           
           `#o0` (comms config), `#o1` (comms ray):
             - Rover `v12` (at `v13`: 1.0, -1.75) to `v9` (center: -1.9, -2.0). A config `q_comms_v12_v9` could be `(1.0, -1.75)`. Ray from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
             - Rover `v14` (at `v15`: -1.0, -1.75) to `v9` (center: -1.9, -2.0). A config `q_comms_v14_v9` could be `(-1.0, -1.75)`. Ray from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           Since `comvisible` is given for both `v12` and `v14` with the same `#o0` and `#o1`, and the problem states to use the same `#o0` and `#o1` unless it's a new (rover, target) pair, we should clarify this. "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration". Since `conf(v12, #o0)` and `conf(v14, #o0)` are in the initial state, and `#o0` is used for `comvisible` with `v9` as target, we need to provide a value for `#o0` for (v12, v9) and (v14, v9). It is likely they should be different, but the problem states `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`. So there is only one `#o0` and `#o1`.
           The instruction: "you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name." This implies if the *same* `#oN` is used for different (rover, target) pairs, we need to specify different values for it for each such pair.
           So for `(v12, v9)` and `(v14, v9)` both using `#o0`, we'd expect `conf_o0_v12_v9` and `conf_o0_v14_v9`. Let's assume the question meant we need to specify a value for the `#o0` *used with* `v12` and `v9`, and a value for the `#o0` *used with* `v14` and `v9`, even if the symbol is the same. This is a bit ambiguous, but let's treat the `#oN` as a placeholder for a specific instantiation for each (rover, target) pair when used in predicates like `imagevisible` or `comvisible` that take a rover and a target, as per the instruction.
           
           So, let's create unique names for the configurations we'll define:
           - `q_comms_v12_v9` for `v12` to `v9`
           - `q_comms_v14_v9` for `v14` to `v9`
           - `q_image_v12_v17` for `v12` to `v17`
           - `q_image_v14_v18` for `v14` to `v18`
           - `q_above_v12_v1` for `v12` above `v1`
           - `q_above_v12_v3` for `v12` above `v3`
           - `q_above_v12_v4` for `v12` above `v4`
           - `q_above_v14_v5` for `v14` above `v5`
           - `q_above_v14_v7` for `v14` above `v7`
           - `q_above_v14_v8` for `v14` above `v8`
           
           The initial state given:
           `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`
           `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`
           `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           `above(v14, #o5, v7)`
           `above(v12, #o5, v7)`
           `above(v14, #o5, v5)`
           `above(v12, #o5, v5)`
           `above(v12, #o5, v3)`
           `above(v14, #o5, v3)`
           `above(v12, #o5, v4)`
           `above(v14, #o5, v4)`
           `above(v12, #o5, v8)`
           `above(v14, #o5, v8)`
           `above(v12, #o5, v1)`
           `above(v14, #o5, v1)`
           
           Based on the prompt: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration such that ... you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name."
           This means that if a *symbol* like `#o0` or `#o3` or `#o5` is used in multiple contexts (e.g. `v12` to `v9` vs `v14` to `v9`), we need to provide separate specific coordinate values *for that symbol* per `(rover, target)` pair. To avoid confusion for the parser, I will use the originally provided `#oN` names, but make clear that their values are specific to the (rover, target) pair.
           
           Let's assume the continuous parameters are unique for each (rover, target) pair, and the # objects represent placeholders for these values.
           
           Example: `#o0` refers to the configuration for `comvisible`.
           - For `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`, we use the configuration for `v12` to `v9`.
           - For `send_image(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`, we use the configuration for `v14` to `v9`.
           
           For `#o2` used in `motion(v12, v13, #o2, v13)` and `motion(v14, v15, #o2, v15)`, these actions do not change the configuration, so `#o2` represents a null trajectory, which doesn't need a specific value.
           
           The strategy:
           1. Calibrate camera on `v12` for `v17`. Take image of `v17`. Send image of `v17` using `v12`.
           2. Calibrate camera on `v14` for `v18`. Take image of `v18`. Send image of `v18` using `v14`.
           3. For all rocks: `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`. Use `v12` for `v1`, `v3`, `v4` and `v14` for `v5`, `v7`, `v8`, managing the store by `drop_rock`.
           
           The configuration for imaging `v17` and `v18` can be the same `#o3` if it satisfies the conditions for both `v17` and `v18` and for both rovers. But the problem states "you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair". So we must define `#o3` for `(v12, v17)`, and `#o3` for `(v14, v18)`.
           Similarly for `#o5` which is used for `above`.
           
           Coordinates for the configurations:
           - `v12` at `v13`: (1.0, -1.75)
           - `v14` at `v15`: (-1.0, -1.75)
           
           Target coordinates:
           - `v9` (lander): center `(-1.9, -2.0)`
           - `v17` (objective): center `(-0.394, 1.8625)`
           - `v18` (objective): center `(-1.8195, 2.0775)`
           - `v1` (rock): center `(1.892, 0.247)`
           - `v3` (rock): center `(2.175, -0.446)`
           - `v4` (rock): center `(-0.975, -1.026)`
           - `v5` (rock): center `(0.9695, -0.774)`
           - `v7` (rock): center `(1.926, -2.174)`
           - `v8` (rock): center `(-1.9305, -0.33)`
           
           Distances:
           - `v12` (1.0, -1.75) to `v9` (-1.9, -2.0): `sqrt((1 - (-1.9))^2 + (-1.75 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt(2.9^2 + 0.25^2) = sqrt(8.41 + 0.0625) = sqrt(8.4725) approx 2.91` (OK for comms, max 4)
           - `v14` (-1.0, -1.75) to `v9` (-1.9, -2.0): `sqrt((-1 - (-1.9))^2 + (-1.75 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt(0.9^2 + 0.25^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 0.0625) = sqrt(0.8725) approx 0.93` (OK for comms, max 4)
           - `v12` (1.0, -1.75) to `v17` (-0.394, 1.8625): `sqrt((1 - (-0.394))^2 + (-1.75 - 1.8625)^2) = sqrt(1.394^2 + (-3.6125)^2) = sqrt(1.943 + 13.05) = sqrt(14.993) approx 3.87` (OK for image, max 2 - this is too far. We need to move the rover or pick a closer one)
           
           Wait, the problem does not provide `move` actions for rovers to *new* configurations, only `move v12 v13 #o2 v13` (move `v12` from `v13` to `v13` along trajectory `#o2`) and `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`. This means the rovers `v12` and `v14` are fixed at `v13` and `v15` respectively for the entire plan.
           This significantly simplifies the problem: all configurations starting with `#` in `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` must be reachable from `v13` or `v15` (depending on the rover) and be collision-free and have line of sight. But if the rovers can't move, then the only available configurations for them are `v13` and `v15` (and the ones with `#` that are "atconf" in the initial state). This implies that `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are "atconf" configurations that are the same as `v13` or `v15` (or a very slight variation for the camera/arm pose, not robot base).
           The problem statement: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration..."
           The initial state *does* contain `conf(v12, #o0)`, `conf(v14, #o0)`, `conf(v14, #o3)`, `conf(v12, #o3)`, `conf(v14, #o5)`, `conf(v12, #o5)`.
           This means these `#oN` configs are possible *current* configurations for the rovers.
           
           Let's re-evaluate distances from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) and `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           - `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `v17` (center `(-0.394, 1.8625)`): distance `3.87` (too far for image, max 2).
           - `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `v18` (center `(-1.8195, 2.0775)`): distance `sqrt((1 - (-1.8195))^2 + (-1.75 - 2.0775)^2) = sqrt(2.8195^2 + (-3.8275)^2) = sqrt(7.949 + 14.65) = sqrt(22.599) approx 4.75` (too far for image, max 2).
           - `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `v17` (center `(-0.394, 1.8625)`): distance `sqrt((-1 - (-0.394))^2 + (-1.75 - 1.8625)^2) = sqrt((-0.606)^2 + (-3.6125)^2) = sqrt(0.367 + 13.05) = sqrt(13.417) approx 3.66` (too far for image, max 2).
           - `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `v18` (center `(-1.8195, 2.0775)`): distance `sqrt((-1 - (-1.8195))^2 + (-1.75 - 2.0775)^2) = sqrt(0.8195^2 + (-3.8275)^2) = sqrt(0.671 + 14.65) = sqrt(15.321) approx 3.91` (too far for image, max 2).
           
           It seems that `v17` and `v18` are unreachable by *any* rover for `take_image` if they are constrained to `v13` and `v15` for their base configurations. The `imagevisible` predicate itself has an `imagerange` constraint (max distance 2). The provided `imagerange` facts: `imagerange(v14, #o3, v17)`, `imagerange(v12, #o3, v17)`, `imagerange(v14, #o3, v18)`, `imagerange(v12, #o3, v18)`. These facts simply state that *some* configuration `#o3` (which is specified in the initial state with `conf(rover, #o3)`) is in range, but it doesn't mean `v13` or `v15` is. The prompt states "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state... you must provide a continuous value...". This means these `#oN` are valid robot configurations *that are already in the initial state*. We are not limited to `v13` or `v15` for imaging/comms if these `#oN` are also `atconf` points, but the initial state only provides `atconf(v14, v15)` and `atconf(v12, v13)`. This means the rovers are currently at `v13` and `v15`. To use `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` for actions, the rover must be `atconf` at those configurations. The only allowed move actions don't change the rover's location. This indicates a potential unreachability for `take_image`.
           
           Let's re-read the move action carefully:
           `move(?v: object, ?q1: object, ?t: object, ?q2: object)`
           `Precondition: motion(?v, ?q1, ?t, ?q2) atconf(?v, ?q1)`
           `Effects: atconf(?v, ?q2) NegatedAtom atconf(?v, ?q1)`
           The available actions are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`. These actions move `v12` from `v13` to `v13` and `v14` from `v15` to `v15`. This confirms the rovers *cannot change their base configuration*.
           
           Therefore, the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates must be satisfiable *from the current rover configurations* (`v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14`). If the distances calculated are too large, the goal is unreachable.
           Given:
           - `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75)
           - `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)
           - `v17` (objective) is `((-0.444, 1.813), (-0.345, 1.912))`, center `(-0.394, 1.8625)`.
           - `v18` (objective) is `((-1.855, 2.042), (-1.784, 2.113))`, center `(-1.8195, 2.0775)`.
           
           Distance from `v12` to `v17` is `3.87` (max 2 for `imagevisible`).
           Distance from `v14` to `v18` is `3.91` (max 2 for `imagevisible`).
           These distances are indeed too large for the `imagevisible` predicate, which explicitly states "The maximum distance from the rover to the target is 2 for `imagevisible`".
           Since the rovers cannot move, and the objectives `v17` and `v18` are out of range for imaging, the subgoals `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)` cannot be achieved. Therefore, the overall goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable.
           
           The problem specifically says: "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is *false*." And "Never assume that any precondition is true by default: it must either be explicitly stated in the initial state, or be achieved by a previous action (and not undone by another action)."
           The `imagevisible` predicate has an `imagerange` constraint. For `imagevisible(v, q, y, o)`, `q` is the configuration, `y` is the ray, and `o` is the objective. The distance between `v` at `q` and `o` must be `<= 2`.
           The initial state contains `imagerange(v14, #o3, v17)`, `imagerange(v12, #o3, v17)`, etc. These statements are merely declarations that *such a configuration exists*. However, to use `take_image`, the rover must be `atconf` at that specific configuration (`#o3` in this case). The current `atconf` facts are only `atconf(v14, v15)` and `atconf(v12, v13)`. No `atconf(v12, #o3)` or `atconf(v14, #o3)` is given. And no actions allow changing `atconf` from `v13` to `#o3` or `v15` to `#o3`.
           This makes the `take_image` actions impossible if they require the rover to be at a configuration other than `v13` or `v15`.
           
           The phrase "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state... then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration..." implies that the configuration `q` in `imagevisible(v, q, y, o)` is a *pose* of the robot. If that pose is `#o3`, and `conf(v12, #o3)` is in the initial state, then `#o3` is a valid pose. But `atconf(v12, #o3)` is not in the initial state. The rover must be `atconf` at a specific location to perform an action from that location.
           
           Therefore, the only possible configurations for `v12` and `v14` are `v13` and `v15` respectively, as these are the only `atconf` locations. Since imaging objectives `v17` and `v18` from these fixed locations is out of range, the task is indeed impossible.
           
           Final check on the interpretation of `#oN` vs `atconf`.
           `conf(v12, #o0)` and `conf(v12, #o3)` and `conf(v12, #o5)` are in the initial state. This means these are *valid configurations* for `v12`. But `atconf(v12, v13)` is the only *current configuration* for `v12`. No movement allows reaching `#o0`, `#o3`, or `#o5` if they are distinct from `v13`.
           The only move actions are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`. These are no-op moves regarding the *base* configuration.
           This confirms the rovers are static. And if static, they cannot reach `v17` or `v18` for imaging.
           
           The goal is unreachable.
