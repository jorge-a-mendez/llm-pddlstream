           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem requires satisfying the `new-axiom@0()` which is a conjunction of several conditions. These conditions are:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover v12 is at configuration v13. (Already true in initial state)
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover v14 is at configuration v15. (Already true in initial state)
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: Rover v12 has a free store v16. (Already true in initial state)
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: Rover v14 has a free store v16. (Already true in initial state)
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: An image of objective v17 in mode v11 has been received.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: An image of objective v18 in mode v11 has been received.
           7. `type(?stone, v2)`: Some object of type v2 (stone) exists. (True for v1, v3, v4)
           8. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: An analysis of a stone has been received.
           9. `type(?soil, v6)`: Some object of type v6 (soil) exists. (True for v5, v7, v8)
           10. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: An analysis of soil has been received.
           
           Let's break down how to achieve the remaining conditions:
           
           **Achieving `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:**
           This requires the following steps for each objective:
           - Calibrate a camera for the objective.
           - Take an image of the objective.
           - Send the image to the lander.
           
           For `v17` and `v18`, we can use `v12` or `v14` and camera `v10`. Both rovers have `imagevisible` predicates for both `v17` and `v18` at configuration `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           Since `v12` is at `v13` and `v14` is at `v15`, they both need to move to `#o3` first if we choose to use `#o3`. However, the initial state has `imagevisible` predicates for both rovers and both objectives at `#o3`.
           
           Let's use `v12` to handle both images.
           1. `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)`
           2. `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`
           3. `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v18, v10)` (Camera needs recalibration after taking an image)
           4. `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`
           
           To send the images, `v12` needs to be in a configuration where `comvisible` to `v9` is true. We have `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`. So `v12` needs to move to `#o0`.
           5. `move(v12, #o3, #o2, #o0)` (if it was at #o3)
           6. `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`
           7. `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`
           
           **Achieving `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`:**
           This requires:
           - Sample a rock/soil.
           - Send the analysis.
           
           For a stone (`v2`): `v1`, `v3`, `v4` are rocks of type `v2`. Let's pick `v4`.
           For soil (`v6`): `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are rocks of type `v6`. Let's pick `v8`.
           
           Both rovers `v12` and `v14` have `above` predicates for rocks `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           Since `v12` is at `v13` and `v14` is at `v15`, they both need to move to `#o5` first if we choose to use `#o5`.
           
           Let's use `v14` to analyze a stone and `v12` to analyze soil, to potentially parallelize or at least keep the rovers separate.
           
           For stone (`v4`):
           1. `move(v14, v15, #o2, #o5)`
           2. `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v4, v16)`
           3. `move(v14, #o5, #o2, #o0)` (to send analysis)
           4. `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v4)`
           
           For soil (`v8`):
           1. `move(v12, v13, #o2, #o5)`
           2. `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v8, v16)`
           3. `move(v12, #o5, #o2, #o0)` (to send analysis)
           4. `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v8)`
           
           Now let's combine and sequence the actions. It seems efficient to first do all image-related tasks, then all analysis-related tasks, or mix them if the rovers can work independently. The problem description suggests that all actions are sequential, as there's only one state.
           
           Let's use `v12` for all image tasks and `v14` for all analysis tasks.
           
           **Rover v12 (Imaging):**
           1. Move `v12` to `#o3` for imaging.
           2. Calibrate camera for `v17`.
           3. Take image of `v17`.
           4. Calibrate camera for `v18`.
           5. Take image of `v18`.
           6. Move `v12` to `#o0` for communication.
           7. Send image of `v17`.
           8. Send image of `v18`.
           
           **Rover v14 (Analysis):**
           1. Move `v14` to `#o5` for sampling.
           2. Sample `v4` (stone).
           3. Move `v14` to `#o0` for communication.
           4. Send analysis of `v4`.
           5. Move `v14` back to `#o5` (since it moved to #o0 for sending analysis)
           6. Sample `v8` (soil).
           7. Move `v14` to `#o0` for communication.
           8. Send analysis of `v8`.
           
           Let's check the initial state. `v12` is at `v13`. `v14` is at `v15`.
           `#o3` is needed for `imagevisible`. `#o5` is needed for `above`. `#o0` is needed for `comvisible`.
           
           Plan:
           1. `v12` moves to `#o3` (from `v13`)
           2. `v12` calibrates for `v17`
           3. `v12` takes image of `v17`
           4. `v12` calibrates for `v18` (camera is no longer calibrated after `take_image`)
           5. `v12` takes image of `v18`
           6. `v12` moves to `#o0` (from `#o3`)
           7. `v12` sends image of `v17`
           8. `v12` sends image of `v18`
           
           9. `v14` moves to `#o5` (from `v15`)
           10. `v14` samples `v4` (stone)
           11. `v14` moves to `#o0` (from `#o5`)
           12. `v14` sends analysis of `v4`
           13. `v14` moves to `#o5` (from `#o0`)
           14. `v14` samples `v8` (soil)
           15. `v14` moves to `#o0` (from `#o5`)
           16. `v14` sends analysis of `v8`
           
           This plan covers all the conditions in the `new-axiom@0()`.
           
           Let's consider the AABB values for possible collision avoidance for the continuous values.
           v8 (soil): ((-1.999, -0.399), (-1.862, -0.261))
           v5 (soil): ((0.919, -0.825), (1.02, -0.723))
           v17 (objective): ((-0.444, 1.813), (-0.345, 1.912))
           v9 (lander): ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))
           v18 (objective): ((-1.855, 2.042), (-1.784, 2.113))
           v3 (stone): ((2.122, -0.499), (2.228, -0.393))
           v1 (stone): ((1.839, 0.194), (1.945, 0.3))
           v7 (soil): ((1.872, -2.228), (1.98, -2.12))
           v4 (stone): ((-1.028, -1.079), (-0.922, -0.973))
           v14 (rover): at (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0) initially
           v12 (rover): at (1.0, -1.75, 3.142) initially
           
           For `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`:
           Rover v12 is at (1.0, -1.75). Target v17 is at approx (-0.39, 1.86). Target v18 is at approx (-1.82, 2.07). These are quite far, but the problem states `imagevisible` is true. The maximum distance is 2. The distance from (1.0, -1.75) to (-0.39, 1.86) is sqrt((1.0 - (-0.39))^2 + (-1.75 - 1.86)^2) = sqrt(1.39^2 + (-3.61)^2) = sqrt(1.9321 + 13.0321) = sqrt(14.96) approx 3.86 which is > 2. So the rover *cannot* see v17 or v18 from this position or close by. The `imagevisible` predicates are given, so we assume a configuration `#o3` exists within range for both objectives.
           
           For `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`:
           Lander v9 is at approx (-1.9, -2.0).
           Rover v12 is at (1.0, -1.75). Distance approx sqrt((1.0 - (-1.9))^2 + (-1.75 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt(2.9^2 + 0.25^2) = sqrt(8.41 + 0.0625) = sqrt(8.4725) approx 2.9. This is within the max distance of 4.
           Rover v14 is at (-1.0, -1.75). Distance approx sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.9))^2 + (-1.75 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt(0.9^2 + 0.25^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 0.0625) = sqrt(0.8725) approx 0.93. This is well within range.
           
           Since the `imagevisible` predicates are given, we need to find appropriate configurations for `#o3`.
           Given `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, it means both rovers *can* see `v17` and `v18` from *some* configuration named `#o3`. It is likely that `#o3` is a specific location from which both `v17` and `v18` are visible.
           Let's assume `#o3` is a suitable position near `v17` and `v18` that is within 2 units, and can be reached from `v13` or `v15`.
           
           Let's reconsider the geometric positions given:
           v12 (rover) at (1.0, -1.75)
           v14 (rover) at (-1.0, -1.75)
           v17 (objective) at ((-0.444, 1.813), (-0.345, 1.912)) - average (-0.39, 1.86)
           v18 (objective) at ((-1.855, 2.042), (-1.784, 2.113)) - average (-1.82, 2.07)
           
           The `imagevisible` predicate is given for `#o3`. The distance from the rovers' initial positions to the objectives `v17` and `v18` is too far. Therefore, a movement to `#o3` is necessary. The problem states that if `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state and is used for `imagevisible` or `comvisible`, then we need to provide a continuous value. `#o3` is given with `conf(v14, #o3)` and `conf(v12, #o3)`.
           Let's find a point `p_img` such that `v17` and `v18` are within 2 units of `p_img`.
           Midpoint between `v17` and `v18`: ((-0.39 - 1.82)/2, (1.86 + 2.07)/2) = (-1.105, 1.965).
           Distance from (-1.105, 1.965) to `v17` (-0.39, 1.86): sqrt((-1.105 - (-0.39))^2 + (1.965 - 1.86)^2) = sqrt((-0.715)^2 + 0.105^2) = sqrt(0.511 + 0.011) = sqrt(0.522) approx 0.72. This is within 2.
           Distance from (-1.105, 1.965) to `v18` (-1.82, 2.07): sqrt((-1.105 - (-1.82))^2 + (1.965 - 2.07)^2) = sqrt(0.715^2 + (-0.105)^2) = sqrt(0.511 + 0.011) = sqrt(0.522) approx 0.72. This is also within 2.
           So, a good candidate for `#o3` is (-1.105, 1.965).
           
           Now for `#o0` (comms configuration):
           Lander `v9` is at (-1.9, -2.0).
           We need `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`.
           Both rovers can communicate from `#o0`. Let's pick a point close to `v9` but also reasonably close to where the rovers are.
           A point like `(-1.5, -2.0)` would be good for `#o0`.
           Distance from `(-1.5, -2.0)` to `v9` (-1.9, -2.0): sqrt((-1.5 - (-1.9))^2 + (-2.0 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt(0.4^2 + 0^2) = 0.4. This is within 4.
           
           For `#o5` (sampling configuration):
           We need `above(v14, #o5, v4)` and `above(v12, #o5, v8)`.
           `v4` (stone) at ((-1.028, -1.079), (-0.922, -0.973)) - average (-0.975, -1.026)
           `v8` (soil) at ((-1.999, -0.399), (-1.862, -0.261)) - average (-1.93, -0.33)
           These are two different locations. The problem says `above(v14, #o5, v7)`, `above(v12, #o5, v7)`, etc. for *all* rocks with the same `#o5`. This implies that `#o5` must be a position where both rovers can be *above* all the rocks. This is physically impossible if the rocks are spread out.
           
           However, the action instances only show `sample_rock v12 #o5 v1 v16`, `sample_rock v12 #o5 v3 v16`, etc. This suggests that `#o5` is a generic "sampling configuration" that works for various rocks, or that the planner should assume it is possible without having to find a single point `above` all of them. Since the goal is specific to `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, we need to pick *one* stone and *one* soil to analyze. Let's pick `v4` (stone) and `v8` (soil).
           It is more likely that `#o5` for `v4` is different from `#o5` for `v8`. The problem formulation with `above(v14, #o5, v7)`, `above(v14, #o5, v5)` etc., suggests that `#o5` is a single configuration. This is problematic with dispersed rocks.
           
           Given the input, it seems the continuous parameter `#o5` for `above` is assumed to be valid for whatever rock is specified in the `sample_rock` action.
           If the same `#o5` is used for both `v4` and `v8`, it's not geometrically possible for the robot to be above both at the same time if they are far apart.
           `v4`: average (-0.975, -1.026)
           `v8`: average (-1.93, -0.33)
           Let's assume the continuous parameter mechanism will find a suitable `#o5` for each specific `(rover, rock)` pair, even if it's named the same. The provided allowed actions use `#o5` for *all* sample rock actions. This is a bit ambiguous. I will proceed by assuming `#o5` is just a placeholder and the specific continuous values will be computed correctly for each (rover, rock) pair in the `sample_rock` action.
           
           The problem states "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration".
           This applies to `#o0` (comvisible) and `#o3` (imagevisible). It does not apply to `#o5` (above).
           
           So we need values for `#o0` and `#o3`.
           `#o3` (for imagevisible with v17 and v18): Let's use `(-1.105, 1.965)` for rover `v12` to see `v17`. We could also specify it for `v18`. Since `#o3` is used for `v17` and `v18` with the same ray `#o4`, it should be a position where both are visible. A common viewpoint is a good choice.
           `#o0` (for comvisible with v9): Let's use `(-1.5, -2.0)` for rover `v12` to communicate with `v9`.
           Let's confirm the choices for `#o0` and `#o3` regarding `v14` as well.
           `conf(v14, #o3)` and `conf(v14, #o0)` are also in the initial state. My plan uses `v12` for imaging and `v14` for sampling and their respective communication. Thus, values for `#o0` and `#o3` are needed for both rovers.
           For simplicity, let's assume `#o0` and `#o3` represent shared optimal locations for the respective tasks. This simplifies the continuous values as they are not specific to each rover, but to the task type. If the planner needs distinct configuration values for different rovers even if the parameter name is the same, this should be explicitly stated. "you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name." This implies if `#o0` is used for `v12` and `v9`, and also for `v14` and `v9`, it should be given distinct values. This is complex as it implies the same symbol `#o0` represents two different configurations. It is more likely that `#o0` and `#o3` are intended to be specific points in space. However, to comply with the instruction, if it's strictly interpreted that `#o0` for `v12` is different from `#o0` for `v14` *even if the value is the same*, I will specify it twice.
           
           Let's adjust `#o0` and `#o3` to be specific to the rover and its target, to be safe.
           For `v12` image: `#o3` to `v17` and `v18`. Let's pick a single position `(-1.105, 1.965)`.
           For `v12` comms: `#o0` to `v9`. Let's pick `(-1.5, -2.0)`.
           For `v14` comms: `#o0` to `v9`. Let's pick `(-1.5, -2.0)`. (Same value, but specified for v14 explicitly as per instructions).
           
           Let's assume default orientation (0.0) for the continuous configurations, unless an explicit rotation is critical for visibility/reachability which is not detailed in the problem.
           
           One final check on the plan:
           - Initial state: `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)`.
           - `new-axiom@0` conditions are all met by the end of the plan.
           
           Looks good.

Model:     The previous attempt failed because the chosen configurations were either unreachable or in collision. Let's re-evaluate the continuous parameters based on the feedback.
           
           **Reachable Configurations for Imaging (`#o3`):**
           The rover `v12` is initially at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           The targets `v17` (avg -0.39, 1.86) and `v18` (avg -1.82, 2.07) are in the upper-left quadrant.
           A configuration like `(-1.105, 1.965)` is far from `v12`'s initial position (distance > 3 units). Moving to this configuration might be too complex or long for `v12` if only `motion` predicates for small movements are given. However, there are `motion` predicates between `v13` and `#o3` (e.g., `(move v12 v13 #o2 #o3)` is an allowed action). If the motion is allowed, reachability is guaranteed by the `motion` predicate. The problem states "reachable from the rover's current configuration". So, the issue is not that the path doesn't exist, but perhaps the specific configuration calculated for `#o3` itself is problematic. Let's stick with `#o3` as the common image point and assume the `motion` predicates imply reachability. The previous error was "not reachable for robot base", this suggests the calculated coordinate might be outside the robot's operational area or otherwise geometrically invalid for the robot's base.
           
           Given that the configuration `(-1.105, 1.965, 0.0)` for `#o3` was deemed "not reachable for robot base", we need to find another one.
           Let's try to place `#o3` closer to the rovers' initial positions, if possible, while still being within range of `v17` and `v18` (max 2 units).
           `v17`: ((-0.444, 1.813), (-0.345, 1.912))
           `v18`: ((-1.855, 2.042), (-1.784, 2.113))
           It is impossible for *one* rover to be within 2 units of *both* `v17` and `v18` from a single point if `v17` and `v18` are 1.4 units apart, unless that point is very close to both.
           Distance between `v17` and `v18`: `sqrt((-0.39 - (-1.82))^2 + (1.86 - 2.07)^2)` = `sqrt(1.43^2 + (-0.21)^2)` = `sqrt(2.0449 + 0.0441)` = `sqrt(2.089)` approx 1.44 units.
           If a rover is at a point, it needs to be within a radius of 2 from `v17` and within a radius of 2 from `v18`. This means the point must be in the intersection of two circles of radius 2 centered at `v17` and `v18` respectively. This intersection exists.
           
           The previous `#o3` was `(-1.105, 1.965)`. This is the midpoint between the two. The distance to either target was ~0.72, which is well within 2. Why was it "not reachable for robot base"? This could indicate a general problem with configurations in that part of the map for the robot, or that the path itself involves collisions.
           
           Let's pick two *different* `#o3` configurations, one for `v17` and one for `v18`, even if the PDDL uses the same `#o3` symbol. This follows the rule of "a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair". This suggests `#o3` is a placeholder that needs specific instance values.
           Let's name them `#o3_v17` and `#o3_v18` for clarity in the configurations, but use `#o3` in the plan itself as per the allowed actions.
           
           For `v17` (avg -0.39, 1.86):
           Let's place `v12` at `(-0.39, 1.70)` (slightly below `v17`). Distance `sqrt(0^2 + (1.86-1.70)^2)` = 0.16. Within 2.
           
           For `v18` (avg -1.82, 2.07):
           Let's place `v12` at `(-1.82, 1.90)` (slightly below `v18`). Distance `sqrt(0^2 + (2.07-1.90)^2)` = 0.17. Within 2.
           
           This would require `v12` to move to `#o3_v17`, take image, then move to `#o3_v18`, take image.
           But the allowed actions specify `take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11` and `take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11`, implying a *single* `#o3` for both `v17` and `v18`.
           
           Let's check the current positions:
           `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75)
           `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)
           If `v14` is used for imaging, its starting point `(-1.0, -1.75)` is closer to the objectives `v17` and `v18` than `v12`'s starting point.
           From `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`:
           To `v17` `(-0.39, 1.86)`: `sqrt((-1.0 - (-0.39))^2 + (-1.75 - 1.86)^2)` = `sqrt((-0.61)^2 + (-3.61)^2)` = `sqrt(0.3721 + 13.0321)` = `sqrt(13.4042)` approx 3.66. Still too far.
           
           The problem implies that a suitable `#o3` exists for the given `imagevisible` predicates. The failure "not reachable for robot base" is critical. It implies that the *coordinate* `(-1.105, 1.965, 0.0)` is fundamentally problematic, not just its distance from the start. Let's try to slightly shift it, or perhaps the issue is the Z coordinate, or the orientation. The default Z is 0.0. A rover is usually on a plane. The orientation is also 0.0. Let's try keeping the same (x,y) but adjust orientation perhaps? No, orientation is not specified in the error. It explicitly says "for robot base", so it's about the (x,y) coordinate itself for the robot's center.
           
           Given the geometry of `v17` and `v18`, an (x,y) around `(-1.1, 1.9)` is the only way to be within 2m of both. If this location is unreachable, it's a critical problem.
           Let's consider the scenario where `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75) and `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           If the region `(-1.1, 1.9)` is unreachable by `v12`, it would probably be unreachable by `v14` as well.
           The problem statement gives `conf(v12, #o3)` and `conf(v14, #o3)`. It also provides `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)` and `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o3)`. These imply reachability.
           The only way for "not reachable for robot base" to make sense here is if *my calculated coordinate* for `#o3` is invalid.
           
           Let's try a different strategy. Instead of a single `#o3` for both `v17` and `v18`, maybe we should use one rover for `v17` and the other for `v18`.
           `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           The problem states `conf(v14, #o3)` and `conf(v12, #o3)` in the initial state. This strongly implies that `#o3` is a single valid continuous configuration. The error message is difficult to reconcile with the problem PDDL.
           
           Let's assume there is *some* valid coordinate for `#o3` that satisfies the imagevisible predicates for both `v17` and `v18` and is reachable for both `v12` and `v14`. I'll try to refine the previous coordinate `(-1.105, 1.965)`. Maybe the 'not reachable' refers to the combination of (x, y, theta) or simply that path is blocked. Without obstacle info for the motion path, it's hard to debug.
           Let's try to move `#o3` slightly so it's not the exact midpoint. `(-1.0, 1.9, 0.0)`. This point is still within range of both `v17` and `v18`. Let's test this value for `#o3`.
           
           **Collision for Communication (`#o0`):**
           My chosen `(-1.5, -2.0, 0.0)` was in collision with `v9` (lander).
           `v9` AABB: `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`
           The point `(-1.5, -2.0)` is *inside* the AABB of `v9` because -2.405 < -1.5 < -1.395 and -2.346 < -2.0 < -1.654. This is a clear collision.
           I need to pick a point *outside* of `v9`'s AABB, but still close enough for communication (max 4 units).
           Let's try `(-1.0, -2.0, 0.0)`.
           Distance to `v9` `(-1.9, -2.0)` is `sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.9))^2 + (-2.0 - (-2.0))^2)` = `sqrt(0.9^2 + 0^2)` = `0.9`. This is within 4.
           This point is to the right of `v9`. `(-1.0, -2.0)` is not in collision with `v9` because -1.0 is not between -2.405 and -1.395. It's to the right. So this should be a valid comms location.
           
           Updated configuration values:
           `#o3` (for imagevisible with v17 and v18): `(-1.0 1.9 0.0)`
           `#o0` (for comvisible with v9): `(-1.0 -2.0 0.0)`
           
           The plan remains the same.
           Let's ensure the `move` actions are between configurations for which `motion` predicates are provided.
           For `v12`: `v13` -> `#o3` -> `#o0`
           `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)` - exists.
           `motion(v12, #o3, #o2, #o0)` - exists.
           For `v14`: `v15` -> `#o5` -> `#o0` -> `#o5` -> `#o0`
           `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o5)` - exists.
           `motion(v14, #o5, #o2, #o0)` - exists.
           `motion(v14, #o0, #o2, #o5)` - exists.
           `motion(v14, #o5, #o2, #o0)` - exists.
           
           The plan appears robust given the updated configurations.

Configuration #o0 = (-1.0 -2.0 0.0) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The continuous configuration choices are proving to be challenging. The error messages indicate that the chosen (x, y, theta) coordinates for `#o0` and `#o3` are "not reachable for robot base", even though the `motion` predicates exist in the initial state. This suggests a more fundamental problem with *any* configuration in those general vicinities, or that the system has very specific constraints on where the robot base can be placed.
           
           Let's re-examine the given information:
           The problem implies that if `motion` predicates exist (e.g., `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)`), then a path exists. "reachable from the rover's current configuration" is a key instruction. If `motion` predicates imply reachability, then the chosen coordinates, if valid, should be reachable. The "not reachable for robot base" error could mean:
           1. The chosen (x,y) coordinates fall outside the valid terrain or operational bounds for the robot.
           2. The path to the chosen (x,y) from the current (x,y) is blocked by an unstated obstacle.
           3. The specific (x,y,theta) combo is invalid, perhaps the theta is incorrect, but the error only states "robot base", implying x,y.
           
           Given that *any* chosen point in the vicinity of the objectives or the lander for communication has been rejected as "not reachable", it might indicate that the problem expects us to use the configurations that *already exist* in the initial state and are not marked with `#`, if possible.
           
           Looking at the initial state:
           `atconf(v14, v15)` where `v15` is `(-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)`.
           `atconf(v12, v13)` where `v13` is `(1.0, -1.75, 3.142)`.
           These are fixed, known configurations. Could these be used for image capture or communication?
           
           **Image Capture:**
           `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`
           `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`
           `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           All `imagevisible` predicates require `#o3`. So we cannot use `v13` or `v15` directly for imaging unless there's an `imagevisible` predicate with those fixed configurations. There isn't. So `#o3` must be a dynamically calculated point.
           
           **Communication:**
           `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           All `comvisible` predicates require `#o0`. So we cannot use `v13` or `v15` directly for communication unless there's a `comvisible` predicate with those fixed configurations. There isn't. So `#o0` must also be a dynamically calculated point.
           
           This means we *must* provide configurations for `#o0` and `#o3`. The "not reachable for robot base" error is persistent for my choices. This implies that the environment is very constrained or my interpretation of "reachable" is too simplistic.
           
           Let's try to interpret "not reachable for robot base" more broadly. Perhaps the configuration for the *robot base* needs to be such that the *camera* (or comms antenna) can actually reach the target, and my (x,y,theta) is making it difficult. But the problem definition implies we provide (x,y) for the base, and then the ray is checked.
           
           The only way to proceed is to try coordinates that are extremely close to the targets or lander, but also possibly very close to one of the rovers' initial positions, to minimize potential "reachability" issues, assuming the `motion` predicates are valid for *some* path.
           
           **Re-evaluating `#o3` for imaging (targets `v17` and `v18`):**
           `v17` is at `((-0.444, 1.813), (-0.345, 1.912))`. Avg: `(-0.39, 1.86)`.
           `v18` is at `((-1.855, 2.042), (-1.784, 2.113))`. Avg: `(-1.82, 2.07)`.
           Rover `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. Rover `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           The image range is 2.0.
           A point like `(-0.4, 1.8)` is good for `v17`. A point like `(-1.8, 2.0)` is good for `v18`.
           These are far apart. The problem uses a single `#o3` for both `v17` and `v18`.
           This means `#o3` must be a point from which *both* `v17` and `v18` are visible within 2m.
           Let's try the midpoint again: `(-1.105, 1.965)`. This was rejected.
           What if the rover cannot go to a high Y coordinate? Perhaps there are boundaries. Without a map of obstacles/boundaries, it's difficult.
           
           Let's try to find a point that's close to one of the objectives, and assume the other objective can still be reached, or that the imagevisible predicate is highly permissive.
           Given `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`. Let's assume `v14` is used.
           `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           If `#o3` is `(-0.4, 1.8)` (close to `v17`), the distance to `v18` `(-1.8, 2.0)` is `sqrt((-0.4 - (-1.8))^2 + (1.8 - 2.0)^2)` = `sqrt(1.4^2 + (-0.2)^2)` = `sqrt(1.96 + 0.04)` = `sqrt(2.0)` approx 1.41. This is within 2m.
           So `(-0.4, 1.8, 0.0)` for `#o3` should work to see both `v17` and `v18`.
           This point is still "far" from `v14`'s start `(-1.0, -1.75)`. Distance: `sqrt((-1.0 - (-0.4))^2 + (-1.75 - 1.8)^2)` = `sqrt((-0.6)^2 + (-3.55)^2)` = `sqrt(0.36 + 12.6025)` = `sqrt(12.9625)` approx 3.6. Still a long move.
           But `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o3)` exists, so reachability should be asserted by this. The error "not reachable for robot base" is baffling then.
           Could it be that the *orientation* `theta = 0.0` is bad for reachability or collision? This is rarely the case for reachability of the base, unless the robot is very wide and turning in place causes collision.
           
           **Re-evaluating `#o0` for communication (target `v9`):**
           `v9` AABB: `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`. Lander's average center `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           My previous attempt `(-1.0, -2.0, 0.0)` was outside `v9`'s AABB, but also rejected as "not reachable for robot base".
           The communication range is 4.0.
           What if the rover should be directly south of `v9`? e.g., `(-1.9, -2.5)`.
           Distance to `v9` `(-1.9, -2.0)` is 0.5. Within 4.
           This point `(-1.9, -2.5)` is still in a similar y-range to the rovers' start points `(-1.75)`.
           Let's try `(-1.9, -2.5, 0.0)` for `#o0`. This is also close to `v14`'s starting X coordinate of -1.0.
           
           Given the persistent "not reachable for robot base" errors, perhaps the default orientation (0.0) is the problem for certain coordinates, or the system expects a different theta for reachability or visibility. If `motion` implies reachability of the `(x,y)` base, then the issue could be `theta`. However, the error message specifically stated "robot base", not "robot arm" or "camera".
           
           Let's stick with the plan structure. The issue is purely continuous parameter values.
           I will try to use the same rover for both imaging and sampling/analyzing if possible, to minimize movement. But the current setup suggests two rovers for two sets of tasks.
           I'll try again with the revised `#o3` and `#o0`. The plan logic remains sound.
           
           Revised coordinates for `#o3` (imaging for `v17`, `v18`): `(-0.4, 1.8, 0.0)`
           Revised coordinates for `#o0` (comms for `v9`): `(-1.9, -2.5, 0.0)`
           
           Let's use `v14` for imaging and communication. `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           Movement `v14` `v15` -> `#o3` (from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-0.4, 1.8)`). This is a substantial move.
           Movement `v14` `#o3` -> `#o0` (from `(-0.4, 1.8)` to `(-1.9, -2.5)`). This is also a substantial move.
           
           This is the best I can do without more information on the unreachable regions or specific motion constraints. It relies on the provided `motion` predicates to confirm reachability.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The problem of finding valid continuous configurations continues to be the main hurdle. The previous attempts resulted in collisions with existing objects in the environment, specifically `v19` and `v17` for imaging, and `v20` and `v9` for communication. This means my calculated (x,y) points are within the AABBs of these obstacles. This is critical information.
           
           Let's list the relevant obstacles and their AABBs:
           `v17` (objective): `((-0.444, 1.813), (-0.345, 1.912))`
           `v19` (obstacle): `((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))`
           `v9` (lander): `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`
           `v20` (obstacle): `((-2.55, -2.55), (2.55, -2.45))` (This looks like a long, thin horizontal obstacle at y=-2.5)
           
           **Re-evaluating `#o3` for imaging (targets `v17` and `v18`):**
           My last choice for `#o3` was `(-0.4, 1.8, 0.0)`.
           This collided with `v17` itself (which is an objective, but the robot base should not be *on* it) and `v19`.
           `v17` AABB contains `(-0.4, 1.8)`. So the base is on the objective. This is bad.
           `v19` AABB: `((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))`. `(-0.4, 1.8)` is also inside this obstacle.
           So, the imaging configuration needs to be *outside* of `v17`'s and `v19`'s AABBs, but still within 2m range of `v17` and `v18`.
           
           Let's try to place `#o3` to the right of `v17` and `v19`, and below `v17` and `v18`.
           `v17` is around x = -0.4, y = 1.8. `v19` covers x from -0.75 to -0.25 and y from 1.75 to 2.25.
           A point like `(0.0, 1.7)` for `#o3`.
           Distance to `v17` `(-0.39, 1.86)` from `(0.0, 1.7)`: `sqrt((-0.39 - 0.0)^2 + (1.86 - 1.7)^2)` = `sqrt((-0.39)^2 + (0.16)^2)` = `sqrt(0.1521 + 0.0256)` = `sqrt(0.1777)` approx 0.42. (Within 2m).
           Distance to `v18` `(-1.82, 2.07)` from `(0.0, 1.7)`: `sqrt((-1.82 - 0.0)^2 + (2.07 - 1.7)^2)` = `sqrt((-1.82)^2 + (0.37)^2)` = `sqrt(3.3124 + 0.1369)` = `sqrt(3.4493)` approx 1.86. (Within 2m).
           This point `(0.0, 1.7)` is outside `v17`'s AABB `((-0.444, 1.813), (-0.345, 1.912))` (0.0 is not in x range).
           This point `(0.0, 1.7)` is outside `v19`'s AABB `((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))` (0.0 is not in x range, 1.7 is not in y range).
           So, `#o3 = (0.0, 1.7, 0.0)` seems like a promising candidate.
           
           **Re-evaluating `#o0` for communication (target `v9`):**
           My last choice for `#o0` was `(-1.9, -2.5, 0.0)`.
           This collided with `v20` (`((-2.55, -2.55), (2.55, -2.45))`) and `v9` (`((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`).
           `(-1.9, -2.5)` is inside `v20`'s AABB (since -2.55 < -1.9 < 2.55 and -2.55 < -2.5 < -2.45). This is the horizontal bar.
           `(-1.9, -2.5)` is not inside `v9`'s AABB (y-coord -2.5 is below `v9`). But the error says it collided with `v9` too. Why? Perhaps the rover's own size makes it collide even if the center point is outside. Or the coordinates are slightly different in evaluation.
           The problem is that `v20` is a very wide obstacle at `y=-2.5`. This makes any configuration on `y=-2.5` problematic.
           
           We need to pick a point outside `v9` and `v20`, but within 4m of `v9` (avg `(-1.9, -2.0)`).
           Let's try a point directly above `v9`, or slightly to the right of `v9`.
           `v9` has a y_min of -2.346 and y_max of -1.654.
           `v20` has a y_min of -2.55 and y_max of -2.45.
           So, any y-coordinate between -2.346 and -1.654 is potentially in collision with `v9` (if x is also in range).
           Any y-coordinate between -2.55 and -2.45 is in collision with `v20`.
           So, we need a y-coordinate that is not in `[-2.55, -2.45]` AND not in `[-2.346, -1.654]`.
           Let's try `y = -1.0`.
           If `y = -1.0`, `x = -1.9` (same x as `v9`'s center).
           `(-1.9, -1.0)`.
           Distance from `(-1.9, -1.0)` to `v9` `(-1.9, -2.0)`: `sqrt(0^2 + (-1.0 - (-2.0))^2)` = `sqrt(0^2 + 1.0^2)` = `1.0`. (Within 4m).
           Is `(-1.9, -1.0)` in collision?
           Not with `v9` (y=-1.0 is not in [-2.346, -1.654]).
           Not with `v20` (y=-1.0 is not in [-2.55, -2.45]).
           This seems like a much safer bet for `#o0`. So, `#o0 = (-1.9, -1.0, 0.0)`.
           
           The plan order can remain the same. The split of tasks (v12 for sampling, v14 for imaging) is a reasonable choice to minimize movements between different functional areas.
           
           **Summary of new continuous values:**
           `#o3` (for imagevisible with v17 and v18): `(0.0 1.7 0.0)`
           `#o0` (for comvisible with v9): `(-1.9 -1.0 0.0)`
           
           Let's check the reachability from `v14` (at `v15`: `(-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)`) to `#o3`:
           `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(0.0, 1.7)`. Distance: `sqrt((0.0 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.7 - (-1.75))^2)` = `sqrt(1.0^2 + 3.45^2)` = `sqrt(1.0 + 11.9025)` = `sqrt(12.9025)` approx 3.59. This is still a long movement, but `motion` should handle it.
           
           From `v12` (at `v13`: `(1.0, -1.75, 3.142)`) to `#o0`:
           `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(-1.9, -1.0)`. Distance: `sqrt((-1.9 - 1.0)^2 + (-1.0 - (-1.75))^2)` = `sqrt((-2.9)^2 + (0.75)^2)` = `sqrt(8.41 + 0.5625)` = `sqrt(8.9725)` approx 2.99. This is also a long movement.
           
           Given the `motion` predicates in the initial state connecting these configuration types, the "not reachable" error should not apply if the continuous parameters themselves are valid and collision-free. These new choices are explicitly placed to avoid the previously identified collisions.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The persistent issues with continuous configurations indicate that the environment is highly constrained with unseen obstacles, or the interpretation of "reachable" and "collision-free" is very strict.
           
           Let's re-examine the collision for `#o3 = (0.0 1.7 0.0)`:
           It collided with `v21: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1))`.
           This is a very thin, long vertical obstacle along the y-axis, centered at x=0.0. My chosen x=0.0 falls directly on this obstacle. This is a clear collision.
           
           **Re-evaluating `#o3` for imaging (targets `v17` and `v18`):**
           `v17` is around `(-0.39, 1.86)`. `v18` is around `(-1.82, 2.07)`.
           `v19` AABB: `((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))`
           `v21` AABB: `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))` (thin vertical wall at x=0)
           
           I need a point that is:
           1. Within 2m of `v17` and `v18`.
           2. Outside `v17`, `v19`, `v21` AABBs.
           
           Let's try to place `#o3` to the right of `v21` (so x > 0.05).
           And also away from `v19` and `v17`.
           How about `(0.2, 1.7, 0.0)` for `#o3`?
           Check collision:
           - Not in `v21` (`x=0.2` is outside `(-0.05, 0.05)`).
           - Not in `v17` (`x=0.2` is outside `(-0.444, -0.345)`).
           - Not in `v19` (`x=0.2` is outside `(-0.75, -0.25)`).
           
           Check range:
           Distance to `v17` `(-0.39, 1.86)` from `(0.2, 1.7)`: `sqrt((-0.39 - 0.2)^2 + (1.86 - 1.7)^2)` = `sqrt((-0.59)^2 + (0.16)^2)` = `sqrt(0.3481 + 0.0256)` = `sqrt(0.3737)` approx 0.61. (Within 2m).
           Distance to `v18` `(-1.82, 2.07)` from `(0.2, 1.7)`: `sqrt((-1.82 - 0.2)^2 + (2.07 - 1.7)^2)` = `sqrt((-2.02)^2 + (0.37)^2)` = `sqrt(4.0804 + 0.1369)` = `sqrt(4.2173)` approx 2.05. This is *just over* 2m. This won't work.
           
           This is very tricky. The common visibility point is hard to find.
           What if `v12` images `v17` and `v14` images `v18`? The problem PDDL uses `#o3` for both, suggesting a single configuration or that `#o3` is a type of configuration that is resolved by the planner as different locations. The "different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair" rule implies `#o3` needs to resolve to a distinct `(x,y,theta)` for `v12, v17` vs `v14, v18`.
           
           Let's assume `#o3` is a specific location from which *both* `v17` and `v18` are visible.
           The distance between `v17` and `v18` is `~1.44m`. If a point is `d1` from `v17` and `d2` from `v18`, then `d1+d2 >= 1.44`. With `d1, d2 <= 2`, this is possible.
           The intersection of two circles (radius 2) centered at `v17` and `v18`.
           `v17` `(-0.39, 1.86)`. `v18` `(-1.82, 2.07)`.
           Obstacles: `v19` `((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))`, `v21` `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`.
           The intersection region is mostly between `v17` and `v18`. This region is heavily obstructed by `v19` and `v21` (since `v19` is between x=-0.75 and -0.25, and `v21` is at x=0).
           
           It seems extremely difficult to find a single `#o3` given the obstacles and range constraint.
           Perhaps I should rethink the strategy of using `v14` for both `v17` and `v18` imaging from a single `#o3`.
           What if `v14` images `v17` from one `#o3` (value `P1`), and `v12` images `v18` from another `#o3` (value `P2`)? This would violate the action instances, which reuse `#o3` for multiple objective/rover pairs. The problem asks for a single configuration name, like `#o3`, and then my output assigns *values* to it based on (rover, target) pairs.
           
           Let's assume the problem intends for `#o3` to be a *single* point that works for both `v17` and `v18`, and for both `v12` and `v14`. This single point must avoid `v17`, `v19`, `v21`.
           We need x < -0.75 OR x > -0.25 OR y < 1.75 OR y > 2.25 (for `v19`).
           And x < -0.444 OR x > -0.345 OR y < 1.813 OR y > 1.912 (for `v17`).
           And x < -0.05 OR x > 0.05 (for `v21`).
           
           Let's try a point `(0.1, 1.5, 0.0)` for `#o3`.
           - `v21` collision: `x=0.1` is > `0.05`, so ok.
           - `v17` collision: `x=0.1` is > `-0.345`, so ok.
           - `v19` collision: `x=0.1` is > `-0.25`, so ok.
           - Range to `v17` `(-0.39, 1.86)`: `sqrt((-0.39 - 0.1)^2 + (1.86 - 1.5)^2)` = `sqrt((-0.49)^2 + (0.36)^2)` = `sqrt(0.2401 + 0.1296)` = `sqrt(0.3697)` approx 0.61. (Within 2m).
           - Range to `v18` `(-1.82, 2.07)`: `sqrt((-1.82 - 0.1)^2 + (2.07 - 1.5)^2)` = `sqrt((-1.92)^2 + (0.57)^2)` = `sqrt(3.6864 + 0.3249)` = `sqrt(4.0113)` approx 2.002. This is just over 2m. Still fails.
           
           It appears extremely difficult to find a single `#o3` location for `v17` and `v18`.
           If the PDDL actions are fixed to `imagevisible(v_any, #o3, #o4, o_any, c_any, m_any)`, it implies that `#o3` must be able to serve multiple targets.
           
           Maybe the solution is to use *different* configuration names for imagevisible? No, the action instances only allow `#o3`.
           Given the fixed object locations and ranges, a single point visible for both targets might not exist without collision. This could mean the goal is unreachable.
           However, I must assume the problem is solvable. What else could `#o3` imply? The configuration for the camera, not the base? No, it's `conf(v_rover, #o3)`.
           
           Perhaps the obstacles in the AABB list are not exhaustive, and there are other large invisible obstacles.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the collision for `#o0 = (-1.9 -1.0 0.0)` for communication.
           It was rejected as "not reachable for robot base". No collision, just not reachable.
           `v9` AABB: `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`. Lander `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           `v20` AABB: `((-2.55, -2.55), (2.55, -2.45))`.
           My chosen `(-1.9, -1.0)` is above both of these obstacles.
           Why is it "not reachable"?
           Could the robot simply not be allowed to go to negative y coordinates? Both rovers start at y=-1.75. `#o0` at y=-1.0 is a positive y change for `v12` (from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(-1.9, -1.0)`). For `v14` (from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-1.9, -1.0)`).
           The `motion` predicates in the initial state exist. The planner *should* be able to find a path.
           
           What if I pick a configuration *near* the starting positions of the rovers for communication?
           `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. `v9` is at `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           Distance from `v14`'s start to `v9`: `sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.9))^2 + (-1.75 - (-2.0))^2)` = `sqrt(0.9^2 + 0.25^2)` = `sqrt(0.81 + 0.0625)` = `sqrt(0.8725)` approx 0.93. This is within 4m range.
           So, `v14` can communicate from its starting position `v15`!
           `comvisible(v14, v15, #o1, v9)`: This predicate does not exist. Only `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` exists.
           This means I am *forced* to use `#o0` even if `v15` works.
           
           This is extremely difficult without more explicit information on the environment or a simulator that can evaluate points more accurately. If the `motion` predicates imply reachability for *any* valid configuration, then the "not reachable" error should not happen. It implies my provided coordinate itself is not valid for the robot base, possibly due to terrain.
           
           Let's try a very different approach for `#o0` and `#o3`.
           For `#o3` (imaging `v17`, `v18`), let's try a point in the vicinity of `v14`'s starting position, `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           From `(-1.0, -1.75)`:
           Distance to `v17` `(-0.39, 1.86)` is `3.66m` (too far).
           Distance to `v18` `(-1.82, 2.07)` is `3.82m` (too far).
           This confirms that imaging needs a move to the upper-left quadrant. This region seems problematic.
           
           Let's consider the problem statement: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value..."
           This means `#o0` and `#o3` *must* be given values.
           
           Let's try to put `#o3` as close as possible to the objectives without collision, avoiding the obstacles `v17`, `v19`, `v21`.
           `v17` (obj) `(-0.4, 1.8)`. `v19` (obs) `((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))`. `v21` (wall) `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`.
           To be visible for `v17` and `v18`, the point `P` must satisfy `dist(P, v17) <= 2` and `dist(P, v18) <= 2`.
           To avoid `v19`: `P.x < -0.75` or `P.x > -0.25` or `P.y < 1.75` or `P.y > 2.25`.
           To avoid `v21`: `P.x < -0.05` or `P.x > 0.05`.
           To avoid `v17`: `P` is not inside `v17` AABB.
           
           Let's try `P = (0.1, 2.0)`.
           - Collision check:
             - `v21`: `x=0.1` is `>0.05`, so ok.
             - `v17`: `x=0.1` is `>-0.345`, so ok.
             - `v19`: `x=0.1` is `>-0.25`, so ok. (y=2.0 is in range 1.75-2.25 for v19, but x is not.)
           - Range check:
             - To `v17` `(-0.39, 1.86)` from `(0.1, 2.0)`: `sqrt((-0.39 - 0.1)^2 + (1.86 - 2.0)^2)` = `sqrt((-0.49)^2 + (-0.14)^2)` = `sqrt(0.2401 + 0.0196)` = `sqrt(0.2597)` approx 0.51. (Within 2m).
             - To `v18` `(-1.82, 2.07)` from `(0.1, 2.0)`: `sqrt((-1.82 - 0.1)^2 + (2.07 - 2.0)^2)` = `sqrt((-1.92)^2 + (0.07)^2)` = `sqrt(3.6864 + 0.0049)` = `sqrt(3.6913)` approx 1.92. (Within 2m).
           This point `(0.1, 2.0, 0.0)` for `#o3` seems good for both collision and range.
           
           For `#o0` (comms to `v9` `(-1.9, -2.0)`):
           `v9` AABB: `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
           `v20` AABB: `((-2.55, -2.55), (2.55, -2.45))`.
           `v21` AABB: `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`.
           
           Previous `#o0 = (-1.9, -1.0, 0.0)` was "not reachable".
           This location is above the `v9` and `v20` obstacles. It is also away from `v21`.
           It is hard to understand why it is "not reachable". Perhaps the rover cannot turn effectively there.
           Let's try a point directly to the right of `v9`.
           `v9` `xmax = -1.395`. So x-coordinate > -1.395.
           Let `P = (-1.3, -2.0)`.
           - Collision check:
             - `v9`: `x=-1.3` is not in `(-2.405, -1.395)`. Ok. `y=-2.0` is in range.
             - `v20`: `y=-2.0` is not in `(-2.55, -2.45)`. Ok.
             - `v21`: `x=-1.3` is not in `(-0.05, 0.05)`. Ok.
           - Range check:
             - To `v9` `(-1.9, -2.0)` from `(-1.3, -2.0)`: `sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.3))^2 + (-2.0 - (-2.0))^2)` = `sqrt((-0.6)^2 + 0^2)` = `0.6`. (Within 4m).
           This point `(-1.3, -2.0, 0.0)` for `#o0` seems good.
           
           Let's use the same plan structure.
           
           --Plan--:

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The continuous parameter problem continues. The last attempt also resulted in collisions. This is extremely challenging without a full map of the environment. Each iteration reveals new obstacles or specific conditions that make the chosen coordinates invalid.
           
           Let's list all new and old obstacle AABBs relevant to `#o3` and `#o0`:
           
           **Obstacles for Imaging (`#o3`):**
           `v17` (objective): `((-0.444, 1.813), (-0.345, 1.912))`
           `v19` (obstacle): `((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))`
           `v21` (obstacle): `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))` (vertical wall at x=0)
           `v22` (obstacle): `((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))` (new obstacle)
           
           My previous `#o3` was `(0.1, 2.0, 0.0)`.
           Collision with `v21`: `x=0.1` is not between `(-0.05, 0.05)`. So the collision with `v21` is incorrect based on my AABB check. This implies the collision checker is either using a different range or a non-AABB shape for `v21`, or my `x` value is being truncated/rounded.
           Collision with `v22`: `x=0.1` is not between `(0.25, 0.75)`. This means `v22` wasn't what `0.1` collided with.
           
           This is very confusing. Let's strictly re-verify my calculations, assuming the reported AABBs are correct and standard AABB collision applies.
           For `(0.1, 2.0)`:
           - `v21 ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`: Is `0.1` between `-0.05` and `0.05`? No. So no collision with `v21`.
           - `v22 ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))`: Is `0.1` between `0.25` and `0.75`? No. So no collision with `v22`.
           
           This suggests there is an unlisted obstacle, or a very specific definition of collision that I'm missing.
           Given that the checker reports collision for `x=0.1` with `v21`, it must mean `0.1` *is* considered within `(-0.05, 0.05)` (e.g., due to tolerance, or the actual shape being wider than AABB). If `x=0.1` is in `v21`, then the `v21` AABB is effectively wider, or the rover base itself has a width that overlaps.
           
           Let's assume the collision check is *correct* and my understanding of the AABB rules for `v21` is flawed in this system. If `x=0.1` collides with `v21`, then `x` must be much further from `0.0`.
           This implies `#o3` must be `x < -0.05` (e.g., `x=-0.1`) or `x > 0.05` (e.g., `x=0.15` and my `0.1` was somehow problematic).
           
           Let's try to place `#o3` far enough from `x=0.0`.
           If `x=0.1` is bad, let's try `x=0.8`.
           For `#o3 = (0.8, 2.0, 0.0)`:
           - Collision with `v22 ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))`: `x=0.8` is `>0.75`, so outside. `y=2.0` is `in (1.75, 2.25)`. No, `x=0.8` is *outside* the `v22` AABB.
           - Collision with `v21`: `x=0.8` is outside.
           - Collision with `v17`: `x=0.8` is outside.
           - Collision with `v19`: `x=0.8` is outside.
           
           So `(0.8, 2.0, 0.0)` seems clear of obstacles.
           Now, check range for `(0.8, 2.0)`:
           - To `v17` `(-0.39, 1.86)`: `sqrt((-0.39 - 0.8)^2 + (1.86 - 2.0)^2)` = `sqrt((-1.19)^2 + (-0.14)^2)` = `sqrt(1.4161 + 0.0196)` = `sqrt(1.4357)` approx 1.19. (Within 2m).
           - To `v18` `(-1.82, 2.07)`: `sqrt((-1.82 - 0.8)^2 + (2.07 - 2.0)^2)` = `sqrt((-2.62)^2 + (0.07)^2)` = `sqrt(6.8644 + 0.0049)` = `sqrt(6.8693)` approx 2.62. This is **over 2m**. This point fails.
           
           This is making me think a single `#o3` for both targets might be impossible.
           If `v17` `(-0.39, 1.86)` and `v18` `(-1.82, 2.07)` are targets, and `v21` at `x=0` and `v19` around `x=-0.5` are obstacles, the intersection area is incredibly small.
           Let's try to place `#o3` at `(-0.1, 2.0, 0.0)`.
           - Collision check:
             - `v21`: `x=-0.1` is not in `(-0.05, 0.05)`. Should be OK.
             - `v17`: `x=-0.1` is not in `(-0.444, -0.345)`. Should be OK.
             - `v19`: `x=-0.1` is not in `(-0.75, -0.25)`. Should be OK.
             - `v22`: `x=-0.1` is not in `(0.25, 0.75)`. Should be OK.
           - Range check for `(-0.1, 2.0)`:
             - To `v17` `(-0.39, 1.86)`: `sqrt((-0.39 - (-0.1))^2 + (1.86 - 2.0)^2)` = `sqrt((-0.29)^2 + (-0.14)^2)` = `sqrt(0.0841 + 0.0196)` = `sqrt(0.1037)` approx 0.32. (Within 2m).
             - To `v18` `(-1.82, 2.07)`: `sqrt((-1.82 - (-0.1))^2 + (2.07 - 2.0)^2)` = `sqrt((-1.72)^2 + (0.07)^2)` = `sqrt(2.9584 + 0.0049)` = `sqrt(2.9633)` approx 1.72. (Within 2m).
           This point `(-0.1, 2.0, 0.0)` seems like a strong candidate for `#o3`.
           
           **Obstacles for Communication (`#o0`):**
           `v9` (lander): `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`
           `v20` (obstacle): `((-2.55, -2.55), (2.55, -2.45))`
           `v21` (obstacle): `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`
           
           My previous `#o0` was `(-1.3, -2.0, 0.0)`.
           Collision with `v9`: `x=-1.3` is NOT between `(-2.405, -1.395)`. It's outside (to the right). `y=-2.0` IS between `(-2.346, -1.654)`.
           This means `v9`'s AABB is `x in [-2.405, -1.395]` AND `y in [-2.346, -1.654]`.
           `x=-1.3` is outside the x-range of `v9`. So, no collision with `v9`.
           
           This is incredibly frustrating, as the error messages contradict a direct interpretation of AABB rules. The only explanation is that the robot has a non-negligible size, and my coordinates represent its center, so it collides when its *extents* overlap, not just its center. Or, there are more invisible obstacles.
           If `(-1.3, -2.0)` collides with `v9`, it must be because the robot's width/height or some buffer makes it collide when `x=-1.3` is near `v9`'s `xmax = -1.395`.
           
           Let's try to place `#o0` further away from `v9` and `v20`.
           `v9` `xmax = -1.395`. `v20` covers y `[-2.55, -2.45]`.
           We need `x > -1.395` (to be right of `v9`) and `y` not in `[-2.55, -2.45]` and `y` not in `[-2.346, -1.654]`.
           Let `y = -1.5`. And `x = -1.3`.
           For `#o0 = (-1.3, -1.5, 0.0)`:
           - Collision Check:
             - `v9`: `x=-1.3` is not in `(-2.405, -1.395)`. `y=-1.5` is not in `(-2.346, -1.654)`. Ok.
             - `v20`: `y=-1.5` is not in `(-2.55, -2.45)`. Ok.
             - `v21`: `x=-1.3` is not in `(-0.05, 0.05)`. Ok.
           - Range Check to `v9` `(-1.9, -2.0)`:
             - From `(-1.3, -1.5)`: `sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.3))^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.5))^2)` = `sqrt((-0.6)^2 + (-0.5)^2)` = `sqrt(0.36 + 0.25)` = `sqrt(0.61)` approx 0.78. (Within 4m).
           This point `(-1.3, -1.5, 0.0)` seems like a good candidate for `#o0`.
           
           Let's re-verify the plan itself one last time. It seems logically sound. The main problem is the precise choice of continuous values.
           
           New Continuous Values:
           `#o3` (for imagevisible with v17 and v18): `(-0.1 2.0 0.0)`
           `#o0` (for comvisible with v9): `(-1.3 -1.5 0.0)`

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The continuous configuration problem is proving to be extremely difficult, with continuous "collision" and "not reachable" errors even when the calculated points seem to logically avoid the AABBs. This suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of the collision detection or reachability rules, or that the AABBs are not fully descriptive of the robot's environment and obstacles.
           
           Let's re-analyze the collision reports for the latest attempt:
           
           **For `#o3 = (-0.1, 2.0, 0.0)`:**
           Collided with `v21: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1))`
           Collided with `v19: AABB(lower=(-0.75, 1.75, 0.0), upper=(-0.25, 2.25, 0.1))`
           
           My coordinates `(-0.1, 2.0)`.
           - For `v21`: x is in `(-0.05, 0.05)`. `x=-0.1` is *not* in this range.
           - For `v19`: x is in `(-0.75, -0.25)`. `x=-0.1` is *not* in this range.
           
           The problem statement said "Any object that starts with a '#' represents a *continuous parameter*". And "You will then generate a list of actions that achieve the goal. It is critical that the preconditions of each action are satisfied after the previous action is executed, and that actions are collision-free. ... If your plan uses some object #<name> ... you must provide a continuous value... such that... collision-free for the rover, reachable... and has occlusion-free line-of-sight..."
           
           This indicates that my interpretation of the AABBs might be too literal (e.g., perhaps the robot has a width/radius, or the AABBs have a buffer zone). Given the repeated pattern of "collision" and "not reachable", and the apparent contradiction with direct AABB calculation, it's highly probable that my calculated coordinates are always slightly off or inside a hidden buffer.
           
           Let's try to infer a "safe zone" from the repeated failures.
           For imaging targets `v17` and `v18`, the relevant obstacles are `v17`, `v19`, `v21`, `v22`.
           `v17` `(-0.444, 1.813)` to `(-0.345, 1.912)`
           `v19` `(-0.75, 1.75)` to `(-0.25, 2.25)`
           `v21` `(-0.05, -2.5)` to `(0.05, 2.5)` (vertical wall at x=0)
           `v22` `(0.25, 1.75)` to `(0.75, 2.25)`
           
           My last point `(-0.1, 2.0)` conflicted with `v21` and `v19`.
           This implies `x = -0.1` is considered within `v21` `(-0.05, 0.05)` and `v19` `(-0.75, -0.25)`. This implies a significant buffer or widening effect, making these obstacles *much* larger.
           
           If `(-0.1, 2.0)` collides with `v21` (x=0.0 wall) and `v19` (x-range `(-0.75, -0.25)`), then it means `x=-0.1` is simultaneously near `x=0` and in the range `(-0.75, -0.25)`. This is very hard to reconcile.
           
           The only remaining option is to place `#o3` so far from all listed obstacles, that it satisfies the conditions, even if it feels geometrically awkward.
           Let's try `x = 1.0` for `#o3`. This puts it to the right of `v21` and `v22`.
           For `#o3 = (1.0, 2.0, 0.0)`:
           - Collision Check:
             - `v21 (x=0)`: `x=1.0` is outside. OK.
             - `v19 (x=-0.75 to -0.25)`: `x=1.0` is outside. OK.
             - `v17 (x=-0.444 to -0.345)`: `x=1.0` is outside. OK.
             - `v22 (x=0.25 to 0.75)`: `x=1.0` is outside. OK.
           - Range Check (distance to `(1.0, 2.0)`):
             - To `v17` `(-0.39, 1.86)`: `sqrt((-0.39 - 1.0)^2 + (1.86 - 2.0)^2)` = `sqrt((-1.39)^2 + (-0.14)^2)` = `sqrt(1.9321 + 0.0196)` = `sqrt(1.9517)` approx 1.39. (Within 2m).
             - To `v18` `(-1.82, 2.07)`: `sqrt((-1.82 - 1.0)^2 + (2.07 - 2.0)^2)` = `sqrt((-2.82)^2 + (0.07)^2)` = `sqrt(7.9524 + 0.0049)` = `sqrt(7.9573)` approx 2.82. This is **over 2m**. This point fails.
           
           This means it is geometrically impossible to find a *single* point `#o3` that is within 2m of *both* `v17` and `v18` AND avoids the known obstacles. The distance between `v17` and `v18` is ~1.44m. The obstacles `v19` and `v21` effectively block the area between them and to their left. The area to their right, like `(1.0, 2.0)`, is too far from `v18`.
           
           If it is truly impossible to find a single valid `#o3` configuration, then the goal `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)` *cannot* both be achieved by a single `imagevisible(rover, #o3, ...)` setup. This would mean the goal is unreachable.
           However, I must assume the goal is achievable. Could it be that `#o3` can be two different *values* when referred to as `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`? "a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair". This suggests that for `(v14, v17)`, I can have one `#o3` value, and for `(v14, v18)`, I can have another `#o3` value, *even if the plan uses `#o3` for both*.
           
           Let's try this interpretation. We'll specify two distinct `(x,y,theta)` for `#o3` in the configurations list, one for each target object. The plan remains the same, but the underlying values are different.
           
           **Separate `#o3` values:**
           - For `v17` `(-0.39, 1.86)`: Place `#o3_v17` at `(0.1, 1.9, 0.0)`.
             - Collision Check:
               - `v21`: `x=0.1` outside `(-0.05, 0.05)`. OK.
               - `v19`: `x=0.1` outside `(-0.75, -0.25)`. OK.
               - `v17`: `x=0.1` outside `(-0.444, -0.345)`. OK.
               - `v22`: `x=0.1` outside `(0.25, 0.75)`. OK.
             - Range Check for `(0.1, 1.9)` to `v17` `(-0.39, 1.86)`: `sqrt((-0.39 - 0.1)^2 + (1.86 - 1.9)^2)` = `sqrt((-0.49)^2 + (-0.04)^2)` = `sqrt(0.2401 + 0.0016)` = `sqrt(0.2417)` approx 0.49. (Within 2m).
           
           - For `v18` `(-1.82, 2.07)`: Place `#o3_v18` at `(-1.8, 1.9, 0.0)`.
             - Collision Check:
               - `v21`: `x=-1.8` outside `(-0.05, 0.05)`. OK.
               - `v19`: `x=-1.8` outside `(-0.75, -0.25)`. OK.
               - `v17`: `x=-1.8` outside `(-0.444, -0.345)`. OK.
               - `v22`: `x=-1.8` outside `(0.25, 0.75)`. OK.
             - Range Check for `(-1.8, 1.9)` to `v18` `(-1.82, 2.07)`: `sqrt((-1.82 - (-1.8))^2 + (2.07 - 1.9)^2)` = `sqrt((-0.02)^2 + (0.17)^2)` = `sqrt(0.0004 + 0.0289)` = `sqrt(0.0293)` approx 0.17. (Within 2m).
           
           This strategy provides two distinct, collision-free, and in-range points for imaging `v17` and `v18` respectively. The `move` action would take the rover to the correct `#o3` value at each step.
           
           **For `#o0 = (-1.3, -1.5, 0.0)`:**
           Still "not reachable for robot base". My interpretation of "collision" vs "not reachable" might be incorrect, or the definition of the environment is very sparse.
           `v9` AABB: `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`
           `v20` AABB: `((-2.55, -2.55), (2.55, -2.45))`
           `v21` AABB: `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`
           
           Let's try moving `#o0` even further away from `v9` along the positive x-axis.
           How about `(-0.5, -2.0, 0.0)`?
           - Collision Check:
             - `v9`: `x=-0.5` is outside `(-2.405, -1.395)`. Ok. `y=-2.0` is in range.
             - `v20`: `y=-2.0` is not in `(-2.55, -2.45)`. Ok.
             - `v21`: `x=-0.5` is not in `(-0.05, 0.05)`. Ok.
           - Range Check to `v9` `(-1.9, -2.0)` from `(-0.5, -2.0)`: `sqrt((-1.9 - (-0.5))^2 + (-2.0 - (-2.0))^2)` = `sqrt((-1.4)^2 + 0^2)` = `1.4`. (Within 4m).
           This `(-0.5, -2.0, 0.0)` seems like a good candidate for `#o0`. It's further to the right than `v9`, so shouldn't collide with it. It's not on the `v20` bar. And it's away from `v21`.
           
           This strategy of using distinct values for the same named continuous parameter, and being very cautious with coordinates, is my best bet.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The continuous configuration problem is proving to be extremely difficult. Despite detailed AABB checks and careful selection of points, collisions and "not reachable" errors persist. This indicates that the environment might have unlisted obstacles, or the collision detection model (including robot size/shape) and reachability constraints are more complex than simple point-in-AABB checks. The problem states "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is *false*," implying all obstacles are listed. This leads me to believe the issue is related to the effective size of the robot, or hidden environmental boundaries/terrain issues.
           
           Let's re-examine the latest collision reports:
           
           **For `#o3` (v14 at v17) = `(0.1, 1.9, 0.0)`:**
           Collided with `v21: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1))`
           Collided with `v22: AABB(lower=(0.25, 1.75, 0.0), upper=(0.75, 2.25, 0.1))`
           My point `(0.1, 1.9)` has x=`0.1`.
           - `v21` (x from -0.05 to 0.05): `0.1` is outside.
           - `v22` (x from 0.25 to 0.75): `0.1` is outside.
           This is a direct contradiction. The collision checker must be implicitly expanding the AABBs or using a different collision geometry for the robot. If `x=0.1` hits `v21`, it means `v21` (the "wall" at `x=0`) is effectively wider than `0.05`. If it hits `v22`, it means `v22` starts at `x <= 0.1`.
           
           **For `#o3` (v14 at v18) = `(-1.8, 1.9, 0.0)`:**
           Collided with `v23: AABB(lower=(-2.25, 1.75, 0.0), upper=(-1.75, 2.25, 0.1))` (new obstacle)
           Collided with `v18: AABB(lower=(-1.855, 2.042), upper=(-1.784, 2.113))` (objective itself)
           My point `(-1.8, 1.9)`.
           - `v23` (x from -2.25 to -1.75): `x=-1.8` is *inside* this range. So this collision is valid given `v23`.
           - `v18`: `x=-1.8` is *inside* `(-1.855, -1.784)`. So robot base is on the objective. This is also a valid collision.
           
           This means my strategy of placing the rover close to the target, or in the midpoint, is failing due to previously unlisted obstacles (`v23`) or the rover colliding with the targets themselves (which makes sense, rover base shouldn't be on the target).
           
           **For `#o0 = (-0.5, -2.0, 0.0)`:**
           "Not reachable for robot base." No collision reported, just reachability.
           This point is outside `v9`, `v20`, `v21` and `v23`.
           
           This suggests that the "not reachable" errors are not due to collisions with *listed* AABBs, but possibly due to:
           1. Implicit boundaries of the environment (e.g., a map where the robot cannot physically go beyond certain (x,y) limits).
           2. Complex pathfinding issues (e.g., even if the target is clear, the path from the start might be blocked by *other* geometry not at the target, or the path requires complex maneuvers that are too costly).
           3. Robot base size considerations, where the AABB point is clear but the robot itself is not.
           
           Given the constraints, I will try to use a strategy that is *very* conservative in placing the continuous configurations, moving them significantly away from *any* known AABB boundaries.
           
           **New Strategy for `#o3` (Imaging):**
           Targets: `v17` `(-0.39, 1.86)`, `v18` `(-1.82, 2.07)`.
           Obstacles:
           `v17` (obj): `((-0.444, 1.813), (-0.345, 1.912))`
           `v18` (obj): `((-1.855, 2.042), (-1.784, 2.113))`
           `v19` (obs): `((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))`
           `v21` (obs): `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`
           `v22` (obs): `((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))`
           `v23` (obs): `((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25))`
           
           This is a heavily obstructed area.
           Let's try to find a point that's:
           1. Clear of all X/Y ranges of obstacles.
           2. Still within 2m range of *either* `v17` or `v18` (since I'm using separate values for `#o3`).
           
           For `v17` (`(-0.39, 1.86)`): I need to be in the vicinity.
           All obstacles are within `x in [-2.25, 0.75]` and `y in [1.75, 2.25]` (ignoring `v21`'s y-range for now).
           Let's try to place `#o3_v17` far to the right, e.g., `(1.0, 1.0, 0.0)`.
           - Collision check: `x=1.0` is clear of all obstacle x-ranges. OK.
           - Range check to `v17` `(-0.39, 1.86)` from `(1.0, 1.0)`: `sqrt((-0.39 - 1.0)^2 + (1.86 - 1.0)^2)` = `sqrt((-1.39)^2 + (0.86)^2)` = `sqrt(1.9321 + 0.7396)` = `sqrt(2.6717)` approx 1.63. (Within 2m). OK.
           
           For `v18` (`(-1.82, 2.07)`):
           Let's try far to the left, e.g., `(-2.5, 1.0, 0.0)`.
           - Collision check: `x=-2.5` is not inside `v17, v18, v19, v21, v22, v23` x-ranges. OK.
           - Range check to `v18` `(-1.82, 2.07)` from `(-2.5, 1.0)`: `sqrt((-1.82 - (-2.5))^2 + (2.07 - 1.0)^2)` = `sqrt((0.68)^2 + (1.07)^2)` = `sqrt(0.4624 + 1.1449)` = `sqrt(1.6073)` approx 1.26. (Within 2m). OK.
           
           **New Strategy for `#o0` (Communication):**
           Target: `v9` `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           Obstacles:
           `v9` (lander): `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`
           `v20` (obs): `((-2.55, -2.55), (2.55, -2.45))`
           `v21` (obs): `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`
           
           Previous `#o0 = (-0.5, -2.0, 0.0)` was "not reachable".
           This was located to the right of `v9`. It avoided `v9`, `v20`, `v21`.
           "Not reachable" implies there's a barrier or out-of-bounds area. Given `v20` is a horizontal bar at y=-2.5, and `v9` is at y in `[-2.346, -1.654]`, the area around y=-2.0 could be a problem zone.
           
           Let's try to place `#o0` considerably above `v9` and `v20`.
           How about `(-1.9, 0.0, 0.0)` (same X as `v9` center, but much higher Y).
           - Collision check:
             - `v9`: `y=0.0` is clear of `v9`'s y-range. OK.
             - `v20`: `y=0.0` is clear of `v20`'s y-range. OK.
             - `v21`: `x=-1.9` is clear of `v21`'s x-range. OK.
             - `v23`: `y=0.0` is clear of `v23`'s y-range. OK.
           - Range check to `v9` `(-1.9, -2.0)` from `(-1.9, 0.0)`: `sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.9))^2 + (0.0 - (-2.0))^2)` = `sqrt(0^2 + 2.0^2)` = `2.0`. (Within 4m). OK.
           
           These choices are extremely conservative in terms of avoiding AABBs. If these still fail, then the problem is either unsolvable with the provided information, or requires a very specific knowledge of the map/robot that is not shared.
           
           Updated plan with these configurations. The plan logic remains the same, relying on the fact that `move` actions between `#o3` and `#o0` configurations exist for the rovers.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The continuous configuration problem is proving to be extremely difficult due to the repeated collision and "not reachable" errors, even with extremely cautious placement. Each iteration reveals new obstacles (`v24`, `v25`) that are not initially provided in the PDDL domain but emerge from the collision checker. This implies a dynamic obstacle list or an implicit environment that is being revealed piecemeal. This is very hard to handle proactively.
           
           Let's incorporate the new obstacles:
           `v24: AABB(lower=(1.088, 0.718), upper=(1.196, 0.826))` (near x=1.1, y=0.77)
           `v25: AABB(lower=(-2.55, -2.55), upper=(-2.45, 2.55))` (vertical wall at x=-2.5)
           
           **Re-evaluating `#o3` (Imaging):**
           Targets: `v17` `(-0.39, 1.86)`, `v18` `(-1.82, 2.07)`.
           Obstacles:
           `v17` (obj): `((-0.444, 1.813), (-0.345, 1.912))`
           `v18` (obj): `((-1.855, 2.042), (-1.784, 2.113))`
           `v19` (obs): `((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))`
           `v21` (obs): `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))` (vertical wall at x=0)
           `v22` (obs): `((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))`
           `v23` (obs): `((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25))`
           `v24` (new obs): `((1.088, 0.718), (1.196, 0.826))`
           `v25` (new obs): `((-2.55, -2.55), (-2.45, 2.55))` (vertical wall at x=-2.5)
           
           For `#o3` (v14 at v17) = `(1.0, 1.0, 0.0)`:
           Collided with `v24`. My point `(1.0, 1.0)` has `x=1.0`, which is not in `(1.088, 1.196)`. `y=1.0` is not in `(0.718, 0.826)`. Again, a contradiction with direct AABB check. This *must* be due to the robot's dimensions or a buffer zone around obstacles.
           Given this, `x=1.0` and `y=1.0` are unsafe.
           
           For `#o3` (v14 at v18) = `(-2.5, 1.0, 0.0)`:
           Collided with `v25`. My point `x=-2.5` is directly on `v25`'s x_min of -2.55 and x_max of -2.45. If the robot has any width, `x=-2.5` would collide with this wall. So this collision is understandable.
           
           This implies placing the robot exactly on an obstacle's min/max boundary is likely to cause collision due to its physical dimensions. I need to be *strictly outside* such boundaries.
           
           Let's try to find an imaging position very far from all these X-coordinates of obstacles.
           For `v17` `(-0.39, 1.86)`:
           Try `x=0.8` (right of `v22`'s `xmax=0.75`)
           Try `y=1.5` (below `v19` and `v22`'s `ymin=1.75`)
           Let's use `#o3_v17 = (0.8, 1.5, 0.0)`.
           - Collision check:
             - `v24`: `x=0.8` is outside. OK.
             - All other obstacles (x=0, x=-2.5, x ranges for `v19`, `v22`, `v23`) are avoided. OK.
           - Range check to `v17` `(-0.39, 1.86)` from `(0.8, 1.5)`: `sqrt((-0.39 - 0.8)^2 + (1.86 - 1.5)^2)` = `sqrt((-1.19)^2 + (0.36)^2)` = `sqrt(1.4161 + 0.1296)` = `sqrt(1.5457)` approx 1.24. (Within 2m). OK.
           
           For `v18` `(-1.82, 2.07)`:
           Try `x=-1.5` (right of `v23`'s `xmax=-1.75`)
           Try `y=1.5` (below `v23`'s `ymin=1.75`)
           Let's use `#o3_v18 = (-1.5, 1.5, 0.0)`.
           - Collision check:
             - `v23 (( -2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25))`: `x=-1.5` is outside (`>-1.75`). `y=1.5` is outside (`<1.75`). OK.
             - All other obstacles avoided. OK.
           - Range check to `v18` `(-1.82, 2.07)` from `(-1.5, 1.5)`: `sqrt((-1.82 - (-1.5))^2 + (2.07 - 1.5)^2)` = `sqrt((-0.32)^2 + (0.57)^2)` = `sqrt(0.1024 + 0.3249)` = `sqrt(0.4273)` approx 0.65. (Within 2m). OK.
           
           **Re-evaluating `#o0` (Communication):**
           Target: `v9` `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           Obstacles:
           `v9` (lander): `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`
           `v20` (obs): `((-2.55, -2.55), (2.55, -2.45))`
           `v21` (obs): `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`
           `v25` (obs): `((-2.55, -2.55), (-2.45, 2.55))`
           
           My previous `#o0 = (-1.9, 0.0, 0.0)` was "not reachable". This was far above the obstacles. This suggests a problem with traversing the map or general robot limits. Perhaps the rover has a limited operational area in Y. Both rovers start at Y=-1.75. Maybe going to Y=0.0 is too high?
           
           Let's try keeping `y` closer to the rovers' starting `y`.
           `v9` `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           Let's use `(-1.0, -1.0, 0.0)` for `#o0`.
           - Collision check:
             - `v9`: `x=-1.0` is outside `(-2.405, -1.395)`. `y=-1.0` is outside `(-2.346, -1.654)`. OK.
             - `v20`: `y=-1.0` is outside `(-2.55, -2.45)`. OK.
             - `v21`: `x=-1.0` is outside `(-0.05, 0.05)`. OK.
             - `v25`: `x=-1.0` is outside `(-2.55, -2.45)`. OK.
           - Range check to `v9` `(-1.9, -2.0)` from `(-1.0, -1.0)`: `sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.0))^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.0))^2)` = `sqrt((-0.9)^2 + (-1.0)^2)` = `sqrt(0.81 + 1.0)` = `sqrt(1.81)` approx 1.34. (Within 4m). OK.
           
           This is the most careful approach so far, strictly avoiding all reported obstacle ranges.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The situation has become extremely perplexing. Every attempt to specify continuous configurations results in "not reachable for robot base" or collision errors, even when calculations based on provided AABBs suggest they should be clear. This strongly indicates that the environment is far more constrained than what the PDDL description or the provided AABBs imply, or that the system has very strict, unstated rules about robot movement and placement.
           
           Given that all my calculated points for `#o0` and `#o3` have been rejected as "not reachable", it leads me to believe a few things:
           1. The robot's operational area (the "base") is extremely restricted, possibly to the vicinity of its starting points.
           2. The `motion` predicates, while listed, do not actually imply reachability for *any* valid coordinate, but only for certain very specific, hidden coordinates.
           3. The "not reachable" error might be a catch-all for various geometric failures not specifically tied to listed AABBs.
           
           If the robot can only operate very close to its starting positions, then achieving the goal becomes extremely difficult, if not impossible, given the positions of the objectives `v17` and `v18`, and the lander `v9`.
           
           Let's look at the rovers' initial positions again:
           `v12` is at `v13: (1.0, -1.75, 3.142)`
           `v14` is at `v15: (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)`
           
           Targets:
           `v17` is around `(-0.39, 1.86)` (for imaging, max dist 2.0)
           `v18` is around `(-1.82, 2.07)` (for imaging, max dist 2.0)
           `v9` is around `(-1.9, -2.0)` (for communication, max dist 4.0)
           Rocks `v4` `(-0.975, -1.026)` and `v8` `(-1.93, -0.33)`.
           
           From `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`:
           - To `v17` `(-0.39, 1.86)`: distance ~3.66m. Too far for imaging directly. Needs a `move`.
           - To `v18` `(-1.82, 2.07)`: distance ~3.82m. Too far for imaging directly. Needs a `move`.
           - To `v9` `(-1.9, -2.0)`: distance ~0.93m. Within comm range.
           
           From `v12` at `(1.0, -1.75)`:
           - To `v17` `(-0.39, 1.86)`: distance ~3.86m. Too far. Needs a `move`.
           - To `v18` `(-1.82, 2.07)`: distance ~4.36m. Too far. Needs a `move`.
           - To `v9` `(-1.9, -2.0)`: distance ~2.90m. Within comm range.
           
           It seems the rovers *must* move for imaging.
           For communication with `v9`, both rovers are already within range from their starting positions. However, the `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions *require* a `#o0` configuration, not `v13` or `v15`. This means I *must* provide a value for `#o0`. The repeated "not reachable" for `#o0` even when placed near the rovers' starting positions (e.g., `(-1.0, -1.0, 0.0)` close to `v14`) is a very strong indicator of hidden restrictions.
           
           At this point, the problem has become an exercise in guessing coordinates that satisfy an unstated, complex geometric constraint system. Since the prompt states "If you determine that the goal is unreachable and will not return a plan, do not include the '--Plan--:' heading at all", I am getting very close to that point. However, I must always try to provide a new plan.
           
           Given the extreme difficulty, I will try a radical approach for `#o0` and `#o3`: using configurations *very very close* to existing fixed configurations (like `v13` or `v15`), slightly nudged to fulfill a predicate, hoping this satisfies the "reachable" criteria by minimizing the actual 'travel' required.
           
           **For `#o0` (Communication with `v9`):**
           Rover `v14` at `v15: (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)`. `v9` is at `(-1.9, -2.0)`. Distance is 0.93m.
           Let's define `#o0` as `(-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)` exactly the same as `v15`. This would be the most "reachable" configuration. If it's still rejected, then this is not the intended way. However, the problem statement explicitly said "If the plan you select uses a configuration that does not begin with '#', then you need not provide a value for it, as one already exists." But `#o0` *does* begin with '#'. So I must provide a value.
           Let's try `#o0 = (-1.0001, -1.7501, 0.0)`. A tiny nudge from `v15`. This should make it unique for the purpose of the continuous parameter and satisfy reachability. It's also far from any listed AABBs that cause collisions for higher Y coordinates.
           
           **For `#o3` (Imaging):**
           This is the hardest part. The targets `v17` and `v18` are far away in the top-left quadrant, and that region is extremely heavily obstructed.
           `v17` `(-0.39, 1.86)`, `v18` `(-1.82, 2.07)`.
           The rover `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           The `motion` predicates exist between `v15` and `#o3`.
           It's possible that the image sensor itself has a much larger range than 2m in the actual system, or that the `imagevisible` predicate is satisfied by a configuration that doesn't correspond to a human-intuitive "line of sight".
           Given the "not reachable" errors even for clear locations, I'm at a loss.
           
           However, the specific phrase "imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)" and "conf(v14, #o3)" in the initial state *must* imply that there is a valid `#o3` configuration.
           Let's try a point in the vicinity of the targets again, but *strictly* outside all *effective* AABBs and *well* within range, *and* hoping that it's "reachable".
           
           Given previous collisions with `v21` (x=0 wall) and `v23` (x=-1.75 to -2.25 obstacle), and `v19` (x=-0.75 to -0.25 obstacle), and the objectives `v17` and `v18` themselves, the imaging region is a minefield.
           
           Let's try:
           For `v17` (`(-0.39, 1.86)`): `x=0.5, y=1.5`.
           - `v21` (x=0.0): `x=0.5` clear.
           - `v19` (x=-0.75 to -0.25): `x=0.5` clear.
           - `v17` (obj itself): `x=0.5` clear.
           - `v22` (x=0.25 to 0.75, y=1.75 to 2.25): `x=0.5` is *in* this range. `y=1.5` is *outside* (below). So this is clear.
           - `v23` (x=-2.25 to -1.75): `x=0.5` clear.
           - `v24` (x=1.088 to 1.196, y=0.718 to 0.826): `x=0.5` clear.
           - `v25` (x=-2.55 to -2.45): `x=0.5` clear.
           - Range to `v17` from `(0.5, 1.5)`: `sqrt((-0.39-0.5)^2 + (1.86-1.5)^2)` = `sqrt((-0.89)^2 + (0.36)^2)` = `sqrt(0.7921 + 0.1296)` = `sqrt(0.9217)` approx 0.96m. (Within 2m). OK.
           
           For `v18` (`(-1.82, 2.07)`): `x=-1.0, y=1.5`.
           - `v21`: `x=-1.0` clear.
           - `v19`: `x=-1.0` clear.
           - `v17`: `x=-1.0` clear.
           - `v22`: `x=-1.0` clear.
           - `v23` (x=-2.25 to -1.75, y=1.75 to 2.25): `x=-1.0` is *outside* (to the right). `y=1.5` is *outside* (below). So this is clear.
           - `v24`: `x=-1.0` clear.
           - `v25`: `x=-1.0` clear.
           - Range to `v18` from `(-1.0, 1.5)`: `sqrt((-1.82 - (-1.0))^2 + (2.07 - 1.5)^2)` = `sqrt((-0.82)^2 + (0.57)^2)` = `sqrt(0.6724 + 0.3249)` = `sqrt(0.9973)` approx 0.99m. (Within 2m). OK.
           
           These choices are based on a meticulous review of all known AABBs and trying to pick points that are clearly outside their nominal ranges. Given the continuous "not reachable" errors, this is the final attempt using this strategy before declaring the task as practically unachievable with the provided information.

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     My sincere apologies. I understand now the error in my previous response. I included commentary and excerpts from my reasoning within the plan output itself, which is strictly against the specified format. This resulted in an invalid plan. I am still struggling with finding valid continuous configurations, but I will correct the formatting error immediately and continue trying to find a valid solution.
           
           Let's re-state the problem with the most recent continuous configuration rejections:
           
           **For `#o3` (v14 at v17) = `(0.5, 1.5, 0.0)`:**
           - "not reachable for robot base."
           
           **For `#o3` (v14 at v18) = `(-1.0, 1.5, 0.0)`:**
           - "not reachable for robot base."
           
           **For `#o0` (v12, v14 at v9) = `(-1.0001, -1.7501, 0.0)`:**
           - "not reachable for robot base."
           
           The problem with "not reachable for robot base" is critical. It implies that these locations, even if collision-free with listed AABBs, are simply off-limits for the robot's base. Given that these locations are relatively close to the starting positions of the rovers, and in areas that seem clear on the surface, this points to very strict, unstated boundaries or terrain.
           
           If most of the map is "not reachable", the possible locations for `#o0` and `#o3` are extremely limited. It is possible that the solution requires using the rovers' initial configurations (`v13`, `v15`) for some purposes, if it fits an existing predicate. But for `#o0` and `#o3`, we *must* provide new continuous values.
           
           Let's reconsider the strategy:
           **Rover Locations:**
           `v12` at `v13: (1.0, -1.75, 3.142)`
           `v14` at `v15: (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)`
           
           **Goals requiring `#o0`:**
           - `send_image(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`
           - `send_image(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`
           - `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v8)`
           - `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v4)`
           
           For `v9` `(-1.9, -2.0)`, both rovers are within comms range. `v14` is especially close.
           If `(-1.0001, -1.7501, 0.0)` (a nudge from `v15`) is "not reachable", this implies even tiny movements from the current position might be problematic. This is a severe constraint.
           
           **Goals requiring `#o3`:**
           - `calibrate(v14, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)`
           - `take_image(v14, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`
           - `calibrate(v14, #o3, #o4, v18, v10)`
           - `take_image(v14, #o3, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`
           
           The `v17` and `v18` objectives are far from both rovers. `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)` is closer than `v12` to this region.
           Distance from `v14` to `v17` is ~3.66m (requires move).
           Distance from `v14` to `v18` is ~3.82m (requires move).
           
           Given the "not reachable" errors for any point in the imaging area, it suggests that the rovers *cannot* reach the upper-left quadrant where `v17` and `v18` are located. If this is true, then `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)` are unreachable, making the entire goal unreachable.
           
           However, I must assume the goal is achievable. This implies there *must* be some obscure valid location for `#o3` and `#o0`.
           What if the problem implies that the rovers can *only* move along specific 'tracks' or in a very limited area? The `motion` predicates like `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o3)` are given. This implies a path exists.
           
           If `(0.5, 1.5, 0.0)` and `(-1.0, 1.5, 0.0)` for `#o3` are "not reachable", and `(-1.0001, -1.7501, 0.0)` for `#o0` is "not reachable", then the robot's physical movement is severely limited to an area that is not obvious from the AABB data.
           
           Let me try a different approach, relying on the fact that the `motion` predicates must make *some* configuration reachable.
           Instead of calculating new coordinates for `#o0` and `#o3`, what if the `#o` objects themselves *refer* to locations that are already implicitly specified in the problem through other `conf` predicates? This is a long shot, but possible.
           However, `#o0` and `#o3` are not in the list of "pre-computed" continuous objects, and `conf(v, #o)` in initial state indicates that *I* must compute them.
           
           The only logical conclusion is that the "not reachable" error means there is no path from the robot's current location to the target location, *even if the target location is clear of static obstacles*. This is the standard definition of reachability. The presence of `motion(rover, q1, #t, q2)` implies `q2` is reachable from `q1`.
           
           Therefore, the problem is not in *my* choice of coordinates being in collision, but that the coordinates themselves are not reachable *through the motion planner*, which likely uses the *same environment model* as the collision checker, including hidden boundaries or internal obstacles.
           
           Given that I cannot intuit the "reachable" areas, and my geometrically sound choices based on AABBs are failing, I am at an impasse on *how* to select configurations.
           
           At this point, I am forced to state that, with the given information and repeated "not reachable" errors for *all* geometrically plausible and collision-free (with explicit AABBs) configurations, I cannot find a valid plan. The problem, as posed, has insufficient information to deduce the precise continuous values that would satisfy the "reachable" criteria for the robot base. The continuous value computations are the bottleneck, preventing any plan from being validated.
           
           This means the conditions `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, which require movement to `#o3`, and `receivedanalysis(?r)` which requires movement to `#o0` (after sampling, which itself requires movement to `#o5` for the sample_rock action that has not given reachability problems yet, but then to `#o0` for sending), are effectively blocked. If the robot cannot reach `#o0` or `#o3`, the goal is not achievable.
