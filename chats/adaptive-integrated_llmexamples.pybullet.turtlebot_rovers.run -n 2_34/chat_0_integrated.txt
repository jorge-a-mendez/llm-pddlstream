           Object v3 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.356, 1.234), (-0.273, 1.317)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks us to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is a conjunction of several conditions. Let's break down the axiom definition to understand the goal:
           `Axiom new-axiom@0()
             Conjunction
               Atom atconf(v12, v13)
               Atom atconf(v14, v15)
               Atom free(v12, v16)
               Atom free(v14, v16)
               Atom receivedimage(v17, v11)
               Atom receivedimage(v18, v11)
               Atom type(?stone, v2)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?stone)
               Atom type(?soil, v6)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           From the initial state, we already have:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: True
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: True
           - `free(v12, v16)`: True
           - `free(v14, v16)`: True
           - `type(v1, v2)`: This means v1 is a stone.
           - `type(v3, v2)`: This means v3 is a stone.
           - `type(v4, v2)`: This means v4 is a stone.
           - `type(v5, v6)`: This means v5 is a soil.
           - `type(v7, v6)`: This means v7 is a soil.
           - `type(v8, v6)`: This means v8 is a soil.
           
           The remaining parts of the goal are:
           1. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           2. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           3. `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for at least one stone.
           4. `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for at least one soil.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`, the rover needs to `take_image` and then `send_image`.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis`, the rover needs to `sample_rock` and then `send_analysis`.
           
           Let's examine the available actions and initial state to see how we can achieve these:
           
           **For `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:**
           - Rover `v12` has a camera `v10` that supports mode `v11`.
           - Rover `v14` has a camera `v10` that supports mode `v11`.
           
           We need to:
           1. `calibrate` a camera (e.g., `v10` on `v12`) towards `v17` and `v18`.
           2. `take_image` of `v17` with `v11` using the calibrated camera.
           3. `take_image` of `v18` with `v11` using the calibrated camera.
           4. `send_image` of `v17` with `v11` to `v9` (lander).
           5. `send_image` of `v18` with `v11` to `v9` (lander).
           
           From the initial state, we have:
           - `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`: Rover `v14` can see `v17` and `v18` from configuration `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           - `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`: Rover `v12` can see `v17` and `v18` from configuration `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           
           Let's use `v14` for imaging, as it's already at `v15` which is near where it can sample.
           
           **For `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`:**
           - We need to find a rock that is a `stone` (type `v2`) and a rock that is a `soil` (type `v6`).
           - We need to `sample_rock` with a rover.
           - We need to `send_analysis` of the sampled rock.
           
           From initial state:
           - Rocks of type `v2` (stone): `v1`, `v3`, `v4`.
           - Rocks of type `v6` (soil): `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           - Rover `v14` is `above` `v3`, `v7`, `v5`, `v1`, `v8`, `v4` at configuration `#o5`.
           - Rover `v12` is `above` `v5`, `v7`, `v4`, `v1`, `v3`, `v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           
           Let's use `v14` for sampling since it's above several rocks from `#o5`.
           - `v14` is above `v3` (stone) at `#o5`.
           - `v14` is above `v7` (soil) at `#o5`.
           - `v14` has a free store `v16`.
           
           So, the plan would involve:
           1. Rover `v14` needs to be at `#o3` to `calibrate` and `take_image` of `v17` and `v18`.
           2. Rover `v14` needs to be at `#o0` to `send_image` of `v17` and `v18`.
           3. Rover `v14` needs to be at `#o5` to `sample_rock` `v3` (stone) and `v7` (soil).
           4. Rover `v14` needs to be at `#o0` to `send_analysis` of `v3` and `v7`.
           
           The problem states that we can only use the given action instances, which are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`, `(drop_rock v12 v16)`, `(drop_rock v14 v16)`.
           These move actions only allow the rovers to move to the same configuration they are currently in, which means no actual movement is possible for the rovers to reach `#o0`, `#o3`, or `#o5` from their initial configurations `v13` or `v15`.
           The only configurations at which actions can be performed are `v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14`. However, `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` predicates are only true for the configurations starting with '#', which means no imaging, communication, or sampling can be done from `v13` or `v15`.
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable because the rovers cannot move to the configurations where the necessary actions (take_image, send_image, sample_rock, send_analysis) are possible. The only allowed move actions lead to the same configuration, meaning no change in location for the rovers.
           
           Based on the available actions, the rovers are stuck at their initial positions `v13` and `v15`. All the `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` predicates, which are preconditions for `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`, are only true for configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`. Since there are no actions to move `v12` to `#o0`, `#o3`, or `#o5` from `v13`, or `v14` to `#o0`, `#o3`, or `#o5` from `v15`, these actions cannot be performed. Therefore, the goal cannot be achieved.
