           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Inability to Achieve the Goal**
           
           Based on the given initial state and the permissible actions, I've concluded that the target state, represented by `new-axiom@0()`, is unattainable. The essential preconditions for achieving the sub-goals of image acquisition and analysis—namely, the availability of image visibility, communication visibility, and object-above relationships—are tied to specific, continuous configurations denoted by symbols like `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`. However, the robots, `v12` and `v14`, are constrained by their initial configurations, `v13` and `v15` respectively, and their movement actions restrict them to those initial locations.
           
           The system's definition clearly states that a robot's configuration *must* align with a visible, communicable, or above state *at that configuration* to be used. Since there are no such predicates for the robots' *fixed* configurations, the required actions cannot be executed. This fundamental constraint on movement prevents the rovers from attaining the necessary configurations to perform image acquisition, communication, and rock sampling. Thus, the ultimate goal is not achievable under the given conditions.
