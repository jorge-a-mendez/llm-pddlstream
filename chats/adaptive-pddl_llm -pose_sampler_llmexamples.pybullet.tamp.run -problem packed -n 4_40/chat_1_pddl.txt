           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes several graspable and stackable objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) located on a surface (v11). There are two arms (v4 and v6), both currently empty. The robot is at a base configuration v3 and can move. The goal is to place all four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) onto the surface v18.
           
           However, the only allowed action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action moves the robot's base from configuration v3 to v3, using a trajectory #o0. This means the robot effectively stays in the same base configuration.
           
           To achieve the goal of placing objects on `v18`, the robot would need to use `pick` and `place` actions. `pick` actions require `kin` facts that include the arm, object, current pose, a grasp, a base configuration, and an arm trajectory. `place` actions also require `kin` facts, a currently held object, and a target pose on `v18`.
           
           The current state shows that objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` are supported by `v11` at their current poses. The goal is to have them `on` `v18`, which means they need to be placed at a pose supported by `v18`.
           
           The initial state provides several `kin` facts for arm `v4` with objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` to pick them up from their current poses and place them at various poses (including `#o2`) using grasp `#o1` and base configuration `#o3` and arm trajectory `#o4`. However, `atbconf(#o3)` is not asserted in the initial state. The current `atbconf` is `v3`. Although there is a `bconf(#o3)` fact, it does not mean the robot is currently at that base configuration. Similarly, the `atraj(#o4)` and `btraj(#o0)` are just objects, not necessarily currently executed or valid trajectories.
           
           Crucially, no `pick` or `place` action instances are provided in the list of allowed actions. Since the robot can only `move_base` from `v3` to `v3`, it cannot pick up or place any objects. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
           
           The only action instance provided is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not change the state of any object, nor does it allow the robot to pick up or place objects. To achieve the goal, the robot needs to use `pick` and `place` actions, which are not available in the allowed action instances list. Therefore, the goal is not achievable.
