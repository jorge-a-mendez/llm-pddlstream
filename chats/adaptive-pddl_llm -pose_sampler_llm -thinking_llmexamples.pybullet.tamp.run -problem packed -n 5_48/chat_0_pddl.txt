(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: A Square, a Surface, and 50 Rotations**
           
           I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5, size approximately 0.077 units) on a square surface (0.27 units x 0.27 units, centered at the origin). Stability, for my purposes, means the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) remains entirely within the surface's boundaries after rotation.
           
           The key to this problem lies in understanding the rotated AABB of a square.  Because of its symmetry, a square's AABB only changes its dimensions within the range of 0 to pi/4. At 0 and pi/2, the AABB is just the original square. At pi/4, the AABB reaches its maximum size (side * sqrt(2)).  The surface is large enough to comfortably accommodate the rotated object, even at maximum diagonal size.
           
           My initial thought was to combine a few rotations with a small grid of x,y positions within the surface. But since I know that placing the object at the center (0,0) of the surface is always stable, I'm choosing a more efficient strategy.
           
           Given these considerations, I'll generate 50 placements. Each placement is at the center of the surface (x=0, y=0), but with a different rotation. The rotations vary from 0 to 2*pi in equal increments (50 steps). This approach guarantees stability, due to the square object's symmetry and the surface's size. Each placement is thus a unique rotation of the object, providing a diverse set of final placements.
           
           In code, this translates to: varying theta =  i * (2 * math.pi / 50) for i from 0 to 49, with x=0 and y=0.
           
           This strategy will generate a set of placements fulfilling all given constraints: it results in 50 diverse, stable placements, and avoids unnecessary complexity.

(Thoughts: **Alright, here's my breakdown of how I'm going to figure out where to place this new object on the surface:**
           
           I've got a new object, ID 4, that's a square. I know where object 5 is, and I can't let them collide. So, I need to figure out the right spot for this new object. 
           
           First, I looked at the size and shape of the new object (ID 4) and the surface it needs to be on. I calculated the maximum width and height (the AABB) of object 4, no matter how it's rotated. I also knew that the surface is a square. Since object 4 is smaller than the surface, I can place it anywhere on that surface, even at the center (0,0).
           
           But here's the catch: object 5 is already on the surface, right at the center. I can't put the new object right on top of it. So I have to find a spot that will keep it safe. I needed to move the object so that their centers are far enough apart so they do not overlap.
           
           I calculated the bounding boxes of both objects, object 4 and object 5, and figured out how close they could get without touching. I made sure to add a little space so they wouldn't bump into each other. I'll need to remember that distance so I don't accidentally put the new object too close. I will also have to avoid collision with its AABB.
           
           I started thinking about putting object 4 with its center at (0, 0), and quickly realized that will not work. I know that since the object sizes are very close to one another in terms of their respective sizes, they need to be far apart to avoid collision. Then I found what locations can work.
           
           I then considered rotating object 4. I quickly realized if it is rotated, it will take up a lot of space on the surface. Since I needed to place multiple objects, I decided it is better if the rotation of object 4 can only have specific angles, like at 0 degrees, or a multiple of 90 degrees. I will then pick locations for object 4 where I can fit multiple objects.
           
           I know I have to generate 50 positions. I thought it would be best if these locations were along the edges or on the surface of the object. I need to make sure all those spots avoid collisions with the other existing object.
           
           I finally created a set of placements. I came up with 50 locations for the new object and made sure that the new placements are along the surface edges to satisfy the requirements. I am confident that these 50 placements will work.
