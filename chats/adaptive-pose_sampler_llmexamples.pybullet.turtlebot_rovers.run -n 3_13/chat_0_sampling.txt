User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is essentially a square room with a central vertical divider. There are several smaller obstacles scattered around, some near the walls and some more central. The target point is (0.8407886439167232, 0.6559798952409744). The max range is 2. I need to find 3 base positions (x,y) within this range.
           
           The square room is defined by the bounding boxes 0 to 4. Obstacle 5 is a vertical divider at x=0. The other obstacles are smaller boxes. I will try to place the robot in open areas, avoiding these obstacles.
           
           Target point: (0.84, 0.66)
           
           Let's consider some candidate points.
           1. Directly behind the target (from the perspective of the origin), so roughly (0.84, -0.66) but within 2 units.
           2. To the left of the target, around (0.84 - 2, 0.66) or (0.84-1.5, 0.66).
           3. To the right of the target, around (0.84 + 2, 0.66) which would be out of bounds, so closer to the wall.
           4. Above the target, around (0.84, 0.66+2) but within bounds.
           5. Below the target, around (0.84, 0.66-2) within bounds.
           
           Given the target (0.84, 0.66), a point at (0.84, 0.66 - 1.5) = (0.84, -0.84) would be within the 2m range and might be clear of obstacles.
           Another point to the left, (0.84 - 1.5, 0.66) = (-0.66, 0.66). This is to the left of the central divider (obstacle 5) so it could be clear.
           Another point slightly above and to the right, (0.84 + 0.8, 0.66 + 0.8) = (1.64, 1.46). This is within the max range.
           
           Let's check for collisions with the fixed obstacles for these candidates.
           
           Candidate 1: (0.84, -0.84)
           - Obstacle 13: ((-0.48, -0.55), (-0.35, -0.42)) - No overlap
           - Obstacle 14: ((1.46, -0.16), (1.57, -0.05)) - No overlap
           - Obstacle 15: ((-1.43, -0.90), (-1.30, -0.77)) - No overlap
           - Obstacle 16: ((-0.78, -2.17), (-0.64, -2.03)) - No overlap
           - Obstacle 17: ((0.70, -2.43), (0.83, -2.30)) - No overlap
           - Obstacle 18: ((0.44, -0.51), (0.58, -0.37)) - No overlap
           This seems clear.
           
           Candidate 2: (-0.66, 0.66)
           - Obstacle 11: ((-1.64, 0.73), (-1.52, 0.86)) - No overlap
           - Obstacle 12: ((-2.14, 1.00), (-2.00, 1.14)) - No overlap
           - Obstacle 13: ((-0.48, -0.55), (-0.35, -0.42)) - No overlap
           - Obstacle 15: ((-1.43, -0.90), (-1.30, -0.77)) - No overlap
           This seems clear.
           
           Candidate 3: (1.64, 1.46)
           - Obstacle 7: ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) - No overlap
           - Obstacle 14: ((1.46, -0.16), (1.57, -0.05)) - No overlap
           - Obstacle 19: ((1.85, 1.93), (1.94, 2.02)) - No overlap
           This seems clear.
           
           All three positions are within the x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5] bounds.
           Distance from (0.84, 0.66) to (0.84, -0.84) is 1.5. (Valid)
           Distance from (0.84, 0.66) to (-0.66, 0.66) is 1.5. (Valid)
           Distance from (0.84, 0.66) to (1.64, 1.46) is sqrt((1.64-0.84)^2 + (1.46-0.66)^2) = sqrt(0.8^2 + 0.8^2) = sqrt(0.64 + 0.64) = sqrt(1.28) which is approx 1.13. (Valid)
           
           Positions:
           (0.84 -0.84)
           (-0.66 0.66)
           (1.64 1.46)
           

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The previous request was for a target point different from the current one. The provided feedback pertains to the target point (-0.6884114146232605, 2.1168460845947266). I will keep this in mind for future requests for that specific target. For the current target, I'm starting fresh with my geometric reasoning.
           
           The target point is (0.8407886439167232, 0.6559798952409744). I need to find 3 base positions (x,y) within distance 2 from this target, avoiding fixed obstacles and ensuring line-of-sight. Max range is 2.
           
           The fixed obstacles are as follows:
           0: ((-2.5, -2.5), (2.5, 2.5)) - This is the outer boundary of the room.
           1: ((-2.55, 2.45), (2.55, 2.55)) - Top wall
           2: ((-2.55, -2.55), (2.55, -2.45)) - Bottom wall
           3: ((2.45, -2.55), (2.55, 2.55)) - Right wall
           4: ((-2.55, -2.55), (-2.45, 2.55)) - Left wall
           5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)) - Central vertical wall. This is a significant obstacle.
           Other numbered obstacles are smaller boxes.
           
           Target: (0.84, 0.66). This target is to the right of the central vertical wall (obstacle 5).
           
           Let's try to find positions around the target.
           1. Directly to the right of the target. (0.84 + 1.5, 0.66) = (2.34, 0.66). This is close to the right wall (obstacle 3) but within limits.
           2. Directly to the left of the target. (0.84 - 1.5, 0.66) = (-0.66, 0.66). This point is to the left of the central divider (obstacle 5). This might have line of sight issues or be too close to obstacle 5 if the target is close to the divider.
           3. Directly below the target. (0.84, 0.66 - 1.5) = (0.84, -0.84). This seems like a reasonable spot.
           4. Directly above the target. (0.84, 0.66 + 1.5) = (0.84, 2.16). This point is close to the top wall (obstacle 1).
           
           Let's re-evaluate based on the fixed obstacles.
           Target is (0.84, 0.66).
           
           Candidate 1: (2.34, 0.66)
           - Distance from target: sqrt((2.34-0.84)^2 + (0.66-0.66)^2) = sqrt(1.5^2) = 1.5. (Valid)
           - Obstacle 3: ((2.45, -2.55), (2.55, 2.55)) - This position (2.34, 0.66) is outside this obstacle.
           - Obstacle 14: ((1.46, -0.16), (1.57, -0.05)) - No overlap.
           This seems like a good position.
           
           Candidate 2: (0.84, -0.84)
           - Distance from target: sqrt((0.84-0.84)^2 + (-0.84-0.66)^2) = sqrt((-1.5)^2) = 1.5. (Valid)
           - Obstacle 13: ((-0.48, -0.55), (-0.35, -0.42)) - No overlap.
           - Obstacle 14: ((1.46, -0.16), (1.57, -0.05)) - No overlap.
           - Obstacle 18: ((0.44, -0.51), (0.58, -0.37)) - No overlap.
           - Obstacle 17: ((0.70, -2.43), (0.83, -2.30)) - No overlap.
           This seems like a good position.
           
           Candidate 3: (0.84, 2.16)
           - Distance from target: sqrt((0.84-0.84)^2 + (2.16-0.66)^2) = sqrt(1.5^2) = 1.5. (Valid)
           - Obstacle 1: ((-2.55, 2.45), (2.55, 2.55)) - No overlap, but close to the top wall.
           - Obstacle 7: ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) - No overlap.
           - Obstacle 9: ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)) - No overlap, but close to the obstacle. It passes the obstacle to the right side of 0.75.
           - Obstacle 19: ((1.85, 1.93), (1.94, 2.02)) - No overlap.
           This also seems like a good position.
           
           It's important to remember the central divider (obstacle 5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))). Any point on the left of this divider, like (-0.66, 0.66) for this target (0.84, 0.66), would likely have an occlusion. So, I will avoid crossing the central divider for this target.
           
           Positions:
           (2.34 0.66)
           (0.84 -0.84)
           (0.84 2.16)
