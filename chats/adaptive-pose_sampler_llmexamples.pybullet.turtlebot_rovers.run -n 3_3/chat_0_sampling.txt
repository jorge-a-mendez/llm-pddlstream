           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is largely enclosed by a perimeter of obstacles, specifically AABBs 0-4. There's also a vertical obstacle (AABB 5) in the center at x=0. Several smaller obstacles are scattered around the environment. I will try to find positions for the robot base that are within 2 units of the target point. I will prioritize positions that are not too close to the obstacles, and try to place the robot in open areas. The strategy will involve picking points on a circle of radius 1.5 around the target point, and then adjusting them slightly to avoid potential collisions with fixed obstacles. Since I need to provide 3 positions, I will try to spread them out.

           The target point is (-0.975762040409405, 1.453303792043695). It's in the upper-left quadrant.
           I will try to place the robot on the left side of the center wall (AABB 5), as the target is also on the left.
           Considering the max range of 2, the valid x range for the robot base is approximately [-2.5, 0] and y range is approximately [-0.5, 2.5].
           
           Position 1: Directly to the left of the target point, at a distance of about 1.5. This would be roughly at x = -2.47, y = 1.45. This looks like a reasonable spot as it's not directly in front of any significant obstacles on its path to the target. However, it's close to the left wall (AABB 4) and the top left obstacle (AABB 8). I will adjust x to be -2.0.
           
           Position 2: Below the target point. Around x = -0.97, y = 0.0. This seems to be in a relatively open area.
           
           Position 3: To the right of the target point, but still on the left side of the central wall. This means x should be slightly negative, and y can be around the target's y. For example, x = -0.2, y = 1.0. This avoids the central obstacle (AABB 5) and gives a good line of sight.
           
           Let's refine these:
           
           Target: (-0.975762040409405, 1.453303792043695)
           
           1. Base: (-2.0, 1.4533). This is far from the target (distance sqrt((-2 - -0.975)^2 + (1.4533 - 1.4533)^2) = 1.025, which is within max_range). This avoids obstacle 8 and 20 as much as possible. It is also not blocked by 17 or 18 or 10.
           
           2. Base: (-0.975762040409405, 0.0). This is directly below the target. Distance is 1.4533, within max_range. This avoids being near obstacle 5.
           
           3. Base: (-0.2, 1.0). This is to the right and slightly below the target. Distance is sqrt((-0.2 - -0.975)^2 + (1.0 - 1.4533)^2) = sqrt(0.775^2 + (-0.4533)^2) = sqrt(0.6006 + 0.2055) = sqrt(0.8061) = 0.897, within max_range. This position is good to avoid the central wall (AABB 5). It also seems to avoid other small obstacles.
           Positions:
           (-2.0 1.4533)
           (-0.975762040409405 0.0)
           (-0.2 1.0)

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     My previous attempts failed.
           The first position (-2.0, 1.4533) had no line of sight to the target (-2.1157, 1.8638). This suggests there's an obstacle between them, likely AABB 20 ((-2.16, 1.81), (-2.07, 1.90)) or AABB 8 ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)), both are in the upper left region.
           The second position (-0.975762040409405, 0.0) also had no line of sight to the target. The target is at y=1.86, and the proposed position is at y=0.0. There are several obstacles in between these y coordinates, like AABB 17, 18, 14.
           The third position (-0.2, 1.0) collided with AABB 5 ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)), the central vertical wall. This is a clear collision. I should ensure that any x-coordinate is less than -0.05 or greater than 0.05 when considering this wall. Since the target is at x = -2.1157, I should keep the robot base on the left side of this wall, so x should be less than -0.05.
           
           The new target point is (-2.115734100341797, 1.8638124465942383). This is very close to the previous target point and within the same region. It is in the upper left, very close to AABB 8, 20, and 1.
           I need to find positions within 2 units of this target, avoiding collisions and occlusions.
           
           Let's re-evaluate based on the new target: (-2.1157, 1.8638).
           
           1.  **Try positions further to the left, but not too close to the wall.** The previous point (-2.0, 1.4533) failed line of sight. The target is close to the corner defined by AABB 4 (left wall) and AABB 1 (top wall). Also near AABB 8 and AABB 20.
               I will try to place the robot below the target, but slightly offset to the left or right to avoid AABB 20 and AABB 8.
               Let's try a point directly below and slightly to the left.
               Target: (-2.1157, 1.8638)
               New proposed base: (-2.2, 0.5).
               Distance from target: sqrt((-2.2 - -2.1157)^2 + (0.5 - 1.8638)^2) = sqrt((-0.0843)^2 + (-1.3638)^2) = sqrt(0.0071 + 1.8600) = sqrt(1.8671) = 1.366. This is within max_range.
               This position moves significantly further down, avoiding the top obstacles and potentially giving a clear line of sight. It's also far from AABB 5.
           
           2.  **Try a position directly below the target, but further away from the obstacles.**
               New proposed base: (-1.5, 0.5).
               Distance from target: sqrt((-1.5 - -2.1157)^2 + (0.5 - 1.8638)^2) = sqrt((0.6157)^2 + (-1.3638)^2) = sqrt(0.3791 + 1.8600) = sqrt(2.2391) = 1.496. This is within max_range.
               This moves it more towards the right, but still well left of AABB 5. This should provide a clear line of sight, as it's below the target and away from the dense upper-left obstacles.
           
           3.  **Try a position slightly to the right of the target, and slightly below.**
               New proposed base: (-1.0, 1.5).
               Distance from target: sqrt((-1.0 - -2.1157)^2 + (1.5 - 1.8638)^2) = sqrt((1.1157)^2 + (-0.3638)^2) = sqrt(1.2447 + 0.1323) = sqrt(1.377) = 1.173. This is within max_range.
               This position is still on the left side of AABB 5 and tries to get around obstacles 8 and 20 by being more to the right. It avoids the central vertical wall and other obstacles that are further to the right.
           
           Positions:
           (-2.2 0.5)
           (-1.5 0.5)
           (-1.0 1.5)

           The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     My previous attempts were unsuccessful for the target point (-2.115734100341797, 1.8638124465942383).
           Let's analyze the failures from the last request:
           1.  Proposed position: (-2.2, 0.5) -- no line of sight to target. This is puzzling given its distance from the target and the primary obstacles around it. It suggests there might be an occlusion from an unknown dynamic obstacle, or I am underestimating the extent of existing fixed obstacles. The target is high up at y=1.86, and this position is low at y=0.5. There are small obstacles between y=0.5 and y=1.86 in the x range of -2.2 to -2.1, but none seem to fully block the line of sight from a low position. Perhaps AABB 6 (bottom left), or even AABB 18 (middle left) is causing a problem.
           
           2.  Proposed position: (-1.5, 0.5) -- no line of sight to target. Similar to the first, this position is also low. This reinforces the idea that there might be occlusions at lower y values when viewing this high target, or that the obstacles in the -1.5 to -2.1 x range and between y=0.5 and y=1.86 are more problematic than they appear. Obstacle 18 ((-1.52, 0.49), (-1.38, 0.63)) is very close to this position. This might be the culprit.
           
           3.  Proposed position: (-1.0, 1.5) -- no line of sight to target. This position is closer to the target's y-coordinate. However, it is between the target and the central wall. Obstacle 17 ((-0.54, 1.19), (-0.40, 1.33)) is in this general area. Obstacle 10 ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)) is also quite close. It is possible that these are blocking the view.
           
           The new target point is still (-2.115734115966797, 1.8638124465942383). The problem seems to be finding a line of sight to this specific high, left-side target.
           I need to find a position within 2 units of the target. This limits the x range to roughly [-2.5, 0.0] and y range to roughly [-0.1, 2.5].
           
           Strategy: The target is in the upper left corner. All my previous attempts from below and slightly to the right failed line-of-sight. This suggests there are objects between those points and the target. This means I should try to move *around* the target, or find a very clear line of sight.
           
           Given the failures, it seems like the best approach is to try positions that are:
           a) Further to the left and slightly below the target, to get a wider angle.
           b) Directly to the left of the target, if possible, but not in the narrow channel of the corner.
           
           Let's try to place the robot further left and slightly below the target.
           Target: (-2.1157, 1.8638)
           
           1.  **Directly left, but slightly forward (positive y).**
               Base: (-2.4, 1.0).
               Distance from target: sqrt((-2.4 - -2.1157)^2 + (1.0 - 1.8638)^2) = sqrt((-0.2843)^2 + (-0.8638)^2) = sqrt(0.0808 + 0.7461) = sqrt(0.8269) = 0.909. Within max_range.
               This position is very close to the left wall (AABB 4) but stays within x_limit. It should give a wide view of the target from the side.
           
           2.  **Slightly below and slightly to the left.** This could help avoid obstacles around y=1.5 that might be blocking the view.
               Base: (-2.3, 0.7).
               Distance from target: sqrt((-2.3 - -2.1157)^2 + (0.7 - 1.8638)^2) = sqrt((-0.1843)^2 + (-1.1638)^2) = sqrt(0.0340 + 1.3544) = sqrt(1.3884) = 1.178. Within max_range.
               This is also closer to the left wall, but has a larger y offset from the target.
           
           3.  **Further to the right, but still keeping x negative and significantly away from the central wall.** This time, I'll aim for a y that is much lower, hoping to clear any lower-mid obstacles.
               Base: (-0.5, 0.2).
               Distance from target: sqrt((-0.5 - -2.1157)^2 + (0.2 - 1.8638)^2) = sqrt((1.6157)^2 + (-1.6638)^2) = sqrt(2.6105 + 2.7682) = sqrt(5.3787) = 2.319. This is out of range! My previous calculation was wrong. Max range is 2.
           
               Let's recalculate for a point within range, but still trying to be significantly to the right and low.
               Target: (-2.1157, 1.8638)
               Let's try x = -1.0, y = 0.8.
               Distance from target: sqrt((-1.0 - -2.1157)^2 + (0.8 - 1.8638)^2) = sqrt((1.1157)^2 + (-1.0638)^2) = sqrt(1.2447 + 1.1316) = sqrt(2.3763) = 1.541. This is within max_range.
               This position is further to the right and lower than the target. It's to the left of AABB 5 and should avoid AABB 17 and 10.
           
           Positions:
           (-2.4 1.0)
           (-2.3 0.7)
           (-1.0 0.8)

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     My previous attempts continue to fail, providing valuable negative examples.
           
           Let's summarize past failures for target (-2.1157, 1.8638):
           *   (-2.0, 1.4533): no line of sight. (Likely AABB 8 or 20)
           *   (-0.9757, 0.0): no line of sight. (Likely AABB 17, 18, 14, or 6)
           *   (-0.2, 1.0): collision with AABB 5 (central wall).
           
           And for the new target (-0.45329713821411133, 1.8977816104888916):
           *   (-2.4, 1.0): collision with AABB 4 (left wall). This is a clear boundary violation. My x-coordinate was too small. The left wall is at x = -2.45.
           *   (-2.3, 0.7): collision with AABB 4 (left wall). Again, too far left.
           
           My last successful position for the *previous* request was (-1.0, 0.8), but I was not given feedback on it for the previous target. However, since the target changed, I will consider it for the new target.
           
           The new target point is (-0.45329713821411133, 1.8977816104888916). This target is in the upper middle-left region, very close to AABB 10 ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)), AABB 19 ((-0.49, 1.85), (-0.41, 1.93)), and AABB 21 ((0.28, 1.90), (0.36, 1.99)). It is also quite close to the central wall (AABB 5).
           
           I need to find 3 positions within 2 units of this target, avoiding collisions and occlusions. The x-range for the robot is [-2.5, 2.5] and y-range is [-2.5, 2.5]. Max distance is 2.
           
           Considering the target is at x=-0.45, y=1.89:
           *   I cannot go further left than -2.45 (AABB 4).
           *   I cannot go right of -0.05 (AABB 5) if I want to stay on this side of the wall.
           *   Obstacles 10 and 19 are very close to the target, so approaching from directly below or from the sides could be blocked.
           
           Strategy:
           1.  **Directly below the target, at a safe distance from other obstacles.**
               Target: (-0.453, 1.897)
               Let's try a point below and slightly to the left, away from the central obstacle.
               Base: (-1.0, 0.5).
               Distance: sqrt((-1.0 - -0.453)^2 + (0.5 - 1.897)^2) = sqrt((-0.547)^2 + (-1.397)^2) = sqrt(0.299 + 1.951) = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5. This is within max_range.
               This position is far enough from the left wall and the central wall. It's below obstacles 10 and 19.
           
           2.  **To the far left of the target, avoiding AABB 4.**
               Let's try to place it at x = -2.0. This is to the left of most obstacles around the target, but not too close to the wall.
               Base: (-2.0, 1.0).
               Distance: sqrt((-2.0 - -0.453)^2 + (1.0 - 1.897)^2) = sqrt((-1.547)^2 + (-0.897)^2) = sqrt(2.393 + 0.804) = sqrt(3.197) = 1.788. This is within max_range.
               This position could have line of sight as it's far to the left of the immediate obstacles around the target.
           
           3.  **Slightly to the right of the target (but still left of the central wall) and below.**
               This is a tricky spot due to AABB 5 (x=-0.05). I need to be careful not to collide.
               Let's try x=-0.15. This is slightly to the right of the target's x, but still clear of the wall.
               Base: (-0.15, 1.0).
               Distance: sqrt((-0.15 - -0.453)^2 + (1.0 - 1.897)^2) = sqrt((0.303)^2 + (-0.897)^2) = sqrt(0.0918 + 0.8046) = sqrt(0.8964) = 0.946. This is well within max_range.
               This position is to the left of AABB 5, but close to it. It's below AABB 10, 19, 21.
           
           Positions:
           (-1.0 0.5)
           (-2.0 1.0)
           (-0.15 1.0)

           Summary of failures:
           1.  **Target (-2.1157, 1.8638):**
               *   (-2.0, 1.4533): No line of sight.
               *   (-0.9757, 0.0): No line of sight.
               *   (-0.2, 1.0): Collision with AABB 5 (central wall).
           
           2.  **Target (-0.453, 1.897):**
               *   (-2.4, 1.0): Collision with AABB 4 (left wall).
               *   (-2.3, 0.7): Collision with AABB 4 (left wall).
           
           3.  **Target (0.3266, 1.9517):**
               *   (-1.0, 0.5): No line of sight. This is a significant point. This target is on the *right* side of the central wall (AABB 5), but my proposed position was on the *left* side. The central wall definitely blocks the view.
               *   (-2.0, 1.0): No line of sight. Same reasoning as above, the central wall (AABB 5) would block the view.
               *   (-0.15, 1.0): Collision with AABB 5 (central wall). My attempt to hug the wall was too close.
           
           This new target point (0.32662197947502136, 1.9516992568969727) is crucial. It is in the upper right quadrant, *to the right of the central wall AABB 5*. This means all previous positions on the left side of the wall are guaranteed to fail due to occlusion or collision. This clarifies a lot!
           
           I need to find 3 positions within 2 units of this target, avoiding collisions and occlusions.
           Target: (0.3266, 1.9517)
           Max range = 2.
           x-range for robot is [-2.5, 2.5], y-range is [-2.5, 2.5].
           
           Since the target is to the right of AABB 5, all my proposed positions should have an x-coordinate > 0.05.
           
           Obstacles near target (0.3266, 1.9517):
           *   AABB 9 ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)): This obstacle is directly around the target.
           *   AABB 21 ((0.28, 1.90), (0.36, 1.99)): This obstacle is very close to the target, almost overlapping.
           *   AABB 15 ((0.17, 1.20), (0.30, 1.34)): Below and slightly to the left.
           
           Strategy:
           1.  **Directly below the target, at a safe distance.** This avoids the central wall and potentially AABB 9 and 21.
               Base: (0.3, 0.5).
               Distance from target: sqrt((0.3 - 0.3266)^2 + (0.5 - 1.9517)^2) = sqrt((-0.0266)^2 + (-1.4517)^2) = sqrt(0.0007 + 2.1074) = sqrt(2.1081) = 1.4519. Within max_range.
               This position is clear of AABB 5. It's below AABB 9, 21, and 15.
           
           2.  **To the right of the target, but not too close to the right wall.**
               Base: (1.5, 1.5).
               Distance from target: sqrt((1.5 - 0.3266)^2 + (1.5 - 1.9517)^2) = sqrt((1.1734)^2 + (-0.4517)^2) = sqrt(1.3768 + 0.2040) = sqrt(1.5808) = 1.257. Within max_range.
               This position is to the right of AABB 9 and 21. It's also clear of AABB 5. It should avoid AABB 7 (top right) if the y is kept lower than 1.75.
           
           3.  **Below and to the right of the target.**
               Base: (1.0, 0.0).
               Distance from target: sqrt((1.0 - 0.3266)^2 + (0.0 - 1.9517)^2) = sqrt((0.6734)^2 + (-1.9517)^2) = sqrt(0.4534 + 3.8091) = sqrt(4.2625) = 2.064. This is *just* outside the max range of 2.
           
               Let's adjust it to be closer.
               Base: (1.0, 0.5).
               Distance from target: sqrt((1.0 - 0.3266)^2 + (0.5 - 1.9517)^2) = sqrt((0.6734)^2 + (-1.4517)^2) = sqrt(0.4534 + 2.1074) = sqrt(2.5608) = 1.600. Within max_range.
               This position is clear of AABB 5. It's also clear of AABB 13 and 16.
           
           Positions:
           (0.3 0.5)
           (1.5 1.5)
           (1.0 0.5)
