User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a vertical obstacle (obstacle 5) at x = 0, running from y = -2.5 to y = 2.5, effectively dividing the space into two halves. There are also several smaller rectangular obstacles scattered throughout the environment, many of which are near the walls or corners. Obstacles 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 are smaller, more localized blocks.
           
           My strategy will be to generate points that are within a 2 unit radius of the target point. I will prioritize points that are not directly behind the central obstacle (obstacle 5) relative to the target, and avoid placing the robot too close to any known obstacles. I will also try to keep a diverse set of positions around the target.
           
           For target_point = (-1.018155 0.534882):
           
           The target is in the left half of the environment. I will focus on placing the robot in this half as well to avoid occlusions from the central wall (obstacle 5).
           
           1.  A position to the right and slightly below the target, keeping clear of obstacle 11 and 12.
           2.  A position to the left and slightly below the target, away from obstacle 12.
           3.  A position above and slightly to the right of the target, avoiding obstacles 8, 11, and 19.
           
           Positions:
           (-0.018155 0.034882)
           (-2.018155 0.034882)
           (-1.018155 1.534882)
