           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           Atom stackable(v12, v18)

           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Evaluation: Goal Unreachable**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to ensuring an object is *on v18* and has a specific *type (v17)*. My initial thought is to analyze the initial state and figure out how to get either `v8` or `v12` (the two objects with the required type) onto `v18`.
           
           My understanding of the `on` predicate tells me that an object is "on" another if it's *supported* at a certain *pose*. So, I need to find a *pose* where `v8` or `v12` is supported by `v18`.
           
           I start by checking the initial state for any existing supports on `v18`. I see potential support for both `v8` and `v12` by `v18`. However, I cannot pick or place any objects due to an issue with the allowed action instances, which is restricted to a useless `move_base` action.
           
           Since I can't *pick* up and *place* objects, I can't move either `v8` or `v12` onto `v18`. My plan quickly stalls because the actions I need to manipulate the `on` predicate are unavailable.
           
           Even considering other available actions `clean` and `cook` does not change the fact that I am stuck. Given the constrained action space, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently *unreachable*. No object of type v17 can be put on v18.
