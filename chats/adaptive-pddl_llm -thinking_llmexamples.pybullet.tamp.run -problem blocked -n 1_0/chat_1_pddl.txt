           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Goal and Constraints**
           
           My task is to formulate a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to placing an object of type `v17` onto object `v18`.  Objects `v8` and `v12` are of type `v17`. To achieve the goal I must make either `v8` or `v12` `on v18`.  `on` is defined by `supported` and `atpose`, meaning the object must be supported by and at a specific pose above the target.
           
           I analyzed the initial state and noticed that the robot could achieve the goal for either `v8` or `v12`. Importantly, there are `supported` facts that enable the goal with respect to `v8` and `v12` placed above object `#o2`.
           
           **Plan Formation - First Attempt**
           
           My initial plan was to move `v8` to `#o2`. I planned to pick up `v8` using the robot's arm (v4) and place it at pose `#o2`. This involved using the actions `pick` and `place`, with certain base configuration and grasp parameters. I considered the relevant `kin` facts and pre-conditions. However, the problem statement provides a severely constrained set of allowed actions, just `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.
           
           **Unreachable Goal**
           
           The restriction to only `move_base` actions is a fatal limitation. Since `pick` and `place` are not in the valid actions list, I cannot move objects to new poses. Therefore, the goal cannot be achieved. The only possible action, `move_base`, has no effect on the `atpose` relations, so it is impossible to satisfy the `on` constraint and consequently, `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable.
