           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.
           
           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q0', '#t1'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q0', '#q1', '#t3'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', '#p0', '#g0', '#q1', '#t2'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-traj-pose:('#t0', 'v15', 'v16')->()`, which impeded executing the action pick('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0').
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Goal Reachability for `new-axiom@0()` in `pr2-tamp` Domain**
           
           My primary objective is to develop a plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()` within the `pr2-tamp` domain. This goal is contingent upon the `Axiom new-axiom@0()`, demanding the placement of an object of a particular type (`v17`) onto `v18`. Upon reviewing the initial state, I identify two potential candidates for this object: `v8` and `v12`, both of type `v17`. For this analysis, I will proceed with `v8`.
           
           The overarching goal now is to establish `on(v8, v18)`. Achieving this necessitates satisfying the `on` axiom, which requires `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` to be true for some pose `?p`, along with `atpose(v8, ?p)`. Examination of the supported facts indicates that `v8` can be supported on `v18` at pose `#o2`.
           
           This sets the framework for the initial plan: move `v8` to pose `#o2` on `v18`. The present state indicates `atpose(v8, v9)`, implying a change in position is required. Therefore, the strategic approach involves two key actions: (1) pick `v8` from its current pose `v9`, and (2) place `v8` onto `v18` at pose `#o2`.
           
           Upon assessing the available actions, it becomes apparent that the success of these actions is heavily predicated on specific preconditions. The move requires the robot to change pose to `#o3`, so I must use `move_base(v3, #o3, #o0)`, which seems ok.
           
           I have already determined `move_base` actions can move the base, and `pick` and `place` actions would manipulate the object.
           
           I need to confirm the conditions for the `pick` action: specifically, `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)` must be met. However, it seems to be in conflict with the current scene setup. The definition of `new-axiom@0(?o)` requires that there can't be any other graspable object. Since objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v15` are graspable, it's impossible to pick any one of them.
           
           Here lies the critical issue: the action `pick` depends on a precondition that is, as currently defined, impossible to satisfy in the initial state given multiple graspable objects. Thus the goal is unachievable with these given constraints.
