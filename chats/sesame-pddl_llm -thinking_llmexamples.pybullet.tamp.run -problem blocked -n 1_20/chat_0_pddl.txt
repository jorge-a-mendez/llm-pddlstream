           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`. Examining the problem description, it appears there are two identical definitions for `new-axiom@0()`, which I'll treat as a single objective: to satisfy the conjunction of `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.
           
           **Candidate Identification and Predicate Analysis**
           
           First, I identified potential candidates for the `?green` object. Inspecting the initial state, I found that both `v8` and `v12` have the required type. I chose `v8` as my initial target, meaning I needed to ensure `v8` is on `v18`. To satisfy the `on` predicate, an object must be supported at a certain pose.  In the initial state, `v8` is at `v9` and supported by `v11`, but there's a supporting predicate that allows `v8` to be on `v18` at `v9`.
           
           **Action Selection and Precondition Verification**
           
           This leads to my plan: move the robot base to `#o3`, pick `v8` from its current pose, and place it at `#o2` on `v18`.  
           
           **Action 1: Move Base**
           To facilitate this, I needed to perform a move base action from base configuration `v3` to `#o3`.
           *   **Preconditions:** `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)` (motion from v3 to #o3 exists), `atbconf(v3)`(base at v3), `canmove()`(robot is allowed to move).
           *   **Effects:** The robot is now at base configuration `#o3`.
           
           **Action 2: Pick**
           This action requires using the robot arm to pick `v8`.
           *   **Preconditions:** `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)` (arm can grasp v8), `atpose(v8, v9)`(v8 is at pose v9), `handempty(v4)`(robot has no item),  `atbconf(#o3)`(robot at configured base), no unsafe predicates.
           *   **Effects:** The arm holds v8 at grasp position #o1, robot now cannot move, and the object is no longer at the pose.
           
           **Action 3: Place**
           *   **Preconditions:** Similar `kin` predicate but for placing, object must be held in the robot's arm, the robot must be at the correct base configuration, and no unsafe predicates.
           *   **Effects:** The object is now at its destination pose and is no longer held by the robot arm, robot is capable to move and is no longer at v9.
           
           **Goal Verification**
           
           Finally, I confirmed that after executing these actions, the `on(v8, v18)` and `type(v8, v17)` goals would be satisfied, thus achieving `new-axiom@0()`. Furthermore, it seems I could have achieved a goal by re-picking from `v12`, the plan still holds valid.
