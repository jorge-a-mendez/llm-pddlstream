           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **My objective is to identify 50 stable and distinct placements for an object, which has x and y dimensions of approximately 0.07, on a given surface (surface 0, defined by the points (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0)).** A placement is considered stable if the object is entirely contained within the surface boundaries, and I account for rotations by varying the angle `theta`.
           
           To start, I analyze surface 0, calculating its width and height (both 0.6). I note that the object's small dimensions, relative to the surface's, should provide ample placement space.
           
           Since I need multiple placements, I'll systematically vary the rotation angle (`theta`) and the object's center position within the surface. I decide to use 10 different angles, ranging from 0 to 2*pi, with equal spacing. For each angle, I need to ensure that the rotated object remains entirely within the surface.
           
           I'll calculate the new axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) dimensions, using:
           `new_size_x = abs(object_size_x * cos(theta)) + abs(object_size_y * sin(theta))`
           `new_size_y = abs(object_size_x * sin(theta)) + abs(object_size_y * cos(theta))`
           Then I determine the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates for the *object's center*, for each angle. The object must remain entirely contained within the bounding box defined by the surface bounds.
           
           Within each "safe zone", I'll place the object at four corners and the center position (for each angle). Specifically, I compute the valid rectangle within which the object's center must lie: this is defined by `surface_lower_x + new_size_x / 2`, etc.
           I then compute the center of this valid placement rectangle using the average of the coordinates of its two corners. The placements are recorded as (surface index, rotation angle, x, y) tuples. This systematically creates 50 diverse placements.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 10**
           
           My objective here is to generate 50 stable placements for object ID 10 on surface 0.  I've received some feedback on a previous object (ID 5), but it's not directly relevant since this is a new object and there are no existing objects to avoid collisions with yet.
           
           The object is a square of size `0.0907 x 0.0907`, and the surface is defined by the bounds (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0). I'll calculate rotations around `10` angles between 0 and 2*pi, each multiplied by `i`, with `i` from `0` to `9`. For each rotation, I need to compute the rotated bounding box (AABB) of the square, then place the object to the specified criteria.
           
           Since the object is almost a perfect square, I can simplify the AABB calculation. The maximum extent of the rotated object will be when it's rotated by pi/4 (or its multiples), while the minimum extent will be when the object is at multiples of pi/2. I'll need to define a function to compute the rotated AABB extents. After these extents are known, I need to place the object such that it won't exceed the surface boundaries.
           
           I'll iterate through each rotation angle, calculate the AABB's new size, then determine the valid center ranges. I will pick 5 positions per rotation. Finally, I will return `50` placements, composed of the object ID, the angle of rotation, and the `x` and `y` coordinates of the center point for each placement.
