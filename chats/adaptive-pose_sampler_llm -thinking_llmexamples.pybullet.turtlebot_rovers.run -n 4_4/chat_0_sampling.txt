(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Candidate Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, here's what I've got. The task is to find three safe base positions for a robot, within 2 meters of the target (0.1, -0.1), while avoiding obstacles and ensuring line-of-sight. The robot's x and y coordinates are limited to [-2.5, 2.5], and its orientation will be automatically set to face the target. The key is to account for that central wall at x=0, which means the robot needs to be on the right side (x > 0.05) to see the target.
           
           First, I looked at the AABBs to understand the scene. There's a big square representing the environment (walls), a vertical wall at x=0 (the central one), and several smaller obstacles scattered around. The target is at (0.1, -0.1), meaning the robot *must* be on the right side of the central wall to have a clear path to it.
           
           I then considered the constraints:
           1.  x > 0.05
           2.  |distance to target| <= 2
           3.  No collisions.
           4.  Clear line-of-sight.
           
           Since the target (0.1, -0.1) is on the right side of the x=0 wall, the robot's x must also be on the right side.
           
           To find these positions, I need to stay within a circle of radius 2 centered at the target (0.1, -0.1). This limits the x and y coordinates I can use. I intersected those ranges with the navigable space bounds for x > 0.05.
           
           The most critical obstacle is a small one, ((0.1223, -0.0423), (0.2299, 0.0651)), right near the target. Line-of-sight analysis showed a small obstacle could cause an issue here. I needed to pick points around the circle in a smart way. I chose a radius of 1.5, to be safe.
           
           Here are the selected points:
           
           1.  **(1.6, -0.1)**: Directly to the right of the target.
               I checked that it meets all criteria: within the range, no collisions, and clear line-of-sight.
           2.  **(1.16, -1.16)**: To the bottom-right.
               I calculated this position, and line of sight is clear from here as well. No issues.
           3.  **(0.1, 1.4)**: Directly above the target.
               Line of sight here is also clear, despite the close-by obstacle. The x-coordinate = 0.1 is to the left of the closest wall of that obstacle, and therefore not an issue.
           
           Each of these positions is on the right of the central wall. They're all close enough, well within bounds. I checked them all to ensure no collisions. My reasoning looked solid. Now, based on everything, these three should work and allow clear paths to the target!

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning for the New Request**
           
           Okay, so I got some crucial feedback on my last attempt. Turns out I was looking at the wrong target point, which led me down the wrong path entirely. That previous target was `(0.1, -0.1)` and I was looking at `(-0.5036, 2.1077)`. A classic rookie mistake! That meant my obstacle analysis and line-of-sight calculations were all over the place. I learned from that to double-check my input data and verify the target I'm trying to address.
           
           So, let's start fresh. The new target point is `(0.395, -0.091)`, which puts it in the bottom-right quadrant. The important thing to note is that its *x*-coordinate (0.395) is greater than 0.05, which is the right side of the central vertical wall (Obstacle 5). My robot's base will have to have an *x*-coordinate that is also greater than 0.05 to avoid being blocked by that wall.
           
           I considered a maximum distance of 2 meters from the target and the key obstacles in this area include Obstacle 14, and the dimensions of the central wall.
           
           Given the target’s location and the constraint of line-of-sight, the most suitable positions for the robot base are: `(1.895, -0.091)` directly to the right, `(1.455, -1.151)` bottom-right, and `(1.455, 0.969)` top-right.
           I validated these positions by ensuring the robot base could see the target, within the 2-meter max distance constraint, and outside the central wall. I also check for occlusion by other obstacles.

(Thoughts: **Initial Analysis and Obstacle Identification**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a new target point: `(-2.099591016769409, 1.8731794357299805)`, which I'm approximating as `(-2.1, 1.87)`. I need to generate three new positions for the robot base. I'm also given a list of previous failures, which is helpful to understand the constraints.
           
           I immediately notice the target is in the left half of the room (x < -0.05), so any valid robot base position must also be in the left half to avoid the central wall, which has caused previous issues.
           
           **Problematic Obstacles and Target Location**
           
           Now, here's where it gets interesting. I've pinpointed that the target itself seems to be *inside* several fixed obstacles, specifically obstacle 8 `((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25))` and obstacle 19 `((-2.1449, 1.8277), (-2.0542, 1.9185))`. The target point's coordinates place it *within* the boundaries of these obstacles.  This is a significant problem because "line of sight" usually implies an unobstructed path. If the target is embedded within an opaque obstacle, how can a robot *see* it? This usually results in a non-feasible location.
           
           **Interpreting "Line of Sight" and Formulating a Strategy**
           
           Given the "never give up" instruction, I'm forced to assume some flexibility in the "line of sight" definition. I have to interpret it as, the straight line segment from robot to target *must not intersect any *other* fixed obstacle*, so I should select positions close to the target, as long as it's not colliding with the walls that would obstruct the line of sight (even though the target sits within one, which would block that same "line of sight").
           
           I have to find robot positions that are within a `max_range = 2` distance from `(-2.1, 1.87)`, and must ensure `x < -0.05` to be on the correct side of the central wall.
           
           **Proposed Positions and Justification**
           
           Since I'm forced to generate some positions, I'm assuming that the robot base cannot collide with the *boundaries* of obstacle 8 and 19.  I'll place the robot position right near these bounds.
           
           1.  **`(-2.3, 1.6)`**:  The robot is to the left and below obstacle 8. The path *will* pass into the rectangular bounding boxes for the target, but not any other obstacle in the path to the target. This location is outside obstacles 8 and 19.
           2.  **`(-1.7, 1.87)`**: The robot position is to the right of obstacle 8 and along its height (same y-coordinate as the target).  It's also outside the other boundary near the target, 19.
           3.  **`(-2.1, 2.3)`**: The robot position is above obstacle 8 and in line with obstacle 19 (which is smaller, near the target).
           
           These proposed positions are the best I can do, given the constraints.  I've made the key assumption that line of sight is clear if no other fixed obstacles are intersected, despite the target being within an occluding object. If all three positions are rejected as bad paths, it would further reinforce that a target within a fixed obstacle is *not* accessible.

(Thoughts: **Final Thoughts: Navigating the Obstacles**
           
           Okay, so I've got this target point, (0.693, 1.819), and I need three robot base positions to see it.  The main thing is that the target is in the right half of the room (x > 0.05), so my base positions *must* be there too to have a clear line of sight. I've also learned from past failures, which is handy.
           
           **Obstacle Analysis:** I've got a central wall at x=0 (Obstacle 5), and a bunch of other blocks scattered around.  Crucially, the target is *inside* two obstacles (9 and 20), which throws a wrench in the "no-obstruction" rule.  I'm going with the assumption that line-of-sight means the robot base can't collide, and the view can't be obstructed by other obstacles, but the occlusion by the containing-target obstacle is permissible.
           
           **Candidate Selection:** I've focused on areas where I can place the robot without bumping into anything and ensure that the line of sight doesn't pass through other blocks (beyond the one containing the target). I came up with three distinct options:
           
           1.  **(1.5, 1.819):**  To the right of the target (so x > 0.75), and in line with its y-coordinate. It avoids all obstacles. A horizontal line connects it to the target, passing through obstacles 9 and 20 (both containing the target).  This is good.
           2.  **(1.0, 1.0):** Down and to the right of the target (again, well into the right half of the room).  The sight line slopes, but clears all obstacles.
           3.  **(0.1, 0.5):** Down and to the left of the target, *just* to the right of the central wall.  This position also looks good, with a diagonal view line clearing all the other obstructions.
           
           **Final Verdict:** I’m confident in these three positions. All are within range (2 meters), are in the right half of the room, and avoid any collisions (base or line-of-sight obstruction) that I could discern. Time to send them and see what happens!

(Thoughts: **Strategic Repositioning: Navigating Obstacles and Avoiding Recurrent Line-of-Sight Conflicts**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. We've got a new target point, `(1.881, 2.004)`, and a history of near misses. The key here is to generate three new robot base positions that are within a 2-meter radius of the target, avoid collisions with any *fixed* obstacles (fixed meaning they don't move), and maintain a clear line of sight to the target. Seems simple enough, but there's a recurring issue, and that's the pesky obstacle 18, `((1.217, 1.656), (1.358, 1.797))`.
           
           Here's the situation: my prior attempts have flagged line-of-sight collisions with obstacle 18, even when my geometric calculations suggest otherwise. This tells me I'm missing something, a "fuzziness" to the collision detection. It seems there's a margin of error that I need to account for.
           
           Given the target's position in the top-right quadrant, my main strategy is going to be to:
           
           1. **Avoid Obstacle 18 Completely**: The recurring failures with this obstacle are my top priority. I'm going to ensure the *entire* line of sight from the base to the target avoids any x-range overlap with obstacle 18.
           2. **Account for Obstacle 7 & 21**: Since the target itself is within obstacles 7 and 21, it is expected that the line of sight passes through these to connect to the target. These can be ignored.
           3. **General Considerations**: All positions must have an x-coordinate greater than 0.05 to avoid the central dividing wall.
           
           Based on this, my final solution is:
           
           1.  **(2.381, 2.004)**: Directly to the right of the target.
           2.  **(2.3, 0.6)**: Further to the right and low.
           3.  **(1.6, 1.0)**: Also far to the right.
           
           These positions should satisfy the criteria while remaining clear of any conflict with the mysterious obstacle 18.
