           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Configuration Constraints**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: `new-axiom@0()`. Breaking it down, I need to achieve both `receivedimage` predicates for three objectives and `receivedanalysis` for a rock and soil sample.  The initial state provides some relevant facts: the rovers are at configurations v13 and v15, and they have cameras and communication capabilities. I see some "imagevisible", "comvisible", and "above" predicates setting up the relationships for imaging, communication, and sampling, respectively. These use configurations `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5`. But here's the kicker: the necessary *actions* - calibrate, take_image, send_image, sample_rock, and send_analysis - all have the precondition `atconf(?v, ?q)`. The problem is that the only "move" actions I'm allowed to use just keep the rovers at their current configurations (v13 and v15). I don't have *any* actions that let me move from v13 or v15 to the configurations needed for imaging, communication, and sampling (`#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5`). So, even though I have the visible relationships, the rovers are stuck at the wrong locations to *use* them. Since the actions can't be executed, I cannot fulfill the goal conditions. It appears the constraints of the allowable actions render the objective unattainable. I would flag this as an unachievable goal given the current restrictions.
