           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Feasibility of Achieving the Goal**
           
           My primary goal is to determine a plan to fulfill the requirements of `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom necessitates specific conditions, including having received images (`receivedimage`) of three objectives (v17, v18, and v19) and received analyses (`receivedanalysis`) for a stone and a soil sample. However, upon scrutinizing the available actions, I've hit a critical roadblock.
           
           My initial analysis focused on a typical approach, which is: I broke down the goal into individual steps that involve taking images (using actions like `calibrate` and `take_image`), sending images (using `send_image`), taking soil samples (using actions such as `sample_rock`), and sending analyses (using `send_analysis`). I planned to use rover v12 to take pictures of the objectives v17, v18, and v19. Then I planned to take samples from stone v1 and soil v5. Then send these analyses to the lander v9. 
           
           Unfortunately, my planning was halted by a specific constraint.
           The problem statement restricts me to using only four predefined action instances: `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`, `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`, `(drop_rock v12 v16)`, and `(drop_rock v14 v16)`.  The problem description is very specific, using the language "the list of available action instances is". This implies that I am strictly limited to using these very concrete actions, and not their more general types, such as `move` or `drop_rock`.
           
           The core issue lies in the fact that achieving the desired predicates (`receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`) requires actions (`send_image` and `send_analysis`) that are not included in the list of available action instances.  Therefore, it is logically impossible to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()` given this restricted action set.
           
           In short, given the rigid action constraints, the plan is unachievable, and the initial goal remains unattainable.
