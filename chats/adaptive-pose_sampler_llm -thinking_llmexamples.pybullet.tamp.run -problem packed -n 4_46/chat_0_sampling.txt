           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Here's how I'm thinking about this:**
           
           Okay, I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 4 on a surface. The object is defined by its AABB (0.084, 0.084) and the surface is a simple AABB from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           First, I need to figure out the valid region for placing the object.  The key is making sure the object's AABB stays completely within the surface's AABB.  I'll start by calculating the half-extents of the object (0.042, 0.042). Then, I'll determine the valid range for the object's center (x, y) coordinates based on the surface's bounds. This involves shifting the surface boundaries by the object's half-extents to get the inner "safe zone".
           
           My crucial assumption here is that the *effective* AABB of the object remains constant regardless of its rotation. The problem states that the geometry of the object will be described in terms of its AABB. I'm taking this to mean that the provided size is the *maximum* AABB, which doesn't change when rotated.  If I rotated a square, the *actual* bounding box would increase unless rotated by 90 degrees. If it weren't fixed, I'd need to recompute the extents each time, which would be unnecessary given the way it's framed.
           
           So, I've calculated the valid x and y ranges. Now I need to generate 50 distinct (x, y) coordinates within this region. I'll make a nice grid distribution using 8 steps for x and 7 for y. This covers the valid region and gives me 56 points, and I can then just take the first 50.
           
           For the orientation (theta), I'll make it diverse. For the actual stability check, it doesn't matter, because I'm assuming the bounding box is fixed. But I'll use a variety of values to show different orientations for visual variety, and to test that.  This includes a cyclic pattern of rotations to show diversity.
           
           I now have a clear plan: calculate valid range, generate a grid of x/y values, assign theta values, and iterate to fill the array with 50 tuples.

(Thoughts: **My Strategic Approach to Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. I've successfully placed Object 4. Now, I need to find 50 stable positions for Object 5 on the same surface, making sure it doesn't collide with Object 4.  Here's the breakdown of my thinking:
           
           1.  **Define the Problem:** I know Object 5's dimensions and the surface boundaries. The surface is defined by its minimum and maximum x and y values. I've already calculated the allowed range for Object 5's center on the surface, considering its own dimensions (half-extents) and the surface bounds.
           
           2.  **Obstacle Avoidance:** Object 4 is already positioned. I know Object 4's center and dimensions (half-extents). To avoid a collision, I need to keep Object 5's center outside a specific "no-go" zone defined by Object 4's position and size.
           
           3.  **Collision Detection:** I'm using a standard AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) collision detection approach.  The formula is simple: two AABBs collide if the absolute difference in their centers is less than the sum of their half-extents along each axis.  I will apply this to Object 4 and Object 5.
           
           4.  **No-Go Zone Calculation:** Based on the collision detection, I've calculated the exact boundaries of the no-go zone within the surface for Object 5. It's essentially a square around Object 4.
           
           5.  **Generating Valid Placements:** Now comes the clever part. I will generate a grid of potential placements for Object 5 within the surface bounds. For each point in this grid, I'll check if it falls within the no-go zone. If it doesn't, that's a valid placement! I'm planning to use a slightly more refined grid to ensure I thoroughly scan for potential stable placements. I will generate a total of 12 by 12 points for this search.
           
           6.  **Angle Variation:** To make it interesting, I'll rotate Object 5. For each valid placement, I will select an angle from my pre-defined list. The result will be 50 tuples (surf\_idx, theta, x, y).

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Avoiding Collisions and Surface Constraints**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with finding 50 stable positions for a new object (ID 7) on a given surface, while making sure it doesn't collide with two already-placed objects (ID 4 and ID 5).  The surface is a rectangle, and the new object's dimensions are also rectangular. My goal is to determine a grid of valid center coordinates (x7_c, y7_c) for the new object.
           
           First, I need to define the valid placement range based on the surface constraints.  Object 7's center can only be within a certain rectangular area on the surface, which I've calculated based on the surface's dimensions and the object's half-extents.  This gives me the allowable ranges for x7_c and y7_c.
           
           Next, I have to account for the collisions. Object 4 is already in position. To prevent overlaps, I have to ensure that object 7's center does not fall within a bounding box centered on object 4. The same applies for Object 5. I calculate these "no-go zones" (areas where object 7's center cannot be) based on the sum of object half-extents.
           
           To ensure efficient search and placement of the new object, I will define three different sub-regions in the surface. Then, I will generate a grid of candidate center coordinates, and check for validity. Points within the collision zones are to be avoided by design.

(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to find 50 stable, collision-free placements for object ID 6 on surface 0. I've got the dimensions of the object (about 0.09 units on each side) and the surface boundaries: an AABB from roughly -0.135 to 0.135 in both X and Y. I've also got the positions of three other objects (IDs 4, 5, and 7) already placed on the surface. Now, I need to methodically identify valid locations.
           
           First, I need to ensure that the center of object 6 stays within the surface's boundaries. Since the object's half-extents are about 0.0459, the center's X and Y coordinates must be in the range of roughly -0.089 to 0.089. This defines the valid region for the object's center.
           
           Next comes the crucial collision detection.  I need to consider the overlap between object 6 and the existing objects (4, 5, and 7). I've calculated the "no-go zones" for object 6, based on the dimensions and positions of the existing objects. The key is to calculate the bounding boxes created by placing object 6, and checking their intersection. Specifically,  the collision condition for a pair of objects is a conjunction of `abs(x6_c - xi_c) < (h6_x + hi_x)` and `abs(y6_c - yi_c) < (h6_y + hi_y)`
           
           Object 4 has a collision zone in the bottom-left corner and Object 5 covers a large collision zone covering the bottom-left of the valid region, extending upwards. Object 7 has a collision zone extending along the bottom of the valid region.
           
           Given these collision regions, the strategy is to iterate through a grid of potential center points for object 6. For each point, I check for overlap with the "no-go zones" using the collision criteria. If a point doesn't collide with any of the existing objects, it's considered valid. Finally, I add the point with a specific angle from a set of angles, for each valid point. I'll continue generating points until I have a set of 50 valid placements.
           
           To be precise, I set up a 15x15 grid of points within the valid surface range and I check the collision with each point. If the point does not collide with existing placed objects, I add the point and a rotating angle to a list of valid points. Once 50 valid placements have been found, the algorithm is complete.
