           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Alright, here's my plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`:**
           
           First, I need to understand what this means.  `new-axiom@0()` is a conjunction of two atoms: `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.  I need to make both of these true.
           
           Looking at the initial state, I see I already have two objects, `v8` and `v12`, that are `type(v_x, v17)`. My strategy is to place one of these objects onto `v18`. 
           
           The core of the problem then becomes how to achieve `on(?green, v18)`. I understand from the problem definition `on(?o, ?r)` is an axiom defined as `supported(?o, ?p, ?r) AND atpose(?o, ?p)`.
           
           Looking further, I see that both `v8` and `v12` already have poses and are supported by other objects.
           
           Now, my goal is to pick `v8`, move it, and place it so `on(v8, v18)` is true. I examine the actions available to me, the conditions required to take those actions, and how these actions will affect my current understanding of the initial state. I will use the `move_base` action followed by the `pick` and `place` actions. I am carefully monitoring the preconditions of each action and what needs to be made true by the previous actions and the state variables.
           
           First, I will **move the robot's base** to a suitable pose.
           
           Next, I need to **pick up `v8`**. This is a straightforward action, since I am confident that `v8` is in hand, and the preconditions, like the arm being empty and `atbconf(#o3)` being true, are fulfilled.
           
           Finally, I need to **place `v8` on `v18`**.  The place action requires the arm to have a grasp, and for the robot's configuration `atbconf(#o3)` to be true, all of which are met. I confirm this action by evaluating the supporting predicates, `atpose` and `supported`, to satisfy `on(?green, v18)`.
           
           After this, `on(v8, v18)` will be true. Since `type(v8, v17)` is already true in the initial state, I will have achieved my goal!
           
           I've carefully double-checked all the preconditions, action effects, and object relations to ensure that this plan is sound and complete.
