           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Analysis and Unreachability**
           
           I'm tasked with devising a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()` in the `pr2-tamp` domain. This goal translates to placing an object, let's call it `v12`, on another object, `v18`, while ensuring `v12` has a specific type, `v17`. My initial examination reveals that `v12` is a viable candidate, as it is initially supported and can be stacked on `v18`.
           
           The standard approach to achieve this would involve:
           
           1.  **Pick:** Grasping `v12` from its initial pose (`v13`).
           2.  **Place:** Moving `v12` to a pose supported by `v18` (`#o2` is a candidate pose), effectively placing `v12` on `v18`.
           
           However, my analysis uncovers a crucial impediment related to the `canmove()` predicate.  The `pick` and `place` actions *require* `canmove()`, indicating the robot's ability to manipulate its arm (or *manipulator* as I refer to it). On the other hand, the `move_base` actions *negate* `canmove()`, which suggests that they are using the ability to move the robot *base*.  The provided `move_base` action instances are: `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` and others. But `move_base` also makes `canmove` false.
           
           Initially, `atbconf(v3)` (robot base configuration) is true. However, to execute the `pick` and `place` actions, which I identify require a base configuration `#o3` (according to the kinemantics facts), I would need to use `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`.  This poses the problem, however, that move base negates `canmove()`.
           Once `move_base` completes, `canmove()` becomes false. This means I cannot pick, because I can't do anything else.
           
           This creates a contradiction. To utilize either `pick` or `place`, I must also ensure `atbconf(#o3)`; to do that, I must utilize a `move_base` *and that's the problem*. A `move_base` action requires `canmove`, and when executed, removes `canmove()`. Because the `pick` and `place` operations require a current robot position, I can not do the pick or place operation.
           
           Therefore, under the given action definitions and initial state, I conclude that the goal is *unreachable*. I am unable to resolve this issue and believe the goal is *impossible* because the necessary `move_base` action violates the `canmove()` requirement for `pick` and `place`.
