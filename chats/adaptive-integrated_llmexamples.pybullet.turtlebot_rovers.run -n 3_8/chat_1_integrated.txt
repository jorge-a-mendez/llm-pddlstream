           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem requires achieving the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is a conjunction of several conditions. Let's break down these conditions:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This requires taking images of objectives v17, v18, and v19 with mode v11, and then sending these images to the lander v9.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means we need to analyze a rock of type `v2` and send the analysis. Rocks of type `v2` are `v1`, `v3`, and `v4`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means we need to analyze a rock of type `v6` and send the analysis. Rocks of type `v6` are `v5`, `v7`, and `v8`.
           
           We have two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, and a camera `v10` that supports mode `v11`. Both rovers have access to the store `v16`.
           
           Let's plan for the `receivedimage` predicates:
           For `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`:
           We need to calibrate the camera and take images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19` and then send them.
           Rover `v14` has `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates for these objectives and lander `v9` at configuration `#o3` and `#o0` respectively. Rover `v12` also has similar capabilities. We can use rover `v14` as it is at `v15` which has motion to `#o3` and `#o0`.
           
           Sequence for images:
           - Calibrate the camera `v10` using rover `v14` at configuration `#o3` to observe `v17` (or `v18` or `v19`).
           - Take image of `v17` using `v14` at `#o3`.
           - Take image of `v18` using `v14` at `#o3`.
           - Take image of `v19` using `v14` at `#o3`.
           - Move `v14` to configuration `#o0` to communicate.
           - Send images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19` to lander `v9`.
           
           Let's plan for `receivedanalysis` predicates:
           For `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`:
           We need to sample and analyze a rock of type `v2` and send its analysis. Rocks `v1`, `v3`, `v4` are of type `v2`.
           Both rovers `v12` and `v14` can be `above` `v1`, `v3`, `v4` at configuration `#o5`.
           
           For `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`:
           We need to sample and analyze a rock of type `v6` and send its analysis. Rocks `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are of type `v6`.
           Both rovers `v12` and `v14` can be `above` `v5`, `v7`, `v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           
           We can use rover `v12` to sample rocks. It is currently at `v13`. It has motion to `#o5` for sampling and `#o0` for sending analysis.
           
           Sequence for analysis:
           - Move `v12` to configuration `#o5`.
           - Sample a rock of type `v2`, e.g., `v3`.
           - Sample a rock of type `v6`, e.g., `v7`.
           - Move `v12` to configuration `#o0` to communicate.
           - Send analysis of `v3` to lander `v9`.
           - Send analysis of `v7` to lander `v9`.
           
           Combining these, we can optimize movements.
           Rover `v14` for image tasks:
           1. `move v14 v15 #o2 #o3` (move to imaging pose)
           2. `calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10`

           Rover `v12` for analysis tasks:

           2. `sample_rock v12 #o5 v3 v16` (type v2 stone)

           7. `send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v7`
           
           Let's assume the `calibrate` action is needed for each `take_image` unless the camera is already calibrated for that specific target. The problem description states `NegatedAtom calibrated(?c, ?v)` as an effect of `take_image`, so it makes sense to recalibrate.
           
           We need to provide specific continuous values for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` and `#o1`, `#o4` if they are used. Since `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for both rovers for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`, and `#o1` is a ray for `comvisible` and `#o4` for `imagevisible`, we must provide values for them.
           For the coordinates of the configuration, we need to choose them such that they are collision-free and within range.
           For `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `v17` is at `((1.887, 2.083), (1.984, 2.18))`. Rover `v14` is at `((-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571))`. A good pose for imaging would be around the target, within 2 units.
           For `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`, `v9` is at `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`. Rover `v14` at `((-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571))`.
           For `above(v12, #o5, v3)`, `v3` is at `((1.129, -0.221), (1.233, -0.117))`. Rover `v12` at `((0.821, -1.929), (1.187, -1.571))`. A good pose for sampling would be directly above the rock.
           
           Let's estimate some positions for the continuous parameters.
           Rover v14 (initial position (approx -1.0, -1.75))
           - `#o3` for imaging v17 (target (1.9, 2.1)): let's choose `(1.0, 1.0)` for v14 near the target, within range. This is within 2 units from the objects.
           - `#o0` for comms with v9 (target (-1.9, -2.0)): let's choose `(-1.5, -1.8)` for v14, which is close to its starting position and within 4 units from v9.
           
           Rover v12 (initial position (approx 1.0, -1.75))
           - `#o5` for sampling v3 (target (1.18, -0.17)): let's choose `(1.18, -0.05)` for v12, directly above v3.
           - `#o0` for comms with v9 (target (-1.9, -2.0)): let's choose `(-1.5, -1.8)` for v12, same as for v14 or maybe slightly different but within range from v9.
           
           We must ensure that the configurations used by one rover are collision-free with the other rover's bounding box and other objects. Since the given objects are relatively small and far apart, simple choices should work.
           
           Let's use distinct configurations for each rover even if they're close, as the problem requests a different continuous value for each (rover, target object) pair for `imagevisible` or `comvisible` that starts with '#'.
           For #o0:
           (v14, v9) and (v12, v9)
           For #o3:
           (v14, v17), (v14, v18), (v14, v19) and (v12, v17), (v12, v18), (v12, v19)
           For #o5:
           (v14, v1), (v14, v3), (v14, v4), (v14, v5), (v14, v7), (v14, v8)
           (v12, v1), (v12, v3), (v12, v4), (v12, v5), (v12, v7), (v12, v8)
           
           We are asked to give values for any #<name> that is involved in `conf(rover, #<name>)` AND is either the second argument to `imagevisible` or `comvisible`.
           So, we need to specify `#o0` (for v12, v14, for v9), `#o3` (for v12, v14, for v17, v18, v19), and `#o5` (for v12, v14, for various rocks). The rays `#o1` and `#o4` don't require coordinate specification, just existence.
           
           A single pose #o3 can be used for imaging multiple targets if the ray condition is met. Same for #o0 for comms with the lander. And #o5 for sampling multiple rocks.
           
           So, let's use:
           - `v14` at `v15` for starting.
           - `v14` moves to a config `#o3_v14_img` to image `v17, v18, v19`.
           - `v14` moves to a config `#o0_v14_com` to send images.
           - `v12` at `v13` for starting.
           - `v12` moves to a config `#o5_v12_samp` to sample `v3, v7`.
           - `v12` moves to a config `#o0_v12_com` to send analyses.
           
           Since the initial state already defines `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` for both rovers and connects them to rays and targets, we should just provide values for these given `#o<num>` and not create new ones with extra labels.
           
           Therefore, for rover `v14`:
           - `#o3` for imaging v17, v18, v19. Let's pick a pose that allows imaging all of them from a reasonable distance. For example, a point roughly in the middle of these objectives. `v17(1.9, 2.1)`, `v18(-0.6, 1.8)`, `v19(-2.1, 1.8)`. A point like `(0.0, 1.5)` could work for v14 to image these objectives.
           - `#o0` for `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`. Target `v9` is at `(-1.9, -2.0)`. Rover `v14` starts around `(-1.0, -1.75)`. Let's set `#o0` for v14 to `(-1.5, -1.8)`.
           
           For rover `v12`:
           - `#o5` for `above(v12, #o5, v3)` and `above(v12, #o5, v7)`. `v3` is at `(1.18, -0.17)`. `v7` is at `(1.5, -1.15)`. We can use two different `#o5` if needed or one if it works. Let's make `#o5` for `v12` a pose like `(1.18, -0.05)` for `v3`, and then move to a new `#o5` or reuse for `v7`. The problem only gives one `#o5` per rover. Let's choose `#o5` for `v12` to be `(1.3, -0.6)` which is above both and then `sample_rock` actions can be executed.
           - `#o0` for `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`. Target `v9` is at `(-1.9, -2.0)`. Rover `v12` starts around `(1.0, -1.75)`. Let's set `#o0` for v12 to `(-1.5, -1.8)`.
           
           The crucial part is that the continuous parameters are for (rover, target object) pairs, even if the same #<name> is used. Since #o0, #o3, #o5 are already tied to specific rovers and potential targets in the initial state as abstract objects, we should stick to using those and giving values.
           
           For ray #o1 (comms) and #o4 (imaging), we define them as a vector from the robot's configuration to the target.
           
           Plan structure:
           1. Rover `v14` moves to an imaging configuration (`#o3`).
           2. `v14` calibrates and takes images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           3. `v14` moves to a communication configuration (`#o0`).
           4. `v14` sends the images.
           5. Rover `v12` moves to a sampling configuration (`#o5`).
           6. `v12` samples rock `v3` (type v2).
           7. `v12` drops the rock to free space.
           8. `v12` samples rock `v7` (type v6).
           9. `v12` moves to a communication configuration (`#o0`).
           10. `v12` sends the analyses for `v3` and `v7`.
           
           This sequence fulfills all conditions of `new-axiom@0()`.
           
           ```
           The scene describes two rovers, v12 and v14, equipped with camera v10 that supports mode v11. There are several rock objectives (v1, v3, v4 of type v2; v5, v7, v8 of type v6) and image objectives (v17, v18, v19). A lander v9 is available for communication. The rovers are initially at v13 and v15 respectively, and both have free storage v16. The goal is to receive images of all image objectives and receive analysis of at least one rock of type v2 (stone) and one rock of type v6 (soil).
           
           The plan involves using rover v14 to capture and send images of the objectives v17, v18, and v19. Rover v12 will be used to sample and analyze rocks v3 (type v2) and v7 (type v6), and then send these analyses. The actions are ordered to minimize movement and satisfy preconditions. Calibration is performed before each image capture as `take_image` negates `calibrated`. The `drop_rock` action is used by v12 to make space for the second rock sample since the `store` v16 can only hold one sample at a time (indicated by `free` becoming `full` and `full` becoming `free`).

Model:     The previous plan had collision issues with the chosen configurations. Let's re-evaluate the configurations to avoid collisions.
           
           For `v14` imaging (`#o3`) targeting `v17, v18, v19`:
           - `v17`: (1.887, 2.083) to (1.984, 2.18)
           - `v18`: (-0.646, 1.759) to (-0.566, 1.839)
           - `v19`: (-2.125, 1.758) to (-2.028, 1.855)
           - Obstacle `v20`: (-0.05, -2.5) to (0.05, 2.5) - This is a thin vertical wall along the Y-axis near X=0.
           The previous `#o3` for `v14` at `(0.0, 1.5)` collided with `v20`. We need to move `v14` to a position where it has line of sight to these targets and avoids `v20`. Since `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`, moving it to `(0.5, 1.5)` might be good as it's to the right of `v20` and can see the targets. Or closer to the targets but still avoiding `v20`. Let's try `(0.1, 1.5)` which is just to the right of `v20`. This should allow line of sight to the targets.
           
           For `v14` and `v12` communicating (`#o0`) with `v9`:
           - `v9`: (-2.405, -2.346) to (-1.395, -1.654)
           The previous `#o0` at `(-1.5, -1.8)` collided with `v9` itself, which means the rover was inside the lander's bounding box. This is incorrect. We need to place `#o0` close to `v9` but outside its bounding box.
           `v9` is primarily in the third quadrant. Let's try placing `v14` at `(-1.0, -2.0)` for communication, which is close to its starting position `(-1.0, -1.75)` and near `v9` but outside of it.
           For `v12`, starting at `(1.0, -1.75)`, to communicate with `v9`, it will need to move further. Let's try `(-1.0, -2.0)` for `v12` as well, or `(-1.0, -2.5)` to be clear of v9. Given that `v14` starts closer, let's use `v14` for comms and `v12` for sampling only to minimize complex movements. Wait, the goal requires sending analysis from v12, so v12 must also be able to communicate. Let's try `(-1.0, -2.5)` for both `v14` and `v12` for `#o0`, as it's outside `v9`'s bounding box and within communication range (4 units).
           
           For `v12` sampling (`#o5`) targeting `v3` and `v7`:
           - `v3`: (1.129, -0.221) to (1.233, -0.117)
           - `v7`: (1.483, -1.213) to (1.61, -1.087)
           - Rover `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           The previous `#o5` for `v12` at `(1.3, -0.6)` should be fine. It's above both rocks. `v3` is roughly `(1.18, -0.17)`. `v7` is roughly `(1.5, -1.15)`. `(1.3, -0.6)` is roughly between them and should be collision-free. Let's check against `v20`: `(0.05, 2.5)` and `(-0.05, -2.5)`. `(1.3, -0.6)` is far from `v20`, so no collision.
           
           Let's refine the configuration values:
           - `#o3` for `v14` imaging (targets `v17, v18, v19`): A point `(0.1, 1.5)` is to the right of `v20` (which is at x=0) and should provide line of sight to all objectives (x values vary from -2.1 to 1.9, y from 1.7 to 2.1). Distance from `v14`'s start `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(0.1, 1.5)` is `sqrt((0.1 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.5 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(1.1^2 + 3.25^2) = sqrt(1.21 + 10.5625) = sqrt(11.7725) approx 3.43`. This is a bit far for `imagevisible` (max 2 units). We need something closer to the targets. Let's try splitting the imaging tasks between the rovers if needed or find a better single spot for v14.
           
           Re-evaluating `#o3` for `v14`: `v17` is at `(1.9, 2.1)`, `v18` at `(-0.6, 1.8)`, `v19` at `(-2.1, 1.8)`. The previous suggestion `(0.0, 1.5)` was bad due to `v20`.
           To reach `v17` (1.9, 2.1) within range 2, `v14` needs to be around `(1.0, 1.0)`.
           To reach `v18` (-0.6, 1.8) within range 2, `v14` needs to be around `(-0.6, 0.0)`.
           To reach `v19` (-2.1, 1.8) within range 2, `v14` needs to be around `(-2.1, 0.0)`.
           
           This suggests that a single `#o3` for `v14` to image all targets might be difficult due to range constraints. However, the problem statement provides only one `#o3` for `v14` and all three objectives. This implies there *is* a configuration `#o3` that allows imaging all three. Let's assume a general configuration around the targets.
           Perhaps the wording "imagevisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o)" means that for a given ?q (which is #o3), there is at least one ray ?y for each ?o. The configuration should be general enough to *see* all of them. Given the `v20` collision, let's pick a configuration to one side of `v20`. Since `v14` is on the left side of `v20` from a global perspective, `(-0.1, 1.5)` might be better. Distance from `v14`'s start `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-0.1, 1.5)` is `sqrt((-0.1 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.5 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.9^2 + 3.25^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 10.5625) = sqrt(11.3725) approx 3.37`. Still long for image range.
           
           Let's re-think `imagevisible` and `comvisible` ranges. `imagevisible` max range 2, `comvisible` max range 4.
           `v14` starting at `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           `v17` at `(1.9, 2.1)`. Distance approx `sqrt((1.9 - (-1.0))^2 + (2.1 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(2.9^2 + 3.85^2) = sqrt(8.41 + 14.8225) = sqrt(23.2325) approx 4.8`. This is too far for `v14` to image `v17` from its initial position or from any single pose to image all of them.
           
           This suggests that if the problem expects a single `#o3` to work for all, I must find a central point, and if it's too far for imagevisible, then it implies that I might need to make rover move to different positions for different images. But the provided action instances for `take_image` all use `v14 #o3 #o4` and `v12 #o3 #o4`. This implies that `#o3` is a single configuration for a given rover for all image objectives. This might suggest the target objects are closer than implied by their AABB centers or that the range limit is not as strict or the provided AABBs are misleading. Given the constraints, I will try to find a single pose for `#o3` that works.
           
           Let's try a different strategy for configurations.
           Rover `v14` `(-1.0, -1.75)` for imaging:
           - `#o3` for v14 to image v17, v18, v19. Let's try `(-0.5, 0.0)`.
             - Dist to v17 (1.9, 2.1): `sqrt((1.9 - (-0.5))^2 + (2.1 - 0.0)^2) = sqrt(2.4^2 + 2.1^2) = sqrt(5.76 + 4.41) = sqrt(10.17) approx 3.18`. Too far.
             - Dist to v18 (-0.6, 1.8): `sqrt((-0.6 - (-0.5))^2 + (1.8 - 0.0)^2) = sqrt(-0.1^2 + 1.8^2) = sqrt(0.01 + 3.24) = sqrt(3.25) approx 1.8`. OK.
             - Dist to v19 (-2.1, 1.8): `sqrt((-2.1 - (-0.5))^2 + (1.8 - 0.0)^2) = sqrt(-1.6^2 + 1.8^2) = sqrt(2.56 + 3.24) = sqrt(5.8) approx 2.4`. Too far.
           
           It seems imaging all three from one `#o3` is difficult for `v14` within 2 units.
           Let's try to achieve the `receivedimage` for `v18` and `v19` using `v14` and for `v17` using `v12`.
           But the goal only lists `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`. It doesn't specify which rover.
           
           If I must use one #o3 for a rover for ALL objectives, then `imagevisible` means that it's just generally possible from that position, not that it covers the range for all. The problem statement says "occlusion-free line-of-sight to the target object in the fourth argument... The maximum distance from the rover to the target is 2 for imagevisible". This is strict.
           
           This means a single `#o3` won't work for `v14` for all three image objectives given their positions. The given `imagevisible` predicates might be for a *specific* image target at `#o3`.
           E.g., `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` might be one pose, and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` might be a different pose, although they share the same `#o3` object. But the problem also says "If your plan uses some object #<name>... you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair". This supports the idea that the same `#o3` can have different underlying coordinates for different target pairs.
           
           So, let's redefine the continuous parameters specifically for the (rover, target) pair. This means I'll use the same `#o3` in the plan actions, but in the configurations section, I'll list multiple entries for `#o3` depending on the target.
           
           Revised Configurations:
           Rover `v14` imaging:
           - `#o3` for `v14` and `v17`: `v17` at `(1.9, 2.1)`. Let `v14` pose `#o3` at `(0.5, 2.0)`. Distance to `v17` is `sqrt((1.9-0.5)^2 + (2.1-2.0)^2) = sqrt(1.4^2 + 0.1^2) = sqrt(1.96 + 0.01) = sqrt(1.97) approx 1.4 < 2`. This avoids `v20`.
           - `#o3` for `v14` and `v18`: `v18` at `(-0.6, 1.8)`. Let `v14` pose `#o3` at `(-0.6, 0.5)`. Distance to `v18` is `sqrt((-0.6 - (-0.6))^2 + (1.8 - 0.5)^2) = sqrt(0^2 + 1.3^2) = 1.3 < 2`. This avoids `v20`.
           - `#o3` for `v14` and `v19`: `v19` at `(-2.1, 1.8)`. Let `v14` pose `#o3` at `(-1.0, 0.5)`. Distance to `v19` is `sqrt((-2.1 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.8 - 0.5)^2) = sqrt(-1.1^2 + 1.3^2) = sqrt(1.21 + 1.69) = sqrt(2.9) approx 1.7 < 2`. This avoids `v20`.
           So, `v14` will need to move to three different `#o3` configurations. This changes the plan significantly.
           
           Let's check the provided action instances carefully:
           `((calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10))`
           `((take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11))`
           This implies `#o3` is a specific pose for the (v14, v17) pair. If I call `(move v14 v15 #o2 #o3)`, then `#o3` must be *one* pose for *all* actions where `#o3` appears. This contradicts my interpretation of "different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair".
           
           Let's re-read the problem: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration such that, given the geometry of the scene, the configuration is collision-free for the rover, reachable from the rover's current configuration, and has occlusion-free line-of-sight to the target object in the fourth argument in the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate. ... If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name."
           
           This means that if my plan uses, say, `(take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)` and `(take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11)`, then the `#o3` used for `v17` and the `#o3` used for `v18` are the *same PDDL object* `#o3`, but map to *different continuous values* if needed to satisfy the conditions. This implies I need to use `move v14 curr_conf #o2 #o3` multiple times if the value of `#o3` changes between actions.
           
           So the plan should be:
           1. Move `v14` to a pose suitable for imaging `v17` (this is `conf_v14_v17_img` which is the value for `#o3` when used with `v17`).
           2. Calibrate and take image of `v17`.
           3. Move `v14` to a pose suitable for imaging `v18` (this is `conf_v14_v18_img` which is the value for `#o3` when used with `v18`).
           4. Calibrate and take image of `v18`.
           5. Move `v14` to a pose suitable for imaging `v19` (this is `conf_v14_v19_img` which is the value for `#o3` when used with `v19`).
           6. Calibrate and take image of `v19`.
           7. Move `v14` to a pose suitable for comms with `v9` (`conf_v14_v9_com` which is the value for `#o0` when used with `v9`).
           8. Send images.
           
           This makes the plan longer, but logically correct given the problem statement.
           
           Let's re-plan carefully.
           
           **Rover v14 (Imaging and Sending Images)**
           Initial `atconf(v14, v15)`.
           
           1.  **Image v17**:
               *   Target `v17` at `(1.9, 2.1)`. Let `#o3` for `(v14, v17)` be `(0.5, 2.0)`.
               *   Path: `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)` -> `(0.5, 2.0)`
               *   Actions: `(move v14 v15 #o2 #o3)` (using `(0.5, 2.0)` for `#o3` value)
                          `(calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)`
                          `(take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)`
           
           2.  **Image v18**:
               *   Target `v18` at `(-0.6, 1.8)`. Let `#o3` for `(v14, v18)` be `(-0.6, 0.5)`.
               *   Path: `(0.5, 2.0)` -> `(-0.6, 0.5)`
               *   Actions: `(move v14 #o3 #o2 #o3)` (using `(0.5, 2.0)` as first `#o3` and `(-0.6, 0.5)` as second `#o3`)
                          `(calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10)`
                          `(take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11)`
           
           3.  **Image v19**:
               *   Target `v19` at `(-2.1, 1.8)`. Let `#o3` for `(v14, v19)` be `(-1.0, 0.5)`.
               *   Path: `(-0.6, 0.5)` -> `(-1.0, 0.5)`
               *   Actions: `(move v14 #o3 #o2 #o3)` (using `(-0.6, 0.5)` as first `#o3` and `(-1.0, 0.5)` as second `#o3`)
                          `(calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v19 v10)`
                          `(take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v19 v10 v11)`
           
           4.  **Send Images**:
               *   Target `v9` at `(-1.9, -2.0)`. Let `#o0` for `(v14, v9)` be `(-1.0, -2.5)`.
               *   Path: `(-1.0, 0.5)` -> `(-1.0, -2.5)`
               *   Actions: `(move v14 #o3 #o2 #o0)` (using `(-1.0, 0.5)` as `#o3` and `(-1.0, -2.5)` as `#o0`)
                          `(send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11)`
                          `(send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11)`
                          `(send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v19 v11)`
           
           **Rover v12 (Sampling and Sending Analyses)**
           Initial `atconf(v12, v13)`.
           
           1.  **Sample v3 (type v2 stone)**:
               *   Target `v3` at `(1.18, -0.17)`. Let `#o5` for `(v12, v3)` be `(1.18, -0.05)`.
               *   Path: `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)` -> `(1.18, -0.05)`
               *   Actions: `(move v12 v13 #o2 #o5)` (using `(1.18, -0.05)` for `#o5`)
                          `(sample_rock v12 #o5 v3 v16)`
                          `(drop_rock v12 v16)`
           
           2.  **Sample v7 (type v6 soil)**:
               *   Target `v7` at `(1.5, -1.15)`. Let `#o5` for `(v12, v7)` be `(1.5, -1.0)`.
               *   Path: `(1.18, -0.05)` -> `(1.5, -1.0)`
               *   Actions: `(move v12 #o5 #o2 #o5)` (using `(1.18, -0.05)` as first `#o5` and `(1.5, -1.0)` as second `#o5`)
                          `(sample_rock v12 #o5 v7 v16)`
           
           3.  **Send Analyses**:
               *   Target `v9` at `(-1.9, -2.0)`. Let `#o0` for `(v12, v9)` be `(-1.0, -2.5)`.
               *   Path: `(1.5, -1.0)` -> `(-1.0, -2.5)`
               *   Actions: `(move v12 #o5 #o2 #o0)` (using `(1.5, -1.0)` as `#o5` and `(-1.0, -2.5)` as `#o0`)
                          `(send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v3)`
                          `(send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v7)`
           
           This makes the plan longer, but respects the interpretation of continuous values. All selected coordinates must avoid collisions with `v20`.
           `v20`: (-0.05, -2.5) to (0.05, 2.5)
           The chosen points are:
           - `(0.5, 2.0)`: x > 0.05, clear of `v20`.
           - `(-0.6, 0.5)`: x < -0.05, clear of `v20`.
           - `(-1.0, 0.5)`: x < -0.05, clear of `v20`.
           - `(-1.0, -2.5)`: x < -0.05, clear of `v20`.
           - `(1.18, -0.05)`: x > 0.05, clear of `v20`.
           - `(1.5, -1.0)`: x > 0.05, clear of `v20`.
           All chosen points for rover configurations are outside the `v20` collision box.
           The `#o0` pose `(-1.0, -2.5)` is outside of `v9`'s bounding box `(-2.405, -2.346)` to `(-1.395, -1.654)`. Specifically, the Y coordinate -2.5 is less than -2.346. So it should be clear.
           
           The explanation for the plan and configurations should reflect this detailed reasoning.
           
           ```
           The initial state describes two rovers, v12 and v14, equipped with camera v10 that supports mode v11. There are various rock objectives (v1, v3, v4 of type v2; v5, v7, v8 of type v6) and image objectives (v17, v18, v19). A lander v9 is available for communication. Both rovers are initially at valid configurations (v13 for v12, v15 for v14) and have free storage v16. The goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which requires receiving images of v17, v18, v19, and receiving analysis of at least one rock of type v2 (stone) and one rock of type v6 (soil).
           
           The continuous parameters (configurations like #o0, #o3, #o5) can represent different physical locations for the same abstract PDDL object depending on the specific (rover, target object) pair involved in predicates like `imagevisible` or `comvisible`. Therefore, the plan will explicitly move the rover to a specific configuration before executing an action that requires a particular line-of-sight or proximity to a target, even if the PDDL object representing the configuration (`#o3`, `#o0`, `#o5`) remains the same. This ensures that the continuous values provided for each specific (rover, target) pair satisfy reachability, collision-free, and line-of-sight requirements.
           
           Rover v14 will handle all image capturing and sending. It will move to three different locations, each optimized for imaging one of the objectives (v17, v18, v19) to meet the `imagevisible` range requirement of 2 units, while avoiding collision with obstacle v20 (a thin wall at x=0). After capturing all images, v14 will move to a communication-suitable location to transmit them to lander v9, ensuring it's outside the lander's bounding box.
           
           Rover v12 will handle rock sampling and sending analysis. It will move to two different locations, each optimized to be `above` the target rocks (v3 of type v2, and v7 of type v6), avoiding collisions. After sampling v3, it will drop the rock to free up its storage v16 before sampling v7. Finally, v12 will move to a communication-suitable location (outside v9's bounding box) to transmit the analyses.

           - `v21`: `((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))` - obstacle in the first quadrant.
           - `v22`: `((-2.55, -2.55), (2.55, -2.45))` - thin horizontal wall at y=-2.5.

           Target Objectives:
           - `v17`: `(1.9, 2.1)` (approx)
           - `v18`: `(-0.6, 1.8)` (approx)
           - `v19`: `(-2.1, 1.8)` (approx)
           - `v3` (type v2): `(1.18, -0.17)` (approx)
           - `v7` (type v6): `(1.5, -1.15)` (approx)
           
           Maximum distances: `imagevisible` (2 units), `comvisible` (4 units).
           
           Let's carefully choose new collision-free and reachable configurations for each (rover, target) pair.
           
           **Rover v14 (Imaging and Sending Images)**
           
           1.  **Image v17**: `v17` at `(1.9, 2.1)`. Obstacle `v21` is `((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))`.
               The previous choice `(0.5, 2.0)` collided with `v21`. We need to be outside of `v21`. Let's try `(1.0, 2.0)`.
               -   `v14` from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(1.0, 2.0)`. Distance `sqrt((1.0 - (-1.0))^2 + (2.0 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(2.0^2 + 3.75^2) = sqrt(4 + 14.0625) = sqrt(18.0625) approx 4.25`. This might be too far to reach quickly.
               -   Let's try to put v14 closer to `v17` and avoiding `v21`. A point like `(1.7, 1.5)` is clear of `v21` and closer to `v17`.
                   -   Distance from `(1.7, 1.5)` to `v17` `(1.9, 2.1)`: `sqrt((1.9-1.7)^2 + (2.1-1.5)^2) = sqrt(0.2^2 + 0.6^2) = sqrt(0.04 + 0.36) = sqrt(0.4) approx 0.63 < 2`. OK.
                   -   Check against `v20`: `(1.7, 1.5)` is outside `x=0` wall.
                   -   Check against `v21`: `(1.7, 1.5)` is outside `((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))`. OK.
                   -   Reachability from `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(1.7, 1.5)`: `sqrt((1.7 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.5 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(2.7^2 + 3.25^2) = sqrt(7.29 + 10.5625) = sqrt(17.8525) approx 4.22`. This might still be deemed "not reachable" if a strict short distance is implied.
           
               Let's retry: `v14` needs to image `v17, v18, v19`. `v18` and `v19` are in the second/third quadrant, `v17` is in the first. It's difficult for one rover to handle all. Let's assign `v14` to image `v18` and `v19` (closer to its side of `v20`) and `v12` to image `v17` (closer to its side of `v20`). This makes sense for reachability.
           
               **Revised plan for image objectives**
               - `v14` images `v18` and `v19`.
               - `v12` images `v17`.
           
               **Rover v14 (Imaging v18, v19)**
               Initial `atconf(v14, v15)` `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           
               1.  **Image v18**: `v18` at `(-0.6, 1.8)`.
                   -   Let `#o3` for `(v14, v18)` be `(-0.6, 0.5)`. (Recheck collision with `v20`: x = -0.6 is fine. Reachability: `sqrt((-0.6 - (-1.0))^2 + (0.5 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.4^2 + 2.25^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 5.0625) = sqrt(5.2225) approx 2.28`. This might be considered reachable, as it's not a huge jump). Let's go with this.
                   -   Actions: `(move v14 v15 #o2 #o3)` (with value `(-0.6, 0.5)` for `#o3`)
                              `(calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10)`
                              `(take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11)`
           
               2.  **Image v19**: `v19` at `(-2.1, 1.8)`.
                   -   Let `#o3` for `(v14, v19)` be `(-1.0, 0.5)`. (Recheck collision with `v20`: x = -1.0 is fine. Reachability: from `(-0.6, 0.5)` to `(-1.0, 0.5)`: `sqrt((-1.0 - (-0.6))^2 + (0.5 - 0.5)^2) = sqrt(-0.4^2 + 0^2) = 0.4`. Very reachable).
                   -   Actions: `(move v14 #o3 #o2 #o3)` (first `#o3` `(-0.6, 0.5)`, second `#o3` `(-1.0, 0.5)`)

                              `(take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v19 v10 v11)`
           
               **Rover v14 (Sending Images for v18, v19)**
               -   Target `v9` at `(-1.9, -2.0)`. Obstacle `v22` at `y = -2.5`.
               -   The previous choice `(-1.0, -2.5)` collided with `v22`. We need to be above `v22` and near `v9`.
               -   Let `#o0` for `(v14, v9)` be `(-1.0, -2.0)`. This is near `v9` and above `v22`.
                   -   Distance to `v9` `(-1.9, -2.0)`: `sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.0))^2 + (-2.0 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt(-0.9^2 + 0^2) = 0.9 < 4`. OK.
                   -   Reachability from `(-1.0, 0.5)` to `(-1.0, -2.0)`: `sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.0))^2 + (-2.0 - 0.5)^2) = sqrt(0^2 + (-2.5)^2) = 2.5`. Reachable.
               -   Actions: `(move v14 #o3 #o2 #o0)` (first `#o3` `(-1.0, 0.5)`, `#o0` `(-1.0, -2.0)`)

                          `(send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v19 v11)`
           
           **Rover v12 (Imaging v17, Sampling, and Sending Analyses)**
           Initial `atconf(v12, v13)` `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           1.  **Image v17**: `v17` at `(1.9, 2.1)`. Obstacle `v21` is `((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))`.
               -   Let `#o3` for `(v12, v17)` be `(1.7, 1.5)`. This is clear of `v20` and `v21`.
                   -   Distance from `(1.7, 1.5)` to `v17` `(1.9, 2.1)`: `0.63 < 2`. OK.
                   -   Reachability from `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(1.7, 1.5)`: `sqrt((1.7-1.0)^2 + (1.5-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.7^2 + 3.25^2) = sqrt(0.49 + 10.5625) = sqrt(11.0525) approx 3.32`. This should be reachable.
               -   Actions: `(move v12 v13 #o2 #o3)` (with value `(1.7, 1.5)` for `#o3`)
                          `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)`

           2.  **Sample v3 (type v2 stone)**: `v3` at `(1.18, -0.17)`.
               -   Previous `#o5` at `(1.18, -0.05)` was "not reachable". This often happens if the path is blocked or if the movement required is too large compared to typical robot step. Let's try something closer to its current location `(1.7, 1.5)` or its initial location `(1.0, -1.75)`.
               -   Let `#o5` for `(v12, v3)` be `(1.18, -0.05)`. This is close to `v3`.
                   -   Reachability from `(1.7, 1.5)` to `(1.18, -0.05)`: `sqrt((1.18 - 1.7)^2 + (-0.05 - 1.5)^2) = sqrt(-0.52^2 + -1.55^2) = sqrt(0.2704 + 2.4025) = sqrt(2.6729) approx 1.63`. This should be reachable.

                          `(drop_rock v12 v16)`
           
           3.  **Sample v7 (type v6 soil)**: `v7` at `(1.5, -1.15)`.
               -   Let `#o5` for `(v12, v7)` be `(1.5, -1.0)`.

               -   Let `#o0` for `(v12, v9)` be `(-1.0, -2.0)`. This is above `v22` and near `v9`.
                   -   Distance to `v9` `(-1.9, -2.0)`: `0.9 < 4`. OK.

           This revised plan distributes imaging tasks between the two rovers to improve reachability and avoid collisions, and carefully selects coordinates for each continuous parameter instance.
           
           ```
           The initial state describes two rovers, v12 and v14, equipped with camera v10 that supports mode v11. There are various rock objectives (v1, v3, v4 of type v2; v5, v7, v8 of type v6) and image objectives (v17, v18, v19). A lander v9 is available for communication. Both rovers are initially at valid configurations (v13 for v12, v15 for v14) and have free storage v16. The goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which requires receiving images of v17, v18, v19, and receiving analysis of at least one rock of type v2 (stone) and one rock of type v6 (soil).
           
           To address previous collision and reachability issues, the plan distributes imaging tasks between the two rovers. Rover v14 will image objectives v18 and v19, which are closer to its starting side of obstacle v20 (a vertical wall at x=0). Rover v12 will image objective v17, which is closer to its starting side of obstacle v20. Both rovers will ensure their communication configurations for lander v9 are clear of obstacle v22 (a horizontal wall at y=-2.5) and outside v9's bounding box. Sampling configurations are chosen to be directly above the target rocks and reachable. The calibration action is performed before each image capture. The `drop_rock` action is used by v12 to free its storage after the first sample to allow for the second sample.

Model:     The challenges persist with reachability and occlusion. It seems the default reachability or visibility calculations are more stringent than initially assumed, or the scene geometry is trickier. "Not reachable for robot base" often means the path is too long or there are implicit obstacles. "Not valid because target is not visible due to occlusion" means line of sight is blocked.
           
           Let's re-examine the task and simplify. If most configurations are not reachable or occluded, we need to drastically change the approach.
           The problem statement implies that valid action instances are provided and *any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used*. This is the critical constraint. However, the problem also says that continuous parameters (`#o<name>`) are *not yet computed* and *we must provide values*. This is contradictory to the previous statement, as it asks me to provide continuous values for instances that are "allowed to be used". This implies the *structure* of the action instance is allowed, but the specific values for the `#o<name>` variables need to be found.
           
           Given the continuous parameter constraints, it means the `move` actions which involve `#o<name>` are technically allowed, but I must provide valid coordinate values. The error messages highlight that my chosen coordinates are often not reachable or are occluded. This suggests that the robot's movement capabilities are limited or there are more hidden obstacles.
           
           Let's try to use the *pre-defined configurations* `v13` and `v15` as much as possible, as these are *known* to be valid base configurations.
           Rover `v14` is at `v15`. Rover `v12` is at `v13`.
           
           Let's list what's possible from `v15` for `v14` and `v13` for `v12` without any moves to `#o<name>` configurations.
           
           Check initial state predicates for `v14` at `v15` and `v12` at `v13`:
           - No `imagevisible` or `comvisible` directly from `v15` or `v13` in the initial state. All are tied to `#o0`, `#o3`.
           - All `above` predicates for sampling are tied to `#o5`.
           
           This means some movement to a `#o<name>` configuration is always necessary. The issue is in finding suitable `x, y` for these `#o<name>` configurations. The errors "not reachable for robot base" suggest either the straight line distance is too far for the robot's locomotion model or there are unmodeled obstacles that make the path difficult.
           
           Let's try to move rovers to simple, less aggressive configurations.
           For `imagevisible` (range 2), we need to be quite close. For `comvisible` (range 4), there's more leeway.
           
           Let's try to focus on `v14` for imaging, and `v12` for sampling.
           
           **Rover v14 for imaging:**
           `v14` starts at `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           Targets: `v17 (1.9, 2.1)`, `v18 (-0.6, 1.8)`, `v19 (-2.1, 1.8)`.
           
           -   **Image v18**: `(-0.6, 1.8)`. Let `#o3` for `(v14, v18)` be `(-0.7, 1.0)`.
               -   Distance to `v18`: `sqrt((-0.6 - (-0.7))^2 + (1.8 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.1^2 + 0.8^2) = sqrt(0.01 + 0.64) = sqrt(0.65) approx 0.8 < 2`. OK.
               -   Reachability from `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-0.7, 1.0)`: `sqrt((-0.7 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.0 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.3^2 + 2.75^2) = sqrt(0.09 + 7.5625) = sqrt(7.6525) approx 2.76`. This is still a bit long, but let's try.
               -   Collision: `v20 (x=0)` is avoided. `v21` is `((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))` is avoided.
           
           -   **Image v19**: `(-2.1, 1.8)`. Let `#o3` for `(v14, v19)` be `(-1.5, 1.0)`.
               -   Distance to `v19`: `sqrt((-2.1 - (-1.5))^2 + (1.8 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt(-0.6^2 + 0.8^2) = sqrt(0.36 + 0.64) = sqrt(1.0) = 1 < 2`. OK.
               -   Reachability from `(-0.7, 1.0)` to `(-1.5, 1.0)`: `sqrt((-1.5 - (-0.7))^2 + (1.0 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt(-0.8^2 + 0^2) = 0.8`. Short, likely reachable.
           
           -   **Image v17**: `(1.9, 2.1)`. This is far from `v14`'s side of `v20`. Let's use `v12` for `v17`.
           
           **Rover v12 for imaging and sampling:**
           `v12` starts at `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           -   **Image v17**: `(1.9, 2.1)`. Let `#o3` for `(v12, v17)` be `(1.8, 1.0)`.
               -   Distance to `v17`: `sqrt((1.9 - 1.8)^2 + (2.1 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.1^2 + 1.1^2) = sqrt(0.01 + 1.21) = sqrt(1.22) approx 1.1 < 2`. OK.
               -   Reachability from `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(1.8, 1.0)`: `sqrt((1.8 - 1.0)^2 + (1.0 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.8^2 + 2.75^2) = sqrt(0.64 + 7.5625) = sqrt(8.2025) approx 2.86`. This is still a bit long, but let's try it.
               -   Collision: `(1.8, 1.0)` is clear of `v20` and `v21`.
           
           -   **Sample v3**: `(1.18, -0.17)`. Let `#o5` for `(v12, v3)` be `(1.18, -0.05)`. This was previously `not reachable`. The distance from `(1.8, 1.0)` to `(1.18, -0.05)` is `sqrt((1.18 - 1.8)^2 + (-0.05 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt(-0.62^2 + -1.05^2) = sqrt(0.3844 + 1.1025) = sqrt(1.4869) approx 1.22`. This is a relatively short move. The "not reachable" might refer to specific pathfinding issues rather than just distance. Let's try it again.
           
           -   **Sample v7**: `(1.5, -1.15)`. Let `#o5` for `(v12, v7)` be `(1.5, -1.0)`. The distance from `(1.18, -0.05)` to `(1.5, -1.0)` is `approx 1.0`.
           
           **Communication for both rovers:**
           Lander `v9`: `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
           Obstacle `v22`: `((-2.55, -2.55), (2.55, -2.45))`.
           The previous `(-1.0, -2.0)` for `#o0` was `occluded`. This means there's something blocking line of sight from `(-1.0, -2.0)` to `v9` `(-1.9, -2.0)`. This could be `v20` or `v22` itself if the ray passes through it.
           Let's choose `(-1.5, -1.5)` for `#o0`. This is above `v9` in Y, and inside the range.
           -   `(-1.5, -1.5)` is clear of `v22` (y > -2.45).
           -   `(-1.5, -1.5)` is clear of `v20` (x != 0).
           -   Distance from `(-1.5, -1.5)` to `v9` `(-1.9, -2.0)`: `sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.5))^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.5))^2) = sqrt(-0.4^2 + -0.5^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 0.25) = sqrt(0.41) approx 0.64 < 4`. OK.
           
           Reachability for `(-1.5, -1.5)`:
           -   From `v14`'s last position `(-1.5, 1.0)`: `sqrt((-1.5 - (-1.5))^2 + (-1.5 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt(0^2 + -2.5^2) = 2.5`. Reachable.
           -   From `v12`'s last position `(1.5, -1.0)`: `sqrt((-1.5 - 1.5)^2 + (-1.5 - (-1.0))^2) = sqrt(-3.0^2 + -0.5^2) = sqrt(9 + 0.25) = sqrt(9.25) approx 3.04`. Reachable.
           
           Let's hope these configurations work.
           
           ```
           The scene involves two rovers, v12 and v14, camera v10, mode v11, various rock and image objectives, and lander v9. The goal is to obtain images of v17, v18, v19, and analyses of a type v2 rock and a type v6 rock. Previous attempts faced issues with configurations being unreachable or occluded due to obstacles v20 (vertical wall at x=0), v21 (box in first quadrant), v22 (horizontal wall at y=-2.5), and the lander v9 itself.
           
           To address these, the plan is modified to:
           1.  Distribute image capture tasks: Rover v14 will image v18 and v19, which are on its side of the v20 obstacle. Rover v12 will image v17, which is on its side.
           2.  Carefully select configuration coordinates: New coordinates are chosen to ensure they are collision-free with all known obstacles, within the range limits for `imagevisible` (2 units) and `comvisible` (4 units), and a reasonable distance from the robot's previous position to be "reachable".
           3.  Communication: Both rovers will use a common communication pose (#o0) that is clear of obstacle v22 and outside the lander v9's bounding box, while providing a clear line of sight.

Model:     The repeated "not reachable" and collision errors are proving challenging. The "not reachable" error seems to suggest that moving the robot a distance of 2-3 units, even in open space, might be considered too far or complex for the robot's base. The collision with `v9` for communication means even `(-1.5, -1.5)` is too close or overlapping.
           
           Let's assume "not reachable" implies the robot can only move very short distances from its initial configuration, or that paths are extremely restricted. If this is the case, perhaps there are no valid `move` actions that change the base configuration to an `#o<name>` configuration.
           
           However, the problem implies that I *must* use `#o<name>` configurations for `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` predicates. If no such configurations are "reachable" for any of the targets, then the task might be impossible given the current understanding of "reachable".
           
           Let's assume the "not reachable" is related to the magnitude of the displacement in one `move` action. If the robot can only move in small steps, then a chain of `move` actions would be needed, but the provided `motion` predicates are between one `#o<name>` and another, or between `#o<name>` and `v13/v15`. There's no fine-grained motion control with small steps.
           
           This leaves me with a difficult choice:
           1.  Assume the "not reachable" errors are due to incorrect coordinate choices, and I need to find even closer points or different routes.
           2.  Conclude that, under the current interpretation of "reachable", the goal is not achievable.
           
           Given that I must provide a plan if achievable, I will try to find *very minimal* moves, or locations extremely close to the targets or current positions, even if it feels counterintuitive for imaging. The `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates require *line of sight* and *range*, not necessarily a large movement to get the best angle.
           
           Let's try to make the `#o<name>` configurations as close to the initial `v15` or `v13` as possible, or directly next to the target.
           
           **Re-evaluating Configurations:**
           
           **Rover v14 (initial `v15` at `(-1.0, -1.75)` approx)**
           
           *   **Image v18**: `v18` at `(-0.6, 1.8)`. Previous `(-0.7, 1.0)` was not reachable. This is really concerning for reachability. Let's try to put `v14` very close to `v18`. Maybe at `(-0.6, 1.7)`.
               *   Distance to `v18`: `sqrt((-0.6 - (-0.6))^2 + (1.8 - 1.7)^2) = sqrt(0^2 + 0.1^2) = 0.1 < 2`. OK.
               *   Reachability from `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-0.6, 1.7)`: `sqrt((-0.6 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.7 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.4^2 + 3.45^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 11.9025) = sqrt(12.0625) approx 3.47`. This seems too far if ~2.8 was "not reachable".
           
           What if "not reachable" means *from the initial location of the rover*, for any `#o<name>` that is not directly `v13` or `v15`? This is highly restrictive.
           Let's consider the `motion` predicates in the initial state. They include motions between `v13` and `#o<name>`, `v15` and `#o<name>`, and between different `#o<name>`s.
           For example, `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o3)` is given. This means a move from `v15` to `#o3` is *possible*. The issue is what *value* `#o3` can take.
           
           The continuous values must be *collision-free, reachable, and occlusion-free*.
           Let's reconsider the "reachable" part. Maybe it implies that the robot cannot cross the `v20` wall at x=0 for example.
           `v14` starts at x=-1.0. `v12` starts at x=1.0.
           `v18` (-0.6, 1.8) and `v19` (-2.1, 1.8) are on `v14`'s side of `v20`.
           `v17` (1.9, 2.1) is on `v12`'s side of `v20`.
           
           Let's try to keep moves *extremely local* to the rover's initial area.
           
           **Rover v14 (initial `v15` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`)**
           *   **Image v18**: `(-0.6, 1.8)`. `v14` is around `(-1.0, -1.75)`. This objective is quite far in the Y direction. If the Y movement is the issue, perhaps the robot can't just drive across a large empty space.
               *   Let's try to put `#o3` for `(v14, v18)` very close to `v15`, for example `(-1.0, -1.5)`. This is just 0.25 units away. But this will definitely not be in range for `v18` which is at `(-0.6, 1.8)`. Distance `sqrt((-0.6 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.8 - (-1.5))^2) = sqrt(0.4^2 + 3.3^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 10.89) = sqrt(11.05) approx 3.3`. Too far.
           
           It seems the `imagevisible` range of 2 units is the main bottleneck for long-distance imaging. If rovers can't reach closer than 2 units, they can't take images.
           
           Let's try to solve a smaller part of the goal first to see if any move is successful.
           Focus on `receivedanalysis(?r)` first, as `above` may have weaker range constraints.
           
           **Rover v12 (initial `v13` at `(1.0, -1.75)`)**
           *   **Sample v3**: `(1.18, -0.17)`. Previous `(1.18, -0.05)` was "not reachable".
               *   Let `#o5` for `(v12, v3)` be `(1.0, -0.2)`. This is very close to `v3` and close to `v12`'s initial X coordinate.
               *   Reachability from `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(1.0, -0.2)`: `sqrt((1.0 - 1.0)^2 + (-0.2 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0^2 + 1.55^2) = 1.55`. This is a short vertical move. This *must* be reachable.
               *   `above(v12, (1.0, -0.2), v3)`? `v3` is `(1.129, -0.221) to (1.233, -0.117)`. So `(1.0, -0.2)` is adjacent, not above. We need to be centered over the object. So `(1.18, -0.17)` is ideal. But this was "not reachable". This implies `v12` cannot move to `(1.18, -0.17)` from `(1.0, -1.75)`. Distance `sqrt((1.18-1.0)^2 + (-0.17 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.18^2 + 1.58^2) = sqrt(0.0324 + 2.4964) = sqrt(2.5288) approx 1.59`. This is a short move. This "not reachable" error is very perplexing for such a short movement.
           
           Given these strict "not reachable" errors, even for small distances, it's possible that the "robot base" refers to a very constrained movement model, or there are unseen barriers.
           
           What if the initial configurations `v13` and `v15` are the *only* configurations the robot base can ever be at, and `#o<name>` means a configuration of an *arm* or *tool* which is always relative to the base? The problem states `conf(?v: object, ?q: object)` where `?v` is a rover and `?q` is a configuration. This implies `?q` is a configuration of the rover *base*.
           
           If these small moves are consistently "not reachable", there may be something fundamental blocking the plan. Could it be that `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)` etc. are present, but the actual `#o2` (a continuous trajectory) itself is the issue if no valid trajectory can be found? This is usually handled by the underlying motion planner. My job is to provide valid end poses.
           
           Let's assume the provided AABBs are sufficient and I just need to find the correct coordinates.
           The "not reachable" errors on small distances are the biggest problem.
           Perhaps I should try to move the robot *less* in the Y dimension.
           
           Let's try to focus on `v12` first since it has rocks that need sampling.
           `v12` at `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           Rocks `v3` `(1.18, -0.17)`, `v7` `(1.5, -1.15)`.
           The closest point to `v3` that is `above` it would be `(1.18, -0.17 + epsilon)` or `(1.18, -0.1)` approximately.
           Let's make `#o5` for `(v12, v3)` be `(1.18, -0.1)`.
           Reachability from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(1.18, -0.1)`: `sqrt((1.18-1.0)^2 + (-0.1 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.18^2 + 1.65^2) = sqrt(0.0324 + 2.7225) = sqrt(2.7549) approx 1.66`.
           
           This is still a distance of ~1.66 units. If this is consistently failing reachability, then the problem is more severe.
           
           What if the reachability is relative to the *theta* of the robot? `v13` is `(1.0, -1.75, 3.142)`. This means it's facing towards negative X.
           
           Let's try using `v12` to handle everything if possible, as it's closer to the origin.
           
           Consider the layout of the objects:
           `v17` `(1.9, 2.1)` - top right
           `v18` `(-0.6, 1.8)` - top left
           `v19` `(-2.1, 1.8)` - far top left
           `v3` `(1.18, -0.17)` - mid right
           `v7` `(1.5, -1.15)` - mid right
           
           Rover `v12` at `(1.0, -1.75)` seems more centrally located for the rocks and `v17`.
           Rover `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)` seems better for `v18`, `v19`.
           
           Let's retry the distributed plan, focusing on very minimal changes from initial positions and careful coordinate selection.
           
           **Rover v14 (initial `v15` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`)**
           
           *   **Image v18**: `(-0.6, 1.8)`. Try `#o3` for `(v14, v18)` at `(-0.6, 1.0)`. (Slight Y-shift from prev `(-0.6, 0.5)`).
               *   Distance to `v18`: `sqrt(0^2 + (1.8-1.0)^2) = 0.8 < 2`. OK.
               *   Reachability from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-0.6, 1.0)`: `sqrt(0.4^2 + 2.75^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 7.5625) = sqrt(7.7225) approx 2.78`. This distance is the core of the "not reachable" problem.
           
           Let's be extremely minimal. What if `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o3)` only means `v15` is "close enough" to `#o3`?
           If moves > 1-2 units are generally "not reachable", then the plan is highly restricted.
           
           Let's assume the continuous values given in the initial state like `v15 (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)` are accurate. And the given AABBs for rocks, objectives and obstacles are accurate.
           
           **Crucial insight:** `comvisible` requires a ray and target, `imagevisible` requires a ray and target, `above` means above the target. For these conditions to be met at a *reachable* configuration, the robot must be *able to move* there. The problem specifies `motion(?v, ?q1, ?t, ?q2)` predicates as a precondition for `move`. So if `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o3)` exists, then a transition to some valid `#o3` from `v15` *should* be possible. The "not reachable" implies the coordinate I chose for `#o3` doesn't work with the `v15 -> #o3` motion.
           
           This leads me to believe the problem setter has a very specific idea of reachable poses. Let's try configurations that are only slightly perturbed from the initial `v13` or `v15`.
           
           **Rover v14 (initial `v15` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`)**
           *   **Image v18**: `(-0.6, 1.8)`. Let's try to keep `v14` very close to its starting point. `#o3` for `(v14, v18)` at `(-1.0, -1.0)`.
               *   Distance from `v15` to `(-1.0, -1.0)` is `0.75`. Very reachable.
               *   Distance from `(-1.0, -1.0)` to `v18 (-0.6, 1.8)`: `sqrt((-0.6 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.8 - (-1.0))^2) = sqrt(0.4^2 + 2.8^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 7.84) = sqrt(8) approx 2.8`. Too far for image.
           
           The image distance of 2 units is the core constraint.
           If a configuration that is *reachable* is too far to see anything, then this path is fundamentally flawed.
           
           Perhaps the only valid moves are those that don't involve a large change in position, and some `#o<name>` configurations are pre-computed near the targets. But I have to provide the values.
           
           Let's assume that "not reachable" implies the distance is too great. This suggests the available moves are *extremely small*.
           If a robot can only move ~1 unit, then it cannot reach objectives that are 2-3 units away.
           This would make the goal unachievable.
           
           However, I must provide a plan. So there must be a way.
           Let's consider that the `imagerange` and `comrange` predicates in the initial state, e.g., `imagerange(v14, #o3, v17)`, imply there *is* a valid `#o3` for `v14` and `v17` that works for range. This means my coordinate choices are the issue.
           
           Let's assume the robot cannot cross the x=0 axis if it starts on one side, for the 'reachable' part.
           `v14` starts at x=-1.0. `v12` starts at x=1.0.
           So `v14` should deal with `v18` and `v19`. `v12` should deal with `v17`.
           
           **Redo all coordinates using minimal distances from start, staying on respective sides of x=0 where applicable, and avoiding obstacles.**
           
           **Rover v14 (initial `v15` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`)**
           
           *   **Image v18**: `(-0.6, 1.8)`. Let `#o3` for `(v14, v18)` be `(-0.6, 0.0)`.
               *   Distance to `v18`: `sqrt(0^2 + (1.8 - 0.0)^2) = 1.8 < 2`. OK.
               *   Reachability from `(-1.0, -1.75)`: `sqrt((-0.6 - (-1.0))^2 + (0.0 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.4^2 + 1.75^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 3.0625) = sqrt(3.2225) approx 1.79`. This is a shorter move than before. Let's try it.
           
           *   **Image v19**: `(-2.1, 1.8)`. Let `#o3` for `(v14, v19)` be `(-1.5, 0.0)`.
               *   Distance to `v19`: `sqrt((-2.1 - (-1.5))^2 + (1.8 - 0.0)^2) = sqrt(-0.6^2 + 1.8^2) = sqrt(0.36 + 3.24) = sqrt(3.6) approx 1.89 < 2`. OK.
               *   Reachability from `(-0.6, 0.0)`: `sqrt((-1.5 - (-0.6))^2 + (0.0 - 0.0)^2) = 0.9`. Shorter.
           
           *   **Comms for v14**: `v9` at `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`. Obstacle `v22` at `y=-2.5`.
               *   Let `#o0` for `(v14, v9)` be `(-1.5, -2.0)`. (This is very close to `v9` and above `v22`'s lower bound.)
               *   Distance to `v9`: `sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.5))^2 + (-2.0 - (-2.0))^2) = 0.4 < 4`. OK.
               *   Reachability from `(-1.5, 0.0)`: `sqrt((-1.5 - (-1.5))^2 + (-2.0 - 0.0)^2) = 2.0`. Shorter.
           
           **Rover v12 (initial `v13` at `(1.0, -1.75)`)**
           
           *   **Image v17**: `(1.9, 2.1)`. Let `#o3` for `(v12, v17)` be `(1.5, 1.0)`.
               *   Distance to `v17`: `sqrt((1.9 - 1.5)^2 + (2.1 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.4^2 + 1.1^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 1.21) = sqrt(1.37) approx 1.17 < 2`. OK.
               *   Reachability from `(1.0, -1.75)`: `sqrt((1.5 - 1.0)^2 + (1.0 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.5^2 + 2.75^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 7.5625) = sqrt(7.8125) approx 2.79`. Still a long move. This is the one that's consistently rejected.
               *   Let's check `v21`: `((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))`. `(1.5, 1.0)` is clear.
           
           *   **Sample v3**: `(1.18, -0.17)`. Let `#o5` for `(v12, v3)` be `(1.18, -0.1)`. (Slight Y-shift from prev).
               *   Reachability from `(1.5, 1.0)`: `sqrt((1.18 - 1.5)^2 + (-0.1 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt(-0.32^2 + -1.1^2) = sqrt(0.1024 + 1.21) = sqrt(1.3124) approx 1.14`. This is a short move.
           
           *   **Sample v7**: `(1.5, -1.15)`. Let `#o5` for `(v12, v7)` be `(1.5, -1.0)`.
               *   Reachability from `(1.18, -0.1)`: `sqrt((1.5 - 1.18)^2 + (-1.0 - (-0.1))^2) = sqrt(0.32^2 + -0.9^2) = sqrt(0.1024 + 0.81) = sqrt(0.9124) approx 0.95`. Short move.
           
           *   **Comms for v12**: `v9` at `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
               *   Let `#o0` for `(v12, v9)` be `(-1.5, -2.0)`.
               *   Reachability from `(1.5, -1.0)`: `sqrt((-1.5 - 1.5)^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.0))^2) = sqrt(-3.0^2 + -1.0^2) = sqrt(9 + 1) = sqrt(10) approx 3.16`. This is a longer move. This one is also a potential source of "not reachable".
           
           It's clear that the "not reachable" constraint is very hard. If even 1.6-2.0 distance is not reachable, then the robot can barely move.
           
           What if the initial `v13` and `v15` are the *only* reachable positions for the robot bases? If that's the case, then no `move` actions that change the robot's configuration will be valid. But the problem defines `motion` predicates.
           
           Given the continuous rejections, it's highly likely that the robot base cannot move far from its starting position, or there are unstated geometry constraints that are making these configurations unreachable or occluded. If this is the case, the problem as stated (requiring dynamic configuration generation) becomes practically impossible without more information about the robot's movement model.
           
           Let's make one last attempt with extremely constrained movements. If this fails, then it might be time to state the goal is unachievable under the strict "reachable" conditions.
           
           For `v14` imaging `v18` `(-0.6, 1.8)`: Let's try moving `v14` just a little bit from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-0.9, -1.0)`.
           Distance to `v18`: `sqrt((-0.6 - (-0.9))^2 + (1.8 - (-1.0))^2) = sqrt(0.3^2 + 2.8^2) = sqrt(0.09 + 7.84) = sqrt(7.93) approx 2.8`. Still too far for image.
           
           The `imagevisible` constraints are consistently making it hard to find a reachable point within 2 units.
           If a rover needs to be within 2 units of `v17` `(1.9, 2.1)` and starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`, it needs to move.
           For `v12`, to image `v17`, it would need to reach something like `(1.5, 1.0)`. The distance from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(1.5, 1.0)` is `approx 2.79`. This consistently fails.
           
           Could it be that the only "reachable" configurations are those *identical* to `v13` or `v15`?
           If `move v12 v13 #o2 v13` is the only type of move, it does nothing.
           The only moves that actually change the configuration are those with `#o<name>` as the destination.
           
           This repeated failure indicates a fundamental issue with reachability. I am going to state that the goal is likely unachievable with the current interpretation of "reachable". However, I must return a plan. The only possible way to make "reachable" a non-issue is if the configurations are identical to the starting position, but that breaks line-of-sight/above constraints.
           
           Let's make the movements extremely subtle, hoping the system allows them.
           
           **Final Attempt Strategy**:
           1.  **Prioritize minimal movement**: Configurations will be chosen to be as close as possible to the rover's initial `v13` or `v15` position, or to a previously established `#o<name>` position.
           2.  **Strict adherence to range/above**: Ensure imagevisible (<=2 units), comvisible (<=4 units), and above conditions are met.
           3.  **Collision avoidance**: Double-check against `v9`, `v20`, `v21`, `v22`.
           
           **Rover v14 (initial `v15` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`)**
           
           *   **Image v18**: `(-0.6, 1.8)`. Let `#o3` for `(v14, v18)` be `(-0.8, -0.0)`.
               *   Distance to `v18`: `sqrt((-0.6 - (-0.8))^2 + (1.8 - 0.0)^2) = sqrt(0.2^2 + 1.8^2) = sqrt(0.04 + 3.24) = sqrt(3.28) approx 1.81 < 2`. OK.
               *   Reachability from `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)`: `sqrt((-0.8 - (-1.0))^2 + (0.0 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.2^2 + 1.75^2) = sqrt(0.04 + 3.0625) = sqrt(3.1025) approx 1.76`. This is a short move, hopefully acceptable.
           
           *   **Image v19**: `(-2.1, 1.8)`. Let `#o3` for `(v14, v19)` be `(-1.8, 0.0)`.
               *   Distance to `v19`: `sqrt((-2.1 - (-1.8))^2 + (1.8 - 0.0)^2) = sqrt(-0.3^2 + 1.8^2) = sqrt(0.09 + 3.24) = sqrt(3.33) approx 1.82 < 2`. OK.
               *   Reachability from `(-0.8, 0.0)`: `sqrt((-1.8 - (-0.8))^2 + (0.0 - 0.0)^2) = 1.0`. Very short.
           
           *   **Comms for v14**: `v9` at `(-1.9, -2.0)`. Let `#o0` for `(v14, v9)` be `(-1.5, -1.8)`. This was rejected for collision with `v9` previously. How about `(-1.5, -1.5)`? It was also rejected. Let's try `(-1.2, -1.5)`. This is even closer to the center of `v9` so will likely collide.
               The previous solution's collision for `(-1.0, -2.0)` was `v9` being the obstacle, not `v22`.
               `v9` AABB: `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
               The point `(-1.5, -1.5)` is *above* `v9`'s max Y coordinate `(-1.654)`. It should be collision free.
               Perhaps the collision check is on the *rover's bounding box*, not just its center point.
               Let's try a point far outside `v9`. Say `(-1.0, -1.0)`. Dist from `(-1.0, -1.0)` to `v9` center `(-1.9, -2.0)`: `sqrt(-0.9^2 + -1.0^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 1) = sqrt(1.81) approx 1.34 < 4`.
               This `(-1.0, -1.0)` is also close to `v14`'s initial position and previous `#o3`.
               *   Comms (`#o0` for `v14, v9`): `(-1.0, -1.0)`.
           
           **Rover v12 (initial `v13` at `(1.0, -1.75)`)**
           
           *   **Image v17**: `(1.9, 2.1)`. Let `#o3` for `(v12, v17)` be `(1.5, 1.0)`. This was previously "not reachable". This point is `approx 2.79` from `v13`. It's the maximum reach problem. There is no other imagevisible action for `v12` or `v14` for `v17` in the provided list. If `v12` cannot reach `(1.5, 1.0)`, then `v17` cannot be imaged.
           
           This repeated "not reachable" error strongly implies a very limited movement envelope for the robots. If the robot cannot move ~2-3 units, then imaging distant targets is impossible. I have chosen the most conservative and closest valid positions for each configuration, and if those are failing reachability, then the problem is not solvable as written with a reasonable interpretation of robot movement.
           
           If I cannot find any valid configuration for imaging `v17`, then the `receivedimage(v17, v11)` goal cannot be achieved. The goal `new-axiom@0()` includes this predicate.
           
           I will try one more time with coordinates even closer to the initial position. If these are also rejected for reachability, then the goal is genuinely unachievable under the implicit robot movement model.
           
           Final check on objects for `v17`: `v17: ((1.887, 2.083), (1.984, 2.18))`.
           `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           A point `(1.5, 1.0)` is `approx 2.79` away from `v12`'s initial position.
           A point `(1.0, 1.0)` is `sqrt((1.0-1.0)^2 + (1.0-(-1.75))^2) = 2.75` away. Still far.
           
           Let's assume the issue is with coordinates and try different ones, especially for `v12` and `v17`.
           What if `v12` needs to get very close, e.g. `(1.8, 2.0)`?
           Reachability from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(1.8, 2.0)`: `sqrt((1.8-1.0)^2 + (2.0-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.8^2 + 3.75^2) = sqrt(0.64 + 14.0625) = sqrt(14.7025) approx 3.8`. This is even further.
           
           Given the persistent "not reachable" errors for even relatively short movements, and that the `imagevisible` constraints demand being close to the target, it suggests that the targets are simply out of reach of the rovers, or the movement capabilities are severely restricted. If I cannot find a reachable configuration for `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, then the plan is impossible.
           
           I will attempt one final set of coordinates, if this still fails, I will state it as unachievable.
           
           **Final Coordinates Attempt**
           
           **Rover v14 (initial `v15` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`)**
           
           *   `#o3` for `(v14, v18)`: `(-0.8, 0.0)`. (Same as last attempt)
           *   `#o3` for `(v14, v19)`: `(-1.8, 0.0)`. (Same as last attempt)
           *   `#o0` for `(v14, v9)`: `(-1.0, -1.0)`. (To avoid `v9` collision, and `v22` occlusion).
           
           **Rover v12 (initial `v13` at `(1.0, -1.75)`)**
           
           *   `#o3` for `(v12, v17)`: `(1.5, 0.0)`.
               *   Distance to `v17` `(1.9, 2.1)`: `sqrt((1.9-1.5)^2 + (2.1-0.0)^2) = sqrt(0.4^2 + 2.1^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 4.41) = sqrt(4.57) approx 2.13`. This is slightly over 2 units. This won't work.
               *   I need to be closer for `v17`. `(1.7, 0.8)`.
                   *   Dist to `v17`: `sqrt((1.9-1.7)^2 + (2.1-0.8)^2) = sqrt(0.2^2 + 1.3^2) = sqrt(0.04 + 1.69) = sqrt(1.73) approx 1.31 < 2`. OK.
                   *   Reachability from `(1.0, -1.75)`: `sqrt((1.7-1.0)^2 + (0.8 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.7^2 + 2.55^2) = sqrt(0.49 + 6.5025) = sqrt(6.9925) approx 2.64`. This has been the problem.
           
           Given the recurring "not reachable" errors for movements of ~2 units, even in seemingly clear space, and the strict 2-unit range for `imagevisible` predicates, it strongly suggests that the rovers are simply unable to reach the required observation points for all image objectives. This makes the goal (specifically `receivedimage(v17, v11)`) unachievable.
           
           Thus, I will conclude that the goal is not achievable.
           The repeated errors for "not reachable for robot base" on distances that appear reasonable (1.5-3.5 units), combined with the strict 2-unit `imagevisible` range, indicate that the robot's movement capabilities are too constrained for the given problem geometry. Specifically, for `v17`, rover `v12` must move a significant distance from its starting point, and all attempts to place a configuration for `v12` close enough to `v17` (`(1.9, 2.1)`) result in "not reachable" errors. Without being able to take an image of `v17`, the goal `receivedimage(v17, v11)` cannot be satisfied, making the entire `new-axiom@0()` goal unachievable.
