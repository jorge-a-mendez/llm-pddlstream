User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.005, -0.276, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.569, 0.822).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.022, 0.479, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.997, -0.081).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.05, -0.321), (0.04, -0.231)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.018, 0.439), (0.062, 0.519)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.13, 0.242), (-0.042, 0.329)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.086, 0.285, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.989, -0.149).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve the goal of placing objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto surface `v16`.  This seems straightforward at first glance: analyze the initial state, identify the necessary actions (picking and placing the objects), and then formulate the plan.
           
           Initially, I see that I have `v8` at pose `v9` supported by `v11`, `v12` at pose `v13` supported by `v11`, and `v14` at pose `v15` supported by `v11`. All three objects are graspable and stackable on `v16`. Given the goal state's requirement of supporting each object at a pose on v16, I recognize the need to utilize the `pick` and `place` actions which require the `kin` predicate. However, that's where things get tricky.
           
           I immediately spot a critical limitation: the problem statement only allows for action instances within a provided list. Unfortunately, the only action instance allowed is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This move_base action represents no base movement, indicating that the base configuration is sufficient for the pick/place motions.
           
           Given this severe restriction, I run into a roadblock. The `pick` and `place` actions need the `kin` predicate which is not provided in the initial state and cannot be derived with the only permitted action instance.
           
           Since the plan does not contain applicable action instances, the objective cannot be reached. Therefore, the goal `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)` is unreachable under these constraints.
