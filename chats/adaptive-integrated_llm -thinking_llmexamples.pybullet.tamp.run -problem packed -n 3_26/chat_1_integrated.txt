User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.05, -0.321), (0.04, -0.231)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.018, 0.439), (0.062, 0.519)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.086, 0.285, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.989, -0.149).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.005, -0.276, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.569, 0.822).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.022, 0.479, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.997, -0.081).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.13, 0.242), (-0.042, 0.329)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Plan for Object Placement**
           
           My goal is to manipulate the environment to achieve the states `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  This requires moving objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` from their current positions on surface `v11` (specifically at `v9`, `v13`, `v15` respectively) to new positions on surface `v16`. I have analyzed the initial state, the objects, and their properties (graspable, stackable, and their current AABB positions), and the available actions.
           
           The robot's arm, `v4`, is the primary tool for this task, and the base configuration, `v3`, is appropriate for the entire sequence of pick and place operations, as indicated by the available `kin` predicates. The predicates define the possible arm actions for both pick and place operations, using continuous poses (`#o2`) which I must instantiate for each object.
           
           The solution requires a sequential plan:
           
           1.  **Pick and Place v14:** Grab `v14` from its current location (`v15`) and place it on `v16`. I will assign the continuous pose value for `v14` on `v16` as `(-0.087, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           2.  **Pick and Place v8:** Grab `v8` from its current location (`v9`) and place it on `v16`. I will assign the continuous pose value for `v8` on `v16` as `(0.005, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           3.  **Pick and Place v12:** Grab `v12` from its current location (`v13`) and place it on `v16`. I will assign the continuous pose value for `v12` on `v16` as `(0.092, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           
           These pose values are based on detailed spatial analysis to fit the objects on `v16` within its boundaries (AABB) without collisions, with small buffers.  The height (`z = 0.781`) is assumed, based on the `v11` surface height.
           
           The plan will be implemented using the `pick` and `place` actions, leveraging the predefined `kin` predicates, with each action executed sequentially. The plan is collision-free and utilizes the available resources in the most efficient manner, resulting in a total cost of 6.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Plan's Flaw and the Impossibility of the Task**
           
           Okay, so I messed up. The user pointed out that my previous plan included actions outside the permissible set. I was provided a list of actions I could use, and I completely disregarded that. The only allowed action instance is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.
           
           Looking closer, this means the robot can only execute a `move_base` command, moving from point `v3` to itself. In effect, it does *nothing* to change the robot's configuration. This is going to be a problem.
           
           The target state I'm aiming for is `on(v8, v16) and on(v12, v16) and on(v14, v16)`.  The starting point is a configuration where v8, v12, and v14 are *already* on v11.
           
           To get those objects onto v16, I'd need to use `pick` and `place` actions, which clearly *aren't* on the allowed list. Given that the only thing I *can* do is a null `move_base` action, it's immediately obvious that I can't possibly achieve the goal. No way to modify the arrangement of objects on the surfaces. It's simply unreachable with these restrictions.
