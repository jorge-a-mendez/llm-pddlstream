           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.05, -0.321), (0.04, -0.231)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.018, 0.439), (0.062, 0.519)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.086, 0.285, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.989, -0.149).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.005, -0.276, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.569, 0.822).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.022, 0.479, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.997, -0.081).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.13, 0.242), (-0.042, 0.329)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've devised to achieve the goal of placing objects v8, v12, and v14 onto surface v16.**
           
           First, let's establish my approach. The core strategy hinges on the standard "pick and place" paradigm, where the robot's arm, specifically v4, will sequentially pick each object from its initial location and place it onto the target surface. Each object's initial location is represented by poses v9, v13, and v15, and I need to place them at specific locations on v16, which I'll denote as `#o2`.
           
           The initial state provides me with some key insights. All objects, v8, v12, and v14, are currently on the v11 surface, which seems to be a larger working area. The robot's base (v3) is at a location that isn't ideal for the pick and place operations, so I must consider moving it closer. I have access to three available actions, `move_base`, `pick`, and `place`, and two robot arms. The crucial consideration here is where to place objects on the smaller target surface v16, and the need to avoid collisions. The problem states, if multiple objects need to be placed at the same pose starting with '#', I need to provide a different continuous value for each object at that pose.
           
           My plan unfolds in a series of logical steps:
           
           1.  **Base Movement:** Begin by repositioning the robot's base from its starting position (v3) to a more advantageous location (#o3). This base motion uses the `move_base` action and leverages the given `basemotion` predicates. This location (#o3) is strategically selected for optimal reachability to the initial and final poses, simplifying subsequent pick and place procedures.
           2.  **Object Retrieval and Placement:** The next set of actions involves a repeating pattern of pick and place for each of the target objects v8, v12, and v14:
               *   **Pick:** Use the `pick` action with arm `v4`, object `?o`, and its current pose.
               *   **Place:** Use the `place` action with arm `v4`, object `?o`, and its new pose on `v16`.
           
           Let's carefully consider the proposed poses on v16. To ensure a stable and collision-free arrangement, I will calculate the precise coordinates. Surface v16's footprint is ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). I'll position the objects sequentially, ensuring they don't overlap. Since the provided z-coordinate for all existing poses is 0.781, I will ensure the new placed object positions share that z-coordinate as well (z=0.781) to align with existing poses and maintain a stable placement on v16.
           
           *   **v12:** Placement `(-0.089, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           *   **v8:** Placement `(-0.005, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           *   **v14:** Placement `(0.084, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           
           These positions guarantee that each object occupies a distinct area on the surface without any overlap.
           
           Now, let's detail the sequence of actions:
           
           1.  Move the base from v3 to #o3.
           2.  Pick v12 from v13 and place it on v16 at position (-0.089, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0).
           3.  Pick v14 from v15 and place it on v16 at position (0.084, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0).
           4.  Pick v8 from v9 and place it on v16 at position (-0.005, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0).
           
           With these actions, I can successfully execute the goal of placing all the designated objects on the surface v16 and ensure they will be collision free.
