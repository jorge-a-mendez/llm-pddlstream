           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27x0.27. The object is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.098x0.098. This means the object is significantly smaller than the surface, offering many possible stable placements.
           
           I will try to place the object on the center of the surface at different rotations. Then I will try to place it in various positions around the surface while maintaining stability. The object can be rotated by any angle, but due to its square shape, rotations by multiples of 90 degrees (pi/2 radians) will result in the same bounding box on the surface. However, a slight rotation will change the corners of the object, which might be useful if there are unknown obstacles. I will prioritize placements where the object is fully on the surface and centered, and then move to edge cases.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface (0.27x0.27) centered at the origin.
           There is now an object (ID 6) already placed at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) with dimensions approximately 0.098x0.098.
           The new object (ID 5) is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.086x0.086.
           
           I need to place object 5 on surface 0, ensuring it's stable and does not collide with object 6. Since object 6 is centered at (0,0) and is roughly 0.098x0.098, it occupies the region from approximately -0.049 to 0.049 in both x and y.
           
           The new object (ID 5) has a size of 0.086. So, its half-size is 0.043. This means it will collide if its center is too close to (0,0). For instance, if object 5 is placed at (0.0, 0.0), its extent would be from -0.043 to 0.043, which overlaps with object 6.
           
           To avoid collision, the center of object 5 must be far enough from the center of object 6.
           If placed without rotation, the minimum distance from the center of object 5 to the center of object 6 along an axis would be (0.0984/2) + (0.0866/2) = 0.0492 + 0.0433 = 0.0925.
           
           I will try to place object 5 at the edges of the surface, away from the center, to avoid collision with object 6. Since the surface spans from -0.135 to 0.135, and object 5 is 0.086 wide, the maximum extent of its half-width is 0.043. So, for example, an x-coordinate of 0.135 - 0.043 = 0.092 would place its edge exactly at the surface edge. I will choose positions that keep it slightly inwards for safety, e.g., 0.07 or 0.08.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface (0.27x0.27) centered at the origin.
           There are now two objects already placed:
           - Object 6 (0.098x0.098) at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
           - Object 5 (0.086x0.086) at (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0)
           
           The new object (ID 4) is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.087x0.087.
           
           I need to place object 4 on surface 0, ensuring it's stable and does not collide with object 6 or object 5.
           - Object 6: centered at (0,0), spans approximately x: [-0.0492, 0.0492], y: [-0.0492, 0.0492].
           - Object 5: centered at (0.08, 0.0), spans approximately x: [0.08 - 0.0433, 0.08 + 0.0433] = [0.0367, 0.1233], y: [-0.0433, 0.0433].
           
           The new object 4 has a half-size of approximately 0.087/2 = 0.0435.
           - To avoid collision with object 6, the center of object 4 must be more than (0.0492 + 0.0435) = 0.0927 away from (0,0) along the x or y axis.
           - To avoid collision with object 5, the center of object 4 must be more than (0.0433 + 0.0435) = 0.0868 away from (0.08, 0.0).
           
           This means the central region and the region around (0.08, 0.0) are occupied.
           The surface spans from -0.135 to 0.135.
           I will try placing object 4 in the negative x direction, or in the y direction to avoid existing objects. A position like (-0.08, 0.0) or (0.0, -0.08) seems plausible.
           Let's analyze potential collision for (-0.08, 0.0) for object 4:
           - With object 6 (center 0,0, half_size 0.0492): center distance is 0.08. Collision threshold is 0.0492 + 0.0435 = 0.0927. 0.08 < 0.0927, so this would collide.
           My initial collision estimate for square objects was not precise enough. For axis-aligned bounding boxes, collision occurs if `abs(center1.x - center2.x) < (half_size1.x + half_size2.x)` AND `abs(center1.y - center2.y) < (half_size1.y + half_size2.y)`.
           
           Let's re-evaluate more carefully.
           Object 6 (ID 6): center (0,0), half-extents (0.0492, 0.0492). Bounding box: [-0.0492, 0.0492] x [-0.0492, 0.0492].
           Object 5 (ID 5): center (0.08,0), half-extents (0.0433, 0.0433). Bounding box: [0.0367, 0.1233] x [-0.0433, 0.0433].
           New Object (ID 4): half-extents (0.04365, 0.04365).
           
           A placement for Object 4 at (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0) for example (the previous placement for ID 5 that was successful) would now collide with object 5. I need to find new, unoccupied regions.
           
           Let's try placing object 4 at:
           - (0.0, -0.08):
               - With object 6: dx=0, dy=0.08. abs(dx) < 0.0492+0.04365=0.09285 (True). abs(dy) < 0.09285 (0.08 < 0.09285, True). This would collide with object 6.
           - Let's try to place it further away. Max coord for surface is 0.135. Half-size for object 4 is 0.04365.
             So max center is 0.135 - 0.04365 = 0.09135. Let's try 0.09.
           - How about (0.09, 0.0)?
               - With object 6 (0,0): dx=0.09, dy=0. abs(dx) < 0.09285 (False, 0.09 is not < 0.09285, it means it would collide if I use <, but it doesn't mean it won't. I need to check for non-overlap).
                 If the distance between centers is >= sum of half sizes, there's no collision.
                 For X: abs(0.09 - 0) = 0.09. Sum of half-sizes = 0.0492 + 0.04365 = 0.09285. Since 0.09 < 0.09285, there is an X overlap.
                 For Y: abs(0 - 0) = 0. Sum of half-sizes = 0.0492 + 0.04365 = 0.09285. Since 0 < 0.09285, there is a Y overlap.
                 Both overlap, so (0.09, 0.0) collides with object 6.
           
           Let's reconsider the collision logic for square objects.
           If two square objects of side `s1` and `s2` are placed at `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` with no rotation. They collide if
           `abs(x1 - x2) < (s1/2 + s2/2)` AND `abs(y1 - y2) < (s1/2 + s2/2)`.
           
           Object 6 (s=0.0984): center (0,0), half_s=0.0492.
           Object 5 (s=0.0867): center (0.08,0), half_s=0.04335.
           Object 4 (s=0.0873): half_s=0.04365.
           
           Let's test a placement for Object 4 at (0,0.09).
           - With Object 6 (0,0):
               - abs(0-0) = 0 < (0.0492 + 0.04365) = 0.09285 (Y overlap)
               - abs(0.09-0) = 0.09 < (0.0492 + 0.04365) = 0.09285 (X overlap)
               - Collision with Object 6.
           
           This implies the space around the origin is quite constrained.
           Need to place object 4 such that its center is sufficiently far from (0,0) and (0.08,0).
           
           Let's find the regions of non-overlap.
           Region occupied by Obj 6: x: [-0.0492, 0.0492], y: [-0.0492, 0.0492]
           Region occupied by Obj 5: x: [0.08-0.04335, 0.08+0.04335] = [0.03665, 0.12335], y: [-0.04335, 0.04335]
           
           Consider the 'corridors' or corners of the surface.
           The surface is [-0.135, 0.135] x [-0.135, 0.135].
           The new object (ID 4) has half-size 0.04365.
           So, its center `(cx,cy)` must satisfy:
           `abs(cx) <= 0.135 - 0.04365 = 0.09135`
           `abs(cy) <= 0.135 - 0.04365 = 0.09135`
           
           Let's try a placement for Object 4 at (-0.08, 0.08).
           - Collision with Object 6: center (0,0)
               - X-axis: abs(-0.08 - 0) = 0.08. Sum of half-sizes = 0.0492 + 0.04365 = 0.09285. 0.08 < 0.09285 (overlap).
               - Y-axis: abs(0.08 - 0) = 0.08. Sum of half-sizes = 0.0492 + 0.04365 = 0.09285. 0.08 < 0.09285 (overlap).
               - Collides with object 6.
           
           This is getting tricky. The objects are relatively large compared to the available space and each other. The object half-sizes are around 0.04-0.05.
           The sum of half-sizes (0.04365 for new object and 0.0492 for obj6) is 0.09285. This means the new object's center must be more than 0.09285 away from the center of obj 6 (0,0) in both X and Y directions to avoid axis-aligned collision. This implies that if it's placed along an axis, its center needs to be at least 0.09285 away.
           So, (0.09285, 0) is the minimum x-position along the x-axis to avoid collision with object 6. This is too close to the edge (0.09135).
           This means that, if axis aligned, the new object cannot be placed along the x or y axes very close to the center if object 6 is at (0,0).
           
           Let's try placing it in one of the corners of the surface.
           For example, a center at (0.09, 0.09).
           - Check against Object 6 (0,0):
               - X-axis: abs(0.09 - 0) = 0.09. Sum half-sizes = 0.09285. 0.09 < 0.09285 (overlap).
               - Y-axis: abs(0.09 - 0) = 0.09. Sum half-sizes = 0.09285. 0.09 < 0.09285 (overlap).
               - Collides with object 6.
           
           It seems I'm consistently underestimating the overlap. If one of the previous placements failed, it means my collision estimates for "no rotation" are still off. Let's assume rotations make the effective size of the object larger on the surface in axis-aligned terms (which they do, a square rotated by 45 degrees has a larger diagonal as its effective axis-aligned side).
           Let's consider axis-aligned collision for square objects only first to simplify.
           
           The effective bounding box of a square object of side 's' rotated by theta is:
           `rotated_s_x = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`
           `rotated_s_y = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`
           So half-size is `s/2 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.
           For theta = 0, half-size is s/2.
           For theta = pi/4 (45 degrees), `cos(pi/4)=sin(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2`. So `(sqrt(2)/2 + sqrt(2)/2) = sqrt(2)`.
           Effective half-size becomes `s/2 * sqrt(2)`.
           
           Let's re-calculate half-sizes including maximum rotation for collision calculation:
           - Obj 6 (s=0.0984): `max_half_s = 0.0492 * sqrt(2) = 0.06958`
           - Obj 5 (s=0.0867): `max_half_s = 0.04335 * sqrt(2) = 0.06131`
           - Obj 4 (s=0.0873): `max_half_s = 0.04365 * sqrt(2) = 0.06173`
           
           These are for worst-case rotation (45 degrees). When objects are axis-aligned, their actual half-sizes are smaller.
           The given successful placements are at 0 rotation, so I should use the non-rotated half-sizes for collision checks for those objects.
           
           Object 6 (ID 6): center (0,0), half-extents (0.0492, 0.0492).
           Object 5 (ID 5): center (0.08,0), half-extents (0.04335, 0.04335).
           New Object (ID 4): half-extents (0.04365, 0.04365) (if unrotated).
           
           Surface bounds: x: [-0.135, 0.135], y: [-0.135, 0.135].
           Max center coordinate for ID 4 (unrotated) = 0.135 - 0.04365 = 0.09135.
           
           Let's try a placement for Object 4 at (-0.09, 0.09). This is near a corner of the surface.
           - Check against Object 6 (0,0):
               - X-axis: abs(-0.09 - 0) = 0.09. Sum of half-sizes = 0.0492 + 0.04365 = 0.09285. Since 0.09 < 0.09285, there is X overlap.
               - Y-axis: abs(0.09 - 0) = 0.09. Sum of half-sizes = 0.0492 + 0.04365 = 0.09285. Since 0.09 < 0.09285, there is Y overlap.
               - So, still collides with object 6.
           
           This means that for axis-aligned object 4, the center must be *at least* 0.09285 away from the origin in both x and y directions to avoid collision with object 6.
           This value (0.09285) is greater than the maximum possible center coordinate (0.09135) to stay on the surface.
           This means that if object 6 is at (0,0) and object 4 is unrotated, it *must* overlap with object 6's X or Y range if placed such that it fits on the surface.
           This sounds like there is no stable, non-colliding axis-aligned placement for object 4 with object 6, if object 4's center is on an axis passing through the origin.
           However, if object 4 is placed in a corner, say (cx,cy) where `cx > 0.09285` and `cy > 0.09285`, then it could avoid collision.
           But wait, `cx` and `cy` cannot be greater than 0.09135.
           
           This means that an unrotated object 4 *will* always collide with object 6 if object 6 is at (0,0) and object 4 is placed on the surface.
           Let's double-check the logic.
           Object 6 BB: [-0.0492, 0.0492] x [-0.0492, 0.0492]
           Object 4 BB if center at (cx,cy) and unrotated: [cx-0.04365, cx+0.04365] x [cy-0.04365, cy+0.04365]
           Collision condition:
           `max(x1_lower, x2_lower) < min(x1_upper, x2_upper)` AND `max(y1_lower, y2_lower) < min(y1_upper, y2_upper)`
           
           If object 4 center at (cx,cy):
           No collision in X if: `cx+0.04365 <= -0.0492` OR `cx-0.04365 >= 0.0492`
           Which simplifies to: `cx <= -0.0492 - 0.04365 = -0.09285` OR `cx >= 0.0492 + 0.04365 = 0.09285`
           Similarly for Y: `cy <= -0.09285` OR `cy >= 0.09285`
           
           So for NO collision with object 6 (unrotated): `(abs(cx) >= 0.09285)` AND `(abs(cy) >= 0.09285)`.
           But we know that `abs(cx) <= 0.09135` and `abs(cy) <= 0.09135` to stay on the surface.
           Since `0.09135 < 0.09285`, it's impossible to satisfy `abs(cx) >= 0.09285` and `abs(cy) >= 0.09285` while staying on the surface.
           This means an unrotated object 4 *always* collides with object 6 if both are axis aligned.
           
           This is a critical insight. Since the successful placements (6 and 5) were axis-aligned (theta=0), I should assume that the object itself is also axis-aligned when placed.
           This means I must use a rotation for Object 4.
           If I rotate Object 4 by pi/4 (45 degrees), its effective axis-aligned half-size becomes 0.04365 * sqrt(2) = 0.06173.
           Then, to fit on the surface, its center must satisfy: `abs(cx) <= 0.135 - 0.06173 = 0.07327`.
           And to avoid collision with Object 6 (unrotated, half_s=0.0492):
           `abs(cx) >= 0.0492 + 0.06173 = 0.11093` OR `abs(cy) >= 0.0492 + 0.06173 = 0.11093`
           Since `0.07327 < 0.11093`, it seems even with rotation, it's impossible to avoid collision with object 6 if it's placed on the same surface.
           
           This implies there might be an issue with my understanding or that the problem is unsolvable with these assumptions.
           Let's assume the collision check is only for the actual, unrotated bounding box of the objects, even if they are placed with rotation. This is usually how these problems are set up unless "object geometry" implies its actual mesh and not just AABB. The prompt says "x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)", which implies the *unrotated* AABB. And collision checks against fixed obstacles usually consider the true geometry if that's what's provided for the object.
           
           If the collision check uses the AABB of the *rotated* object, then my previous logic stands.
           If the collision check uses the *original AABB* for the object regardless of its placement rotation, then it means that if the object is placed at (x,y,theta), its AABB *for collision* is still (x,y) with (size_x, size_y). This is a less common interpretation but could be the case in some simulation contexts. However, the feedback "collides with fixed obstacles" typically means the actual occupied space of the object in its placed configuration.
           
           Let's assume the standard interpretation: a placed object's bounding box changes with rotation.
           So, if Object 4 is rotated by 0, its half-size is 0.04365.
           If Object 4 is rotated by pi/4, its effective half-size for an axis-aligned bounding box is 0.06173.
           
           The success of (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) for object 6 and (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0) for object 5 means:
           - Object 6 BB: [-0.0492, 0.0492] x [-0.0492, 0.0492]
           - Object 5 BB: [0.03665, 0.12335] x [-0.04335, 0.04335]
           
           These two objects are distinct and do not collide.
           Let's check:
           Overlap X: max(-0.0492, 0.03665) = 0.03665. min(0.0492, 0.12335) = 0.0492.
           0.03665 < 0.0492, so there's an X overlap.
           Overlap Y: max(-0.0492, -0.04335) = -0.04335. min(0.0492, 0.04335) = 0.04335.
           -0.04335 < 0.04335, so there's a Y overlap.
           Since there's both X and Y overlap, Object 6 and Object 5 *do* collide.
           
           This is a critical contradiction. The previous feedback explicitly states that `(ID: 6) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0` and `(ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0` were "successes" and "did not collide with fixed obstacles". However, my AABB collision check says they *do* collide.
           
           This means one of my assumptions is wrong:
           1. The collision check is not a simple AABB overlap for previously placed objects.
           2. The feedback "did not collide with fixed obstacles" implies there are *other* objects that are not moving, but these successfully placed objects are *not* considered fixed obstacles in the same way. The task says "avoid collision between objects i and j". This implies my AABB check is necessary.
           3. The "extents" given for the object are not the AABB, or the AABB is not what's used for collision. This is unlikely given the phrasing.
           4. There is a "tolerance" in the collision detection not provided.
           
           Given that the previous placements were successful, despite my AABB collision check saying they should collide, I must adjust my collision reasoning.
           Perhaps the success feedback implies that the problem statement "avoid collision between objects i and j" only applies to the *new* object being placed with *all* existing objects, but existing objects don't check for collision among themselves.
           
           Let's use the explicit feedback that Object 6 at (0,0,0,0) and Object 5 at (0,0,0.08,0) are both valid, non-colliding placements.
           This implies that my AABB collision logic might be too conservative, or there's a specific geometry that makes them not collide. Since they are square and axis-aligned, an AABB overlap implies collision.
           
           What if the provided extents are for the *minimum* bounding box, and the actual geometric object is slightly smaller, or has rounded corners? The prompt says "x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)". This should be definitive.
           
           Could it be that the collision is only detected if the *centers* are within a certain distance?
           For Object 6 (center 0,0, half_s=0.0492) and Object 5 (center 0.08,0, half_s=0.04335):
           - X distance between centers: 0.08. Sum of half-sizes: 0.0492 + 0.04335 = 0.09255.
           - Y distance between centers: 0. Sum of half-sizes: 0.0492 + 0.04335 = 0.09255.
           My AABB collision check found X overlap (0.08 < 0.09255) and Y overlap (0 < 0.09255). This means they collide.
           
           If they did not collide, then for an axis-aligned AABB check, it means either:
           `abs(x1-x2) >= (s1/2 + s2/2)` OR `abs(y1-y2) >= (s1/2 + s2/2)`
           
           Given the feedback that they *don't* collide, the system's collision detection must be different from my understanding of AABB overlap.
           Perhaps the objects are just points for collision purposes, or some other simplified geometry. But then "AABB" would be misleading.
           
           Let's assume the problem means "your placement must not cause any *new* collision, and prior successful placements are considered fine *relative to each other*". This interpretation is common in some challenges.
           So, I need to find a placement for object 4 that does not collide with object 6 *or* object 5, *given their current successful positions*.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the collision zones based on the successful placements.
           Object 6 BB: [-0.0492, 0.0492] x [-0.0492, 0.0492]
           Object 5 BB: [0.03665, 0.12335] x [-0.04335, 0.04335]
           
           The new object (ID 4) has half-extents (0.04365, 0.04365) when unrotated.
           Let's try placing object 4 at a position like (-0.08, -0.08).
           Max center for object 4 (unrotated) is (0.09135, 0.09135).
           So (-0.08, -0.08) is within surface bounds.
           
           Let's check collision for Object 4 at (-0.08, -0.08) with Obj 6 (0,0):
           - X overlap: abs(-0.08 - 0) = 0.08. Sum of half-sizes = 0.0492 + 0.04365 = 0.09285. Since 0.08 < 0.09285, X overlaps.
           - Y overlap: abs(-0.08 - 0) = 0.08. Sum of half-sizes = 0.0492 + 0.04365 = 0.09285. Since 0.08 < 0.09285, Y overlaps.
           According to my AABB logic, this *collides* with object 6.
           
           Given the contradiction in the previous feedback, I will proceed by *trying* placements based on my AABB collision logic, and if they fail, then the problem is more complex than simple AABB. If they succeed, it suggests my logic is mostly right but perhaps the system has a small tolerance, or the successful previous placements are a red herring about collision between those specific objects.
           
           If object 6 and object 5 are *not* colliding in the system, it suggests that the actual collision detection might have a safety margin, or maybe it refers to collision only if they *touch* and not just overlap.
           
           Let's try placing object 4 in a quadrant that is less occupied. The first quadrant (positive X, positive Y) has some space, but X is occupied by Object 5.
           The third quadrant (negative X, negative Y) is relatively free.
           Let's place Object 4's center at `(-0.08, -0.08)`.
           If my previous collision logic for 6 and 5 was wrong because they *don't* collide, then my collision logic for 6 and 4 must also be re-evaluated.
           If (0,0) and (0.08,0) are fine for objects of those sizes, then the "collision threshold" (sum of half-sizes) might not apply directly.
           
           Let's use a simpler heuristic for placement for now, since my precise geometric reasoning seems at odds with the feedback. I will try to maximize distance from existing objects.
           Object 6: (0,0)
           Object 5: (0.08,0)
           
           I will try placing object 4 on the far negative x side, or far positive y side, or far negative y side.
           
           - Try (0, 0.0, -0.09, 0.0): This puts it on the far left.
               - Check with Obj 6 (0,0): dx=0.09, dy=0. My previous collision check said 0.09 < 0.09285, so it would collide.
               - Check with Obj 5 (0.08,0): dx=abs(-0.09-0.08)=0.17. Sum of half-sizes=0.04335+0.04365=0.087. 0.17 > 0.087, so no X overlap. dy=0. Sum of half-sizes=0.087. 0 < 0.087, so Y overlap. No collision since only Y overlaps.
               - If the system allows objects 6 and 5 not to collide, then it could allow this. I will generate placements based on what seems "far enough" from current objects, even if my calculated AABB overlap says otherwise for the previous successful placements.
           
           Let's assume that object 6 and 5 being successful mean their actual bounding boxes don't overlap as far as the problem is concerned. This means my AABB calculation might be off, or there's a small tolerance.
           If object 6's AABB is [-0.0492, 0.0492]x[-0.0492, 0.0492] and object 5's AABB is [0.03665, 0.12335]x[-0.04335, 0.04335].
           The overlapping region would be x: [0.03665, 0.0492], y: [-0.04335, 0.04335]. This is a non-empty rectangle.
           
           Let's try to find an area that is clearly outside the BB of 6 and 5.
           Obj 6 X-range: [-0.0492, 0.0492]
           Obj 5 X-range: [0.03665, 0.12335]
           
           A safe X-range would be `x < -0.0492 - half_size_4` or `x > 0.12335 + half_size_4`.
           `x < -0.0492 - 0.04365 = -0.09285`
           `x > 0.12335 + 0.04365 = 0.167` (this is outside surface bounds as max center is 0.09135)
           
           So, for X, a center for Object 4 needs to be `cx <= -0.09285`.
           The maximum allowed `cx` is `0.09135`. This means it won't fit entirely to the left to fully avoid object 6 without overlap in X.
           This is still very confusing given the feedback.
           
           Let's rethink: the successful feedback means that these object AABBs *do not collide in the problem's definition*.
           Therefore, the collision definition of the problem is *not* standard AABB overlap.
           What else could it be?
           - Maybe only center points are considered, with a distance threshold that is not sum of half-sizes?
           - Maybe there's a specific, smaller object geometry not revealed?
           
           I will assume that my previous AABB overlap calculation is correct in general, but the problem's collision detection for previously placed objects allows for some overlap. Since the problem asks me to avoid *new* collisions, I will still use my AABB collision check. If my check is too strict, the placements will be valid. If it's too lenient, they will fail. The only way to learn is to provide placements.
           
           Let's try to place object 4 at (-0.09, 0).
           - Collision with Obj 6 (0,0):
               - X: abs(-0.09 - 0) = 0.09. Sum of half-sizes = 0.0492 + 0.04365 = 0.09285. This means X overlaps (0.09 < 0.09285).
               - Y: abs(0 - 0) = 0. Sum of half-sizes = 0.09285. This means Y overlaps (0 < 0.09285).
               - My AABB says collision. But if (0.08,0) was fine for Obj 5, why not (-0.09,0) for Obj 4?
               - The centers are (0,0) and (0.08,0). X-distance 0.08. Sum of half-sizes: 0.0492+0.04335 = 0.09255.
               - For Object 6 & 5, X-overlap: 0.08 < 0.09255. Y-overlap: 0 < 0.09255. Both collide by my rule.
               - The rule must be different.
           
           What if the rule is `center_distance >= s1/2 + s2/2` is required *only if the objects are overlapping in the other dimension*?
           This is also complicated.
           
           Let's assume that the collision detection for existing objects (6 and 5) and the new object (4) works as if there's a small margin of error (a buffer zone) or a slightly smaller effective size for collision.
           For example, if the buffer is 0.005.
           Then object 6 effective half_size = 0.0492 - 0.005 = 0.0442
           Object 5 effective half_size = 0.04335 - 0.005 = 0.03835
           Object 4 effective half_size = 0.04365 - 0.005 = 0.03865
           
           Collision between 6 and 5 with this tolerance:
           X: 0.08. Sum of effective half-sizes: 0.0442 + 0.03835 = 0.08255. Still, 0.08 < 0.08255, so X overlap.
           Y: 0. Sum of effective half-sizes: 0.0442 + 0.03835 = 0.08255. Still, 0 < 0.08255, so Y overlap.
           This still leads to collision.
           
           I am forced to conclude that the collision detection logic for previous placements is *not* a simple AABB overlap.
           Therefore, my only path is to propose placements that intuitively seem "open" and far from previous ones, and learn from the feedback.
           
           Let's try placing object 4 in the corners and along the edges, far from (0,0) and (0.08,0).
           The max center coordinate for Object 4 (unrotated) is 0.09135.
           Let's try:
           (0, 0.0, -0.09, 0.0) -> far left.
           (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.09) -> far bottom.
           (0, 0.0, -0.09, -0.09) -> bottom-left corner.
           (0, 0.0, -0.09, 0.09) -> top-left corner.
           (0, 0.0, 0.09, -0.09) -> bottom-right corner.
           The last one (0.09, -0.09) might be interesting.
           Check with Object 6 (0,0):
           - X: abs(0.09 - 0) = 0.09. If previous feedback allows 0.08 to be clear, 0.09 might be clear.
           - Y: abs(-0.09 - 0) = 0.09. Same logic.
           Check with Object 5 (0.08,0):
           - X: abs(0.09 - 0.08) = 0.01. Sum of half-sizes = 0.04335 + 0.04365 = 0.087. So X overlaps (0.01 < 0.087).
           - Y: abs(-0.09 - 0) = 0.09. Sum of half-sizes = 0.087. So Y does not overlap (0.09 > 0.087).
           This placement (0.09, -0.09) should *not* collide with Object 5 because the Y-overlap condition is not met according to my AABB rule.
           
           Let's try to populate the available space systematically using positions that are far from the existing objects.
           The available space is surface 0: x in [-0.135, 0.135], y in [-0.135, 0.135].
           Object 6 is at (0,0). Object 5 is at (0.08,0).
           Let's use the extreme available coordinates for object 4 center as long as it fits: `abs(cx/cy) <= 0.09135`.
           
           Placements:

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface (0.27x0.27) centered at the origin.
           There are now three objects successfully placed:
           - Object 6 (0.0984x0.0984) at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
           - Object 5 (0.0867x0.0867) at (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0)
           - Object 4 (0.0873x0.0873) at (0, 0.0, -0.09, 0.0)
           
           All existing objects are placed with theta=0 (axis-aligned).
           The new object (ID 7) is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0983x0.0983. Its half-size (unrotated) is 0.0983/2 = 0.04915.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the AABB collision logic based on the *successful* placements.
           Object 6: Center (0,0), Half-size (0.0492, 0.0492). BB: [-0.0492, 0.0492] x [-0.0492, 0.0492].
           Object 5: Center (0.08,0), Half-size (0.04335, 0.04335). BB: [0.03665, 0.12335] x [-0.04335, 0.04335].
           Object 4: Center (-0.09,0), Half-size (0.04365, 0.04365). BB: [-0.13365, -0.04635] x [-0.04365, 0.04365].
           
           Let's check for AABB overlaps between existing successful placements:
           1. Obj 6 and Obj 5:
              - X-overlap: max(-0.0492, 0.03665) = 0.03665. min(0.0492, 0.12335) = 0.0492. (0.03665 < 0.0492) -> X overlap.
              - Y-overlap: max(-0.0492, -0.04335) = -0.04335. min(0.0492, 0.04335) = 0.04335. (-0.04335 < 0.04335) -> Y overlap.
              - My AABB rule still says they *collide*. Yet, they were successful.
           
           2. Obj 6 and Obj 4:
              - X-overlap: max(-0.0492, -0.13365) = -0.0492. min(0.0492, -0.04635) = -0.04635. (-0.0492 < -0.04635) -> X overlap.
              - Y-overlap: max(-0.0492, -0.04365) = -0.04365. min(0.0492, 0.04365) = 0.04365. (-0.04365 < 0.04365) -> Y overlap.
              - My AABB rule still says they *collide*. Yet, they were successful.
           
           3. Obj 5 and Obj 4:
              - X-overlap: max(0.03665, -0.13365) = 0.03665. min(0.12335, -0.04635) = -0.04635. (0.03665 > -0.04635) -> NO X overlap.
              - Since there is no X overlap, they do not collide by my AABB rule. This is consistent with them both being successful.
           
           Conclusion: The problem's collision detection for placed objects is more permissive than a strict AABB overlap. There seems to be a gap/tolerance between objects when they are very close.
           For instance, for Obj 6 (center 0,0, half_s=0.0492) and Obj 5 (center 0.08,0, half_s=0.04335):
           The sum of half-sizes in X is 0.0492 + 0.04335 = 0.09255. The center distance is 0.08.
           The overlap (0.09255 - 0.08) = 0.01255. This is the amount of 'forgiveness' or gap.
           Similarly for Obj 6 (center 0,0, half_s=0.0492) and Obj 4 (center -0.09,0, half_s=0.04365):
           The sum of half-sizes in X is 0.0492 + 0.04365 = 0.09285. The center distance is 0.09.
           The overlap (0.09285 - 0.09) = 0.00285.
           
           This implies that if the overlap is small, it's considered non-colliding. The "gap" size seems to be around 0.01 to 0.003.
           Given this, I should try to place the new object (ID 7) in regions that are "mostly" free, even if they have minor AABB overlap by my strict calculations.
           Object 7 (ID 7) half-size (unrotated) = 0.04915.
           Max center for ID 7 (unrotated) = 0.135 - 0.04915 = 0.08585.
           
           Current occupied regions (based on previous successes, assuming they define "occupied" for the system):
           - Near (0,0) by Obj 6.
           - Near (0.08,0) by Obj 5.
           - Near (-0.09,0) by Obj 4.
           
           The entire X-axis of the surface from approx -0.13 to 0.13 is covered by these objects' Y-bands.
           Obj 6 X: [-0.0492, 0.0492]
           Obj 5 X: [0.03665, 0.12335]
           Obj 4 X: [-0.13365, -0.04635]
           
           Combined X-occupation for Y=0 (or small Y offset):
           [-0.13365, 0.12335]. This covers most of the surface along the Y=0 line!
           The total surface X span is 0.27. The combined span is 0.12335 - (-0.13365) = 0.257.
           This leaves very little space along the X-axis for new objects.
           
           The remaining "corners" or "edges" of the surface along the Y-axis are better candidates.
           Try to place ID 7 far in the positive Y direction, or negative Y direction.
           For example, (0.0, 0.08).
           - Check against Obj 6 (0,0): dx=0, dy=0.08. Sum of half-sizes (0.0492+0.04915) = 0.09835.
               - X overlap: 0 < 0.09835 (collides).
               - Y overlap: 0.08 < 0.09835 (collides).
               - This would collide by my strict AABB rule. But based on previous feedback, an overlap of 0.01835 (0.09835 - 0.08) might be acceptable. This is slightly larger than the previous successful overlaps.
           
           Let's try to place it at the maximum y position possible.
           Max center for ID 7 along Y (unrotated) = 0.08585. So (0, 0.085) or (0, -0.085).
           Placement at (0, 0.085):
           - Check with Obj 6 (0,0): dx=0, dy=0.085. Sum of half-sizes 0.09835. Overlap in Y: 0.09835 - 0.085 = 0.01335. This is similar to the (6,5) overlap.
           - Check with Obj 5 (0.08,0): dx=0.08, dy=0.085. Sum of half-sizes (0.04335+0.04915)=0.0925.
               - X: 0.08 < 0.0925 (X overlap, 0.0125).
               - Y: 0.085 < 0.0925 (Y overlap, 0.0075).
               - Both X and Y overlap, so collision. This overlap (0.0125 and 0.0075) could be small enough.
           - Check with Obj 4 (-0.09,0): dx=0.09, dy=0.085. Sum of half-sizes (0.04365+0.04915)=0.0928.
               - X: 0.09 < 0.0928 (X overlap, 0.0028).
               - Y: 0.085 < 0.0928 (Y overlap, 0.0078).
               - Both X and Y overlap, so collision. These overlaps are very small.
           
           Given the precedent of acceptable overlaps, I will try placements that minimize the overlap, prioritizing large gaps.
           I'll try to find placements in the corners of the surface.
           Let's try center coordinates `(cx, cy)` such that `abs(cx)` and `abs(cy)` are large.
           Max center is 0.08585. Let's use 0.08.
           Consider (0.08, 0.08).
           - Collision with Obj 6 (0,0):
               - X: 0.08. Sum of half-sizes for 6 and 7 is 0.09835. (0.08 < 0.09835) -> X overlap.
               - Y: 0.08. Sum of half-sizes for 6 and 7 is 0.09835. (0.08 < 0.09835) -> Y overlap.
               - Collides by AABB. X and Y overlap are both 0.01835.
           
           Consider (-0.08, 0.08).
           - Collision with Obj 6 (0,0): Same as above. Collides.
           - Collision with Obj 5 (0.08,0):
               - X: abs(-0.08 - 0.08) = 0.16. Sum of half-sizes for 5 and 7 is 0.04335 + 0.04915 = 0.0925. (0.16 > 0.0925) -> NO X overlap. No collision. This seems like a promising placement for this pair.
           - Collision with Obj 4 (-0.09,0):
               - X: abs(-0.08 - (-0.09)) = 0.01. Sum of half-sizes for 4 and 7 is 0.04365 + 0.04915 = 0.0928. (0.01 < 0.0928) -> X overlap.
               - Y: abs(0.08 - 0) = 0.08. Sum of half-sizes for 4 and 7 is 0.0928. (0.08 < 0.0928) -> Y overlap.
               - Collides by AABB. X overlap: 0.0828. Y overlap: 0.0128. This overlap is larger.
           
           This confirms the issue with the collision detection definition. I'm effectively guessing based on the observed "tolerance".
           I will aim for the largest possible separation from all existing objects, even if my AABB calculations suggest minor overlap.
           The corners and edges are the only places left.
           
           Let's use a systematic approach, trying to place the object in the remaining "open" areas.
           Surface max x/y coord for center (unrotated) is 0.08585.
           Regions occupied along X-axis:
           Obj 4: [-0.13365, -0.04635]
           Obj 6: [-0.0492, 0.0492]
           Obj 5: [0.03665, 0.12335]
           
           Consider the top edge (positive Y) and bottom edge (negative Y) for the new object.
           Let's try to place it at a Y-coordinate of 0.08.
           Candidate X values:
           - Left side: `x < -0.0492 - 0.04915 = -0.09835`. So, try `x = -0.08` (this is outside of the "non-overlap" region).
           - Right side: `x > 0.0492 + 0.04915 = 0.09835`. So, try `x = 0.08` (outside of the non-overlap).
           
           The existing objects form a "barricade" along the x-axis for a Y-range of approx [-0.0492, 0.0492].
           So, I must place ID 7 with `abs(y_center)` greater than 0.0492 + 0.04915 = 0.09835 to avoid collision with Object 6 based on strict AABB in Y. This is not possible given max `cy` is 0.08585.
           
           The only way to avoid collision by strict AABB is if the object is *never* placed with a Y center such that it overlaps.
           This points back to the interpretation of the problem: if the feedback says they don't collide, then they don't, regardless of my AABB. I should treat the existing objects as if they have "holes" or are effectively smaller for collision detection than their AABB suggests, or the collision test is not AABB.
           
           I will try to place ID 7 in corners or near edges of the surface that are furthest from the centers of existing objects.
           Let's try (0, 0.08), (0, -0.08), (-0.08, 0.08), (0.08, 0.08), (-0.08, -0.08), (0.08, -0.08).
           Since object 6 is at (0,0), placing ID 7 at (0,0.08) or (0,-0.08) gives an x_center_dist of 0, and y_center_dist of 0.08.
           Sum of half_sizes for 6 and 7 is 0.0492 + 0.04915 = 0.09835.
           My AABB collision logic says these collide in Y (0.08 < 0.09835).
           However, it's possible that 0.09835 - 0.08 = 0.01835 overlap is allowed, just like the 0.01255 for (6,5) and 0.00285 for (6,4).
           This means placements like (0, 0.08) and (0, -0.08) should be valid.
           
           Let's prioritize these central-y placements first, then move to corner placements.
           Let's try `(0, 0.08)` and `(0, -0.08)`.
           For `(0, 0.08)`:
           - Obj 6 (0,0): X-dist 0, Y-dist 0.08. Overlap (0.01835 in Y). Probably OK.
           - Obj 5 (0.08,0): X-dist 0.08, Y-dist 0.08. Sum of half-sizes for 5 and 7 is 0.0925.
               - X overlap: 0.08 < 0.0925 (0.0125 overlap).
               - Y overlap: 0.08 < 0.0925 (0.0125 overlap).
               - If the system allows multiple small overlaps, this might be OK.
           - Obj 4 (-0.09,0): X-dist 0.09, Y-dist 0.08. Sum of half-sizes for 4 and 7 is 0.0928.
               - X overlap: 0.09 < 0.0928 (0.0028 overlap).
               - Y overlap: 0.08 < 0.0928 (0.0128 overlap).
               - If the system allows multiple small overlaps, this might be OK.
           
           I'll proceed with these "slightly overlapping" but spatially separated placements.
