           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **A Path to Achieving the Goal: A Detailed Plan for Robot Task Fulfillment**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of how I'm going to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunctive goal that hinges on robots taking images, analyzing rocks, and communicating findings.
           
           Essentially, I need to get two rovers working in concert to meet the goal's requirements: achieving `receivedimage` for four objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) and `receivedanalysis` for one stone (type v2) and one soil rock (type v6). The initial state sets up the situation, and now it's time to build a specific plan.
           
           I have two rovers at my disposal: v12 and v14. They're initially located in specific configurations. Both have a camera (v10) and the ability to communicate with a lander (v9). I'm going to leverage *both* rovers because the location of the objectives and rocks is such that one single move from one pose won't give the best line of sight to everyone.
           
           Here's the approach:
           
           **Phase 1: Imaging with Two Rovers:**
           
           1.  **Rover v14 (starting at v15):**
           
           *   Move from its starting configuration to a designated *imaging* configuration called `#o3_for_v14`. This configuration is a location that gives it the best angles to reach objectives within 2m, although this will be tricky, and I'll need to compute this for real.
           *   Calibrate the camera (v10) to aim at each objective (v18 and v20).
           *   Take an image of `v18`.
           *   Take an image of `v20`.
           *   Move to an area designated for rock sampling, `#o5_v14`.
           *   Sample and Analyze a specific Stone Rock (v4).
           *   Sample and Analyze a specific Soil Rock (v7).
           *   Move to a designated Comm pose `#o0_for_v14`.
           *   Send the images of `v18` and `v20`.
           *   Send the analyses of rock `v4` and `v7`.
           *   Move back to its starting configuration.
           
           2.  **Rover v12 (starting at v13):**
           
           *   Move from its starting configuration to an *imaging* configuration, `#o3_for_v12`.
           *   Calibrate the camera (v10) for and *take images of* objectives `v17` and `v19`.
           *   Move to a dedicated *comms* configuration `#o0_for_v12`.
           *   Send the images.
           *   Move back to v13
           
           **Key Configuration Details:**
           
           *   **Imaging Configurations (`#o3`):** I have to provide specific coordinates for these for each rover since the goal relies on the `imagevisible` constraints.  The positioning of these must be calculated, based on their initial locations, the obstructions, and the objectives.

Model:     **A Path to Achieving the Goal: A Detailed Plan for Robot Task Fulfillment**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of how I'm going to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunctive goal that hinges on robots taking images, analyzing rocks, and communicating findings.
           
           Essentially, I need to get two rovers working in concert to meet the goal's requirements: achieving `receivedimage` for four objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) and `receivedanalysis` for one stone (type v2) and one soil rock (type v6). The initial state sets up the situation, and now it's time to build a specific plan.
           
           I have two rovers at my disposal: v12 and v14. They're initially located in specific configurations. Both have a camera (v10) and the ability to communicate with a lander (v9). I'm going to leverage *both* rovers because the location of the objectives and rocks is such that one single move from one pose won't give the best line of sight to everyone.
           
           Here's the approach:
           
           **Phase 1: Imaging with Two Rovers:**
           
           1.  **Rover v14 (starting at v15):**
           
           *   Move from its starting configuration to a designated *imaging* configuration called `#o3_for_v14`. This configuration is a location that gives it the best angles to reach objectives within 2m, although this will be tricky, and I'll need to compute this for real.
           *   Calibrate the camera (v10) to aim at each objective (v18 and v20).
           *   Take an image of `v18`.
           *   Take an image of `v20`.
           *   Move to an area designated for rock sampling, `#o5_v14`.
           *   Sample and Analyze a specific Stone Rock (v4).
           *   Sample and Analyze a specific Soil Rock (v7).
           *   Move to a designated Comm pose `#o0_for_v14`.
           *   Send the images of `v18` and `v20`.
           *   Send the analyses of rock `v4` and `v7`.
           *   Move back to its starting configuration.
           
           2.  **Rover v12 (starting at v13):**
           
           *   Move from its starting configuration to an *imaging* configuration, `#o3_for_v12`.
           *   Calibrate the camera (v10) for and *take images of* objectives `v17` and `v19`.
           *   Move to a dedicated *comms* configuration `#o0_for_v12`.
           *   Send the images.
           *   Move back to v13
           
           **Key Configuration Details:**
           
           *   **Imaging Configurations (`#o3`):** I have to provide specific coordinates for these for each rover since the goal relies on the `imagevisible` constraints.  The positioning of these must be calculated, based on their initial locations, the obstructions, and the objectives.
               *   `#o3_v14_v18`: -1.2, 1.0 (for rover v14 to take a picture of v18)
               *   `#o3_v14_v20`: -1.2, 1.0 (for rover v14 to take a picture of v20)
               *   `#o3_v12_v17`: 1.2, 1.0 (for rover v12 to take a picture of v17)
               *   `#o3_v12_v19`: 1.2, 1.0 (for rover v12 to take a picture of v19)
           *   **Sampling Configuration (`#o5`):**
               *   `#o5 v14 v4`: -1.2, 0.6  (Sampling Stone)
               *   `#o5 v14 v7`: -1.2, 0.6  (Sampling Soil)
           *   **Communication Configurations (`#o0`):**
               *   `#o0 v14`:  -1.5, -1.8 (for communications, V14 to V9)
               *   `#o0 v12`:  0.5, -1.8  (for communications, V12 to V9)
           
           **Rationale and Considerations:**
           
           *   **Multi-Rover Approach:** Utilizing both rovers allows for a better distribution of tasks, which seems necessary.
           *   **Sequential Actions:** The plan carefully sequences actions

User:      Configuration #o0 = (-1.5 -1.8) for rover v14 at target v9 is in collision with the following fixed obstacles:
           
           ```
           v9: AABB(lower=[-2.4047, -2.3455502384913305, 0.0], upper=[-1.3952999999999998, -1.6544497615086693, 0.40766007847975994])
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Revising Communication and Configuration for Optimal Rover Deployment**
           
           The previous plan failed due to a collision during rover communication. Specifically, rover `v14`'s proposed configuration, `(-1.5, -1.8)`, intersected the lander `v9`'s AABB.  I've re-evaluated the situation and determined a better approach.
           
           Instead of defining new "communication" poses (`#o0`), I can leverage the rovers' initial positions, `v13` (1.0, -1.75) for `v12` and `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) for `v14`.  These positions are already within communication range (4.0 units) of the lander `v9` (at approximately (-1.9, -2.0) and are, importantly, collision-free.  This greatly simplifies the plan by removing unnecessary `move` actions.
           
           Even though I'm using the initial positions, the PDDL actions still require the `#o0` parameter. So, I will set `#o0` to the respective initial positions (e.g., `#o0 = v13` for `v12` and `#o0 = v15` for `v14`).  This effectively makes the "move" actions no-ops, but it satisfies the PDDL action structure.  The `comvisible` predicates will also need `#o0` which is now set to `v13` and `v15` which will be the positions where the rovers perform their communications with v9.
           
           Next, I re-assessed the planned configurations for imaging and sampling. For `v14`, I am still planning to image from the configuration `(-1.2, 1.0)` and sample from `(-1.2, 0.6)`. No collisions with any other objects are predicted. For `v12`, I will be imaging from `(1.2, 1.0)`.
           
           A thorough collision check was performed for all planned configurations, and none are predicted to collide with any objects.
           
           In essence, I'm streamlining the communication phase by reusing initial configurations while ensuring all other mission objectives (imaging, sampling) remain feasible and collision-free.  The structure of the plan won't change; just the specific parameters for configuration definitions. The goal state remains attainable with the revised approach.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating Reachability for Rovers `v14` and `v12`**
           
           I've been tasked with revisiting the reachability of configurations for rovers `v14` and `v12`, particularly in light of reports that some provided configurations are "not reachable". This is a critical problem, as it prevents the robots from executing their planned actions. I've broken down the issue by looking at each problematic configuration and re-calculating distances.
           
           The initial position for `v14` is `v15` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`, and for `v12` is `v13` at `(1.0, -1.75)`. The errors mention "not reachable for robot base", suggesting there may be obstructions.
           
           For `v14`, the problematic configurations are:
           
           1.  `#o3` (imaging) at `(-1.2, 1.0)`: I initially calculated the distance from `v15` to this configuration (about 2.757) and determined it was reasonable. Also, the imaging distances to targets `v18` and `v20` were within the required 2.0 range. However, this is too high.
           2.  `#o5` (sampling) at `(-1.2, 0.6)`: This had a distance of about 2.358 from the initial position. I confirmed this could be used as an "above" position for sampling.
           3.  `#o0` (comms) at `(-1.0, -1.75)`: This is simply the initial position, which should *always* be reachable. This pointed to an error in the system's understanding of "reachability" or a problem with motion primitives.
           
           The main issue I'm seeing is a potential conflict between the continuous parameter values, `X` and `Y`, that are needed to satisfy imaging. If I lower the `Y` value to the same value as the rover's initial value, then I have to image targets (such as `v18`) that are farther away. If I use higher `Y` values, then there could be reachability issues to the specific configuration.
           
           I need to provide distinct configurations for the same continuous parameters such as `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`. This is in order to keep the values that can be `imagevisible` or `comvisible` to their respective constraints.
           
           To address this, I'm proposing new coordinates:
           
           *   For `v14`:
               *   Imaging: `(-0.5, 0.1)` for `v18` (`2.066`), and `(-2.0, 0.15)` for `v20` (`1.989` from image), both within their respective target imaging ranges.
               *   Sampling: `(-1.2, -0.5)`. This will place the rover close to the ground, but within the required reach for the rocks.
               *   Comms: `(-1.0, -1.8)`.
           
           *   For `v12`:
               *   Imaging: `(0.5, 0.1)` for `v17`, and `(1.8, 0.15)` for `v19`, both within respective target imaging ranges.
               *   Comms: `(1.0, -1.8)`.
           
           I have recalculated each of these distances and these values for (x, y) should satisfy.
           
           This new plan takes on the following structure:
           *   (move v14 v15 #o2 #o3) ; #o3 for (v14, v18)
           *   (calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10) ; #o3 for (v14, v18)
           *   (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11) ; #o3 for (v14, v18)
           *   (move v14 #o3 #o2 #o3) ; source #o3 for (v14, v18), destination #o3 for (v14, v20)
           *   (calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v20 v10) ; #o3 for (v14, v20)
           *   (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v20 v10 v11) ; #o3 for (v14, v20)

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Plan in Depth**
           
           Okay, here's my current thinking, taking into account the feedback and constraints.  We've got a tricky situation here.  The main problem seems to be getting the rovers to the right *y* coordinates for imaging. The "not reachable" errors are popping up consistently, and it looks like a hard limit on the *move* action's distance.  The lander and its associated geometry further complicate the issue with occlusions and limited reachable spaces.
           
           **Key Issues Identified**
           
           *   **Reachability Constraints:**  The biggest issue is getting the rovers to the necessary *y* values for imaging, around 2.0.  I strongly suspect that the implicit motion planner has a relatively small maximum distance for a *move*.  My initial calculations, based on a 2.0-unit range for `imagevisible`, suggest that getting the rover's base close enough to the imaging targets might be impossible.
           *   **Occlusion Concerns:**  The *occluded* errors mean something is blocking the line of sight between the rovers and the image targets. It could be the lander, another obstacle in the environment, or the rovers themselves due to the angle.
           *   **Sampling Strategy:**  The sampling tasks look straightforward; the rovers are close to their assigned sample locations. I will use the `(-2.0, -1.0)` configuration for `v14` to sample the soil near `(-2.19, -0.98)` and the `(1.1, -0.6)` configuration for `v12` to sample the stone near `(1.13, -0.54)`. The issue is, in theory, if a `move` action is needed before sampling.
           *   **Comvisible Requirements:** The initial starting positions can be used for communication purposes to avoid unnecessary, and likely impossible, *move* actions.
           
           **Revised Strategy**
           
           1.  **Prioritize minimal displacements:** Choose configuration points close to the rover's initial position for sampling, with minimal y displacement and maximizing x displacement. This is critical for getting the imaging action to work.
           2.  **Rover Allocation:** `v14` will sample the soil, `v12` will sample the stone.

           The most sensible configs are below.
           
           *   `v14` to Image `v18` (`(-0.5, 2.1)`):  Try `(-0.6, 0.1)` (this is close to the most "reachable" and will trigger imagevisible).
           *   `v14` to Image `v20` (`(-2.01, 2.17)`): Try `(-2.0, 0.2)` (to be as close as possible and hope it is accessible to reach with `motion`, as the previous coordinate, slightly higher in `y`, failed)
           
           *   `v12` to Image `v17` (`(0.57, 1.82)`): Try `(0.5, 0.2)`
           *   `v12` to Image `v19` (`(1.92, 2.16)`): Try `(1.9, 0.2)`
           
           **The Plan**
           
           1.  Rover v14 at (-1.0, -1.75): Move to (-2.0, -1.0) and sample. The y displacement is small.
           2.  Rover v12 at (1.0, -1.75): Move to (1.1, -0.6) and sample. The y displacement is small.
           3.  All imaging is then performed.
           
           I really hope these (x,y) config locations, although still problematic with euclidean distances, allow the motion planner to find collision-free plans. They *should* allow imaging/sampling, as they respect all object visibility and accessibility requirements.

Model:     **Re-evaluating the Plan in Depth**
           
           Okay, here's my current thinking, taking into account the feedback and constraints.  We've got a tricky situation here.  The main problem seems to be getting the rovers to the right *y* coordinates for imaging. The "not reachable" errors are popping up consistently, and it looks like a hard limit on the *move* action's distance.  The lander and its associated geometry further complicate the issue with occlusions and limited reachable spaces.
           
           **Key Issues Identified**
           
           *   **Reachability Constraints:**  The biggest issue is getting the rovers to the necessary *y* values for imaging, around 2.0.  I strongly suspect that the implicit motion planner has a relatively small maximum distance for a *move*.  My initial calculations, based on a 2.0-unit range for `imagevisible`, suggest that getting the rover's base close enough to the imaging targets might be impossible.
           *   **Occlusion Concerns:**  The *occluded* errors mean something is blocking the line of sight between the rovers and the image targets. It could be the lander, another obstacle in the environment, or the rovers themselves due to the angle.
           *   **Sampling Strategy:**  The sampling tasks look straightforward; the rovers are close to their assigned sample locations. I will use the `(-2.0, -1.0)` configuration for `v14` to sample the soil near `(-2.19, -0.98)` and the `(1.1, -0.6)` configuration for `v12` to sample the stone near `(1.13, -0.54)`. The issue is, in theory, if a `move` action is needed before sampling.
           *   **Comvisible Requirements:** The initial starting positions can be used for communication purposes to avoid unnecessary, and likely impossible, *move* actions.
           
           **Revised Strategy**
           
           1.  **Prioritize minimal displacements:** Choose configuration points close to the rover's initial position for sampling, with minimal y displacement and maximizing x displacement. This is critical for getting the imaging action to work.
           2.  **Rover Allocation:** `v14` will sample the soil, `v12` will sample the stone.
           3.  **The Main Block: Imaging Locations and Pathing:**

               *   If that fails again, I'll assume that the coordinate restrictions are correct and the problem is unsolvable. I'll include the reasoning, as there's no way to circumvent the reachability requirements with given actions.
