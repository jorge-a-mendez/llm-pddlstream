           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan that achieves `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom requires several conditions to be true: `atconf`, `free`, and, critically, a set of `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. I've confirmed that the initial state satisfies `atconf` and `free` conditions. However, the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates are currently false, and necessitate the execution of specific actions: `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`.
           
           To successfully plan, I need to understand the constraints and available actions. The challenge arises from a key constraint: I can only use action instances explicitly listed. Analysis reveals that this list *does not* include any of the actions I require to satisfy `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`. Furthermore, the available `move` actions are essentially no-ops, preventing the rovers from reaching the configurations necessary to utilize the `comvisible` and `imagevisible` predicates that form the basis of the crucial `send_image` and `send_analysis` preconditions.
           
           Given this strict limitation on available actions, the goal is demonstrably unreachable. The rovers are effectively immobilized at their initial configurations, and the required communicative actions are prohibited, precluding the fulfillment of the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` components of `new-axiom@0()`. Consequently, I conclude that it is impossible to formulate a valid plan to achieve this objective.
