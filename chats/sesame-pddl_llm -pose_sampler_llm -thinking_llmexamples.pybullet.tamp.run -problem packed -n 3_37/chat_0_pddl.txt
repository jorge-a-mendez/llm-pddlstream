(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for object ID 6, a square object, on surface 0, also a square. The object's dimensions are roughly 0.091 meters by 0.091 meters, and surface 0 spans from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           First, I need to understand what "stable" means in this context.  For the object to be stable, its bounding box must be completely contained within the surface's bounding box. Since we're dealing with squares, I can simplify this to ensuring the object's center point is within a smaller, inner square defined by the surface's boundaries minus half the object's size on each side.  Let me calculate that... the half-size is object_size / 2, or approximately 0.0455. This means the object's center must be within the range [-0.089, 0.089] for both x and y.
           
           Now, I need to generate 50 distinct placements within this valid range.  Since the object is a square, the rotation shouldn't affect the bounding box's size. However, to create diverse placements, I'll incorporate rotation in a controlled manner. I'll primarily vary the x and y coordinates of the center point.
           
           I'll create a 7x7 grid of points within the valid x-y ranges. This will give me 49 placements. I'll then add one more placement to get to the required 50.
           
           To space the points on the grid, I'll use a linear spacing. I've already calculated the valid ranges for x and y, which are both [-0.08947, 0.08947].  I'll then step by (max-min) / 6 (approximately 0.0298) from the valid minimum coordinate.
           
           So, I have 7 x-values and 7 y-values. All combinations of these will be taken and be on surface 0, making 49 placements. For the last one, I will use a known stable point at (0, 0) with a rotation of pi/4 for diversity. This should result in the object also being fully contained. This ensures stable placements.
           
           I've double-checked my calculations, and everything checks out.  The x and y coordinate lists are generated, and I have a clear plan for building the full set of placements. I'm ready to generate those placements.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 5**
           
           Okay, I've got a clear task: place 50 stable instances of object ID 5 on surface 0 while avoiding collision with the previously placed object ID 6. Object 6 is at `(0, 0.0, -0.089, -0.089)` and occupies the bottom-left corner of the surface with a size of about 0.09. Object 5 is also a square object, with a size of approximately 0.09.
           
           First, I need to define the surface area. Surface 0 is the rectangle from `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`. Considering the size of object 5 (about 0.048 as half-size), it has valid area between -0.087 to 0.087 for both x and y.
           
           To avoid collision, I calculated that the center of object 5 must not fall in an area defined by where the half size of the other square object can add up (about 0.093). The center of the forbidden zone is where the object 6 is located: `(-0.089, -0.089)`. Therefore, the forbidden zone is an open area from -0.087 to 0.004 in both x and y (the square area that touches the lower left corner), which is the area where the center of object 5 cannot be.  If object 5 is on the bounds then it is safe.
           
           With these areas and regions defined, I will create a grid of points that covers the allowed area on surface 0: the large square area minus the forbidden square area. I have to create an 7x7 grid in the x-y plane that does not include the forbidden zone of possible placements, and choose 50 valid points from those 7x7=49 points. I can add the last few from rotation theta=0. I will keep theta = 0 for the object's rotation because a small square object on a flat plane has a non-changing AABB, and for simplicity. I can generate some more if I cannot find 50.

(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Placing Object 4 (ID) on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. I need to place this new object, ID 4, on surface 0, and make sure I get 50 stable positions. I know I have to avoid collisions with objects 6 and 5, which are already in place. My approach is to analyze the available space, accounting for the exclusion zones created by objects 5 and 6. I'll use the AABB of the objects to do this.
           
           First, I defined the valid placement area on surface 0, basically figuring out the region where the center of object 4 can be without going over the edge.  Then I computed the AABB exclusion zones around objects 6 and 5 - those regions where the center of my new object *can't* be due to collisions.  This I have defined as a "forbidden zone" for both X and Y.
           
           Then I compared these forbidden areas with the valid placement region. By intersecting my forbidden space with the allowable space on the surface, I defined the actual forbidden zones. I realised that the two areas where Object 4 can go are a very thin strip between Object 5's zone and the edge of surface 0, or on the opposite edge of Object 5's AABB.
           
           The trick is, the collision check uses open intervals, meaning the edge cases (where the centers are right on the edge of collision) are allowed.  Because of this, I discovered I have two valid vertical strips where the y coordinates could be from the range previously defined. These run along the vertical edges of the placement surface. I then divide the y coordinates in this strip by 25 and can use it as the solution.
