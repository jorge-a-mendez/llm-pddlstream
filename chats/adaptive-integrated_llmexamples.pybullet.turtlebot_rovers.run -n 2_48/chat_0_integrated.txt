           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom representing a complex state. The axiom has a series of conditions that need to be met. Let's break down the axiom to understand what needs to be achieved:
           
           ```
           Axiom new-axiom@0()
             Conjunction
               Atom atconf(v12, v13)
               Atom atconf(v14, v15)
               Atom free(v12, v16)

               Atom receivedanalysis(?stone)
               Atom type(?soil, v6)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?soil)
           ```
           
           From the initial state, we already have:
           *   `atconf(v12, v13)`
           *   `atconf(v14, v15)`
           *   `free(v12, v16)`
           *   `free(v14, v16)`
           *   `type(v4, v2)` (v4 is a rock of type v2, which we can consider as 'stone')
           *   `type(v1, v2)` (v1 is a rock of type v2, which we can consider as 'stone')
           *   `type(v8, v6)` (v8 is a rock of type v6, which we can consider as 'soil')
           *   `type(v7, v6)` (v7 is a rock of type v6, which we can consider as 'soil')
           *   `type(v5, v6)` (v5 is a rock of type v6, which we can consider as 'soil')
           *   `type(v3, v2)` (v3 is a rock of type v2, which we can consider as 'stone')
           
           So, the remaining goals are:
           1.  `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           2.  `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           3.  `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for a rock of type v2 (e.g., v4 or v1)
           4.  `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for a rock of type v6 (e.g., v8 or v7 or v5)
           
           Let's focus on these remaining sub-goals.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(?objective, ?mode)`, the rover needs to `take_image` of the objective and then `send_image` to the lander. The `take_image` action requires the camera to be calibrated.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?rock)`, the rover needs to `sample_rock` and then `send_analysis`.
           
           **Strategy:**
           
           We have two rovers, v12 and v14. They both have the same onboard camera (v10) and support the same mode (v11). They also share the same store (v16). Both rovers are at their initial configurations (v13 for v12, v15 for v14).
           
           **Sub-goal 1: `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`**
           
           Both `v17` and `v18` are objectives.
           Rover `v14` can `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`.
           Rover `v12` can `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`.
           Both rovers can `comvisible(rover, #o0, #o1, v9)` to the lander `v9`.
           
           We can use either rover for this. Let's use `v14`.
           1.  `calibrate(v14, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)` (This calibrates the camera v10 for v14 at configuration #o3, looking at v17)
           2.  `take_image(v14, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)` (Takes image of v17 with camera v10 in mode v11)
           3.  `send_image(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)` (Sends the image of v17 to lander v9)
           
           After this, `calibrated(v10, v14)` becomes false. We need to recalibrate to take the image of `v18`.
           4.  `calibrate(v14, #o3, #o4, v18, v10)`
           5.  `take_image(v14, #o3, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`
           6.  `send_image(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`
           
           This achieves `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`.
           
           **Sub-goal 2: `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`**
           
           We need to sample one rock of type `v2` (stone) and one of type `v6` (soil).
           For rover `v14`, we have `above(v14, #o5, v5)`, `above(v14, #o5, v7)`, `above(v14, #o5, v1)`, `above(v14, #o5, v8)`, `above(v14, #o5, v3)`, `above(v14, #o5, v4)`.
           - `v5` is `type(v5, v6)` (soil)
           - `v7` is `type(v7, v6)` (soil)
           - `v1` is `type(v1, v2)` (stone)
           - `v8` is `type(v8, v6)` (soil)
           - `v3` is `type(v3, v2)` (stone)
           - `v4` is `type(v4, v2)` (stone)
           
           Let's use rover `v14` to sample. It is already at `atconf(v14, v15)`. The `above` predicate uses configuration `#o5`. So, we need to move the rover to `#o5` before sampling, then move back to `#o0` to send the analysis. However, there are no `move` actions for `v14` to `#o5`. The only `move` action available for `v14` is `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`, which is a self-loop. This suggests that the continuous configurations like `#o5` and `#o0` are intended to be the same as `v15` or reachable through continuous motion without an explicit `move` action for the discrete plan. Given the problem description, if `conf(v14, #o5)` is in the initial state, and `#o5` is not a self-loop, it implies that the robot is already at `v15` and a valid continuous value for `#o5` could be `v15` or a very small perturbation.
           Let's assume `#o5` and `#o0` can be used directly from `v15` or are equivalent to `v15` for the purpose of action pre-conditions.
           
           To get `receivedanalysis(?soil)`:
           1.  `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v5, v16)` (Samples v5, which is soil, into store v16)
           2.  `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v5)` (Sends analysis of v5 to lander v9)
           
           To get `receivedanalysis(?stone)`:
           Since v14's store (v16) is now full, v14 needs to `drop_rock` before sampling another.
           3.  `drop_rock(v14, v16)` (Drops v5 from store v16, making it free)
           4.  `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v1, v16)` (Samples v1, which is stone, into store v16)
           5.  `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v1)` (Sends analysis of v1 to lander v9)
           
           This completes all the sub-goals. It appears that rover `v14` can accomplish all tasks. The `move` actions available are only self-loops for both rovers, meaning they should stay in their initial configurations for the plan to be valid.
           
           Let's verify the initial conditions for the continuous parameters:
           For `calibrate(v14, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)`:
           *   `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` - Initial state
           *   `onboard(v10, v14)` - Initial state
           *   `atconf(v14, v15)` - Initial state (assuming #o3 is reachable from v15 or effectively v15)
           *   `~blocked(#o4)` - We need to ensure #o4 is not blocked. We assume it is not unless stated otherwise or derived by an axiom.
           
           For `take_image(v14, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`:
           *   `calibrated(v10, v14)` - Achieved by `calibrate` action.
           
           For `send_image(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`:
           *   `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` - Initial state
           *   `haveimage(v14, v17, v11)` - Achieved by `take_image` action.
           
           For `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v5, v16)`:
           *   `above(v14, #o5, v5)` - Initial state
           *   `atconf(v14, v15)` - Initial state (assuming #o5 is reachable from v15 or effectively v15)
           *   `free(v14, v16)` - Initial state
           
           For `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v5)`:
           *   `analyzed(v14, v5)` - Achieved by `sample_rock` action.
           
           The plan looks solid.

           *   `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`
           *   `((drop_rock v12 v16))`
           *   `((drop_rock v14 v16))`
           
           These actions are extremely limited. They only allow rovers to "move" to their current configurations (self-loops) and to `drop_rock`.
           The initial state shows:
           *   `atconf(v12, v13)`
           *   `atconf(v14, v15)`
           *   `free(v12, v16)`
           *   `free(v14, v16)`
           *   No images have been taken or received (`haveimage` and `receivedimage` are false).
           *   No rocks have been analyzed or received (`analyzed` and `receivedanalysis` are false).
           
           The goal requires:
           *   `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           *   `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           *   `receivedanalysis(?stone)`
           *   `receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           None of the actions required to achieve these goals (`calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`) are present in the list of valid actions. The only actions available are `move` (self-loops, which don't change the state in a meaningful way for progress) and `drop_rock`. However, the `drop_rock` action requires `full(rover, store)` as a precondition, which is not true initially for either rover.
           
           Therefore, with the given limited set of valid actions, it is impossible to achieve the goal.
           
           The goal is not achievable with the provided valid actions.
