User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Understanding the Task: Finding Robot Base Positions**
           
           The goal is to determine 25 feasible locations for a robot base relative to a given target point. Several constraints and considerations apply. First, the robot's base must be no more than 4 units away from the target. Next, it must remain within the workspace bounds defined by x: [-2.5, 2.5] and y: [-2.5, 2.5], however I account for a safety margin and use x: [-2.45, 2.45] and y: [-2.45, 2.45] when checking for wall collisions. Importantly, the robot cannot collide with any fixed obstacles in the scene; these are specified as axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs). Finally, I need to ensure there's an unobstructed line of sight (LOS) between the robot base and the target.
           
           **My Approach: A Multi-Step Process**
           
           1.  **Scene Understanding:** I begin by carefully analyzing the provided obstacle definitions. This includes identifying the outer workspace boundary, as well as the positions and sizes of all fixed obstacles. The fixed obstacles include the outer walls, and the major vertical obstruction at x = 0, and a number of small obstacles distributed in the area. Given the target point will be to the right of the central divider, I need to ensure all of the valid positions also are on the right side of this divider.
           2.  **Valid Position Generation:** I generate 25 candidate positions, strategically.
               *   I start with the target point itself (provided it is valid - not inside an obstacle).
               *   Then, I employ a concentric-ring approach, evaluating positions around the target in incremental distances and angles. This strategy helps ensure diverse viewpoints and coverage.
               *   If that approach doesn't provide enough candidate positions, I switch to a more fine-grained grid-based approach.
               *   I also include a random sampling strategy to generate extra candidate positions to fill the list.
               *   All these points will be screened to prevent placing a base inside the obstacles or beyond the maximum range.
           3.  **Collision and LOS Validation:** For each candidate position, I implement checks:
               *   Point-in-AABB: I use a function to determine if a given position is inside any obstacle, based on the coordinates.
               *   Line-of-Sight (Approximation): While a full LOS checker (e.g., segment-AABB intersection) would be ideal, I approximate it by ensuring the candidate position is not "behind" a major obstacle (particularly the central vertical divider) from the target's perspective. The target point is (1.5, 0), so this guarantees all points will be on the right side to prevent blocking line-of-sight.
           
           By iteratively applying these steps, the code will identify 25 valid robot base positions that are both accessible and provide a clear view of the target.
