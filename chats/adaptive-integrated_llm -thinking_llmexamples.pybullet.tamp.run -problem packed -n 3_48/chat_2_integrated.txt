User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.055, -0.406), (0.021, -0.33)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.23, 0.507, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.111, 0.994).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.234, 0.189, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.829, 0.559).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.017, -0.368, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, 0.049).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.272, 0.465), (-0.188, 0.549)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.188, 0.143), (0.28, 0.234)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning to Achieve `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, `on(v14, v16)`**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`.  Essentially, I need to pick up each object from its starting point on `v11` and place it on `v16`. Since all three need to end up on `v16`, I'm assuming there's some common pose, `#o2`, defined on `v16` where they should all go. However, to avoid conflicts (the objects can't occupy the same space on `v16`), I'll need to specify three distinct placements for the objects, all within the bounds of `#o2`.
           
           The initial state shows `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are currently on `v11`, each with a specific pose.  The robot arm `v4` and base `v3` are also in defined configurations.  Crucially, there are "supported" facts that confirm they can be placed on `v16` at pose `#o2`.  There's also a common grasp (`#o1`) for all three objects.  The arm I need to use is `v4` since it's handempty and I have kin facts only for `v4`. The base has `atbconf(v3)`.
           
           My plan is straightforward:
           1. **Move Base**:  First, to accommodate the kin constraints of pick and place actions, the robot might need to move its base from its current configuration `v3` to a suitable one, `#o3`.
           2. **Pick and Place `v8`**: Grab `v8` from its current pose (`v9`) on `v11` and put it on `v16`.
           3. **Pick and Place `v12`**: Pick `v12` from `v13` on `v11` and place it on `v16`.
           4. **Pick and Place `v14`**: Pick `v14` from `v15` on `v11` and place it on `v16`.
           
           The key here is how I handle the shared pose `#o2`. I need three *distinct* poses for each object on `v16`. I have to place them in such a way that the objects can't interfere with each other or with other objects if such existed on `v16`. I know the dimensions of `v16`, and I can try to estimate the size of the objects to find three distinct locations on the box. After doing the math, it looks like `v8` at (-0.08, 0, 0.781) on `v16`, `v12` at (0, 0.08, 0.781), and `v14` at (0.08, 0, 0.781) work perfectly, well within the AABB.
           
           I will use '#o2' in the plan, and provide three individual continuous values for "#o2" under poses, since this value is what needs to be changed for each different object.
           The value of '#o3' (the target base config) needs to exist, but isn't required to be specified. I will provide 'v3' as the continuous value, to show no base movement.
           
           This strategy should achieve the goal of having all three objects on `v16` at separate and collision-free locations, as required.
