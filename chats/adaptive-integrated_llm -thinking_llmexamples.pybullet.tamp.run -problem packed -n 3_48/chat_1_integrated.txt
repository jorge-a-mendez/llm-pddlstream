User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.055, -0.406), (0.021, -0.33)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.23, 0.507, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.111, 0.994).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.234, 0.189, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.829, 0.559).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.017, -0.368, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, 0.049).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.272, 0.465), (-0.188, 0.549)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.188, 0.143), (0.28, 0.234)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           Atom kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)
           Atom kin(v4, v14, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)

           Atom kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)
           Atom kin(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)
           Atom kin(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, here's what I've figured out. My job is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`. Simple enough, right? I need to move these objects from their current spots (which are on `v11` by the looks of it) to a new, shared surface. The preconditions seem to be `supported` and `atpose`, as usual. My focus will be around those 2.
           
           I first reviewed the given predicates. The `kin` predicates allow me to move all the objects using arm `v4`. It's all about how `v4` can pick up, and place `v12`, `v14`, and `v8` at different poses on `v16`, which will be `#o2`. I need to be careful with the `#o2` poses, making sure they don't overlap. Since the problem requires a different `#o2` for each object, I'll keep the pose as `#o2` in the planning phase, and I will define the concrete pose in the Pose section as requested.
           
           The *real* problem, it turns out, is the list of available *actions*. This is where the whole thing falls apart. I'm given only one action: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This literally means the robot can't move. Now, to get an object from one surface to another, you need `pick` and `place` actions at a bare minimum. They are not in the list of allowed action instances and, therefore, I cannot use them. Since I *have* no `pick` or `place`, I can't physically interact with the objects. This means the goal state I'm given is unreachable. I won't even try and generate a plan.
