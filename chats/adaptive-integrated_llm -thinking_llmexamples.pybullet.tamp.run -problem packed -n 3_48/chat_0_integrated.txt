           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.017, -0.368, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, 0.049).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.055, -0.406), (0.021, -0.33)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.272, 0.465), (-0.188, 0.549)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.23, 0.507, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.111, 0.994).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.234, 0.189, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.829, 0.559).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.188, 0.143), (0.28, 0.234)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom atpose(v14, v15)
           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom stackable(v14, v10)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom stackable(v14, v16)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom supported(v14, v15, v11)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom handempty(v4)

           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Infeasibility of the Plan**
           
           Okay, so I'm looking at this problem, and my immediate thought is, "This is going to be tricky." The goal is clear: get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`.  The initial state tells me they're all currently supported by `v11`.  My usual approach would be to pick up each object, move the base if needed (although the given `move_base` action suggests no actual movement required), and then place them on `v16`. The existing facts show `v16` has poses available such as `#o2` that would work.
           
           But then I hit a wall.  The problem explicitly limits me to only the action instances provided. I see a single `move_base` action that moves from the same position to itself, which is useless. The pick and place actions, the core of this task, aren't included.  I can't manipulate any of these objects.
           
           My internal reasoning quickly runs through the steps: To get an object *on* another, I have to be able to pick it up and place it down, even if I have to move the base. Because `on` is an axiom of `supported` and `atpose`, achieving the goal directly requires changing the `atpose` of each object. I need a `pick` action to move the object, and a `place` to set its `atpose` onto `v16`. Since I'm not allowed to use these actions, the goal is unreachable.
           
           The constraints are too tight. The goal *requires* actions that are *not* permitted. Given the defined limitations, I'm forced to conclude the plan is infeasible.
