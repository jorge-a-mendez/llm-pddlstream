(Thoughts: **My Plan for 50 Stable Placements**
           
           I need to find 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 6, dimensions 0.0736, 0.0736) on a square surface (surface 0, bounds (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135)). A stable placement means the object's AABB is fully contained within the surface. The object's AABB changes with rotation, but since it's a square, its rotated AABB is also a square. I'll define `S` as the object's side length, and `S_rot` as its side length after rotation by `theta`.
           
           To determine `S_rot`, I'll use `S * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. The surface's center is (0, 0), and its side length is 0.27. I can calculate the object's allowed range of (x, y) given `theta` so it's fully contained.
           I'll rotate the object to several distinct angles (`0`, `pi/8`, `pi/4`, `3pi/4`, `pi/2` and their respective values), then place the object at distinct positions within the allowed range so it is not overlapping. The possible values are `[-0.09818, 0.09818]` for `0` and `pi/2`, `[-0.082935, 0.082935]` for `pi/4` and `3pi/4`, and `[-0.086928, 0.086928]` for `pi/8`. I will pick 10 coordinates for each value to make sure each position is distinct.
           The coordinates chosen for the 50 positions are within their range for `x` and `y`.

(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Placing Object ID 7**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out 50 stable and collision-free placements for this new object (ID: 7) on Surface 0.  I've got a good grasp of the surface boundaries and the size of the object: basically, it's a square with a side of around 0.07545 units. I've also got to avoid colliding with Object ID 6, which is already placed at the origin.
           
           First, I calculated the size of the region the AABB for object 6 spans, which has a side length of around 0.073637. Then, I realized that I can use the AABB to determine areas I cannot place object 7. I found that if I don't use small angles to rotate object 7. it would be impossible to place it. I realized that angles `pi/4` and all related angles have the same AABB size. I can't put the object anywhere within the space. After finding that limitation, I decided I would only use rotations near 0 or `pi/2`.
           
           So, the plan is to use rotations close to 0 and pi/2. I have 25 placements at 0 rotation, and 25 at pi/2. I have chosen coordinates that avoid the AABB of object 6. I've used some "corners" and some coordinates within the boundaries to make it diverse. That should work!

(Thoughts: **Final Placement Strategy for Object 8**
           
           Alright, after meticulously analyzing the constraints, it's clear the only viable approach for placing object 8 (ID: 8) with 50 stable positions at `theta = 0` (or equivalently `pi/2`) is in the bottom-left corner, avoiding object 6 and object 7. I've narrowed down the valid placement area for object 8's center to a very small region where both `x` and `y` coordinates must lie within the range `[-0.0929347, -0.078884]`. Rotating the object further will lead to AABB that are too big to work with the given constraints of the surface and collision checking.
           
           To generate 50 distinct placements, I'll strategically choose coordinate values within that narrow range, ensuring no overlap. I'll construct a 7x7 grid of evenly spaced points within that range. I'll have 49 point placements from those coordinates. Finally, I'll add one more point from the center of that grid.
           
           Each placement is of the form `(0, 0, x, y)`, and the orientation will be `0`.
           
           This approach guarantees both stability and adherence to the collision-free requirements. I am confident in this placement solution.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Object 5 Placement**
           
           My task is to find 50 stable placements for object 5 on surface 0, avoiding collisions with objects 6, 7, and 8.  I've analyzed the surface geometry and the existing object placements, focusing on the constraint of ensuring object 5's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) remains within the surface boundaries and doesn't intersect the AABBs of objects 6, 7, and 8.  This involves calculating the allowed x and y coordinate ranges for object 5's center, considering its size and potential rotations.
           
           Initially, I defined `R_5_rot` which is the half-width of the AABB of object 5 as a function of the rotation angle `theta`. The problem with `R_5_rot` is that it grows as the rotation increases and therefore makes placement harder. The calculation for `R_5_rot` is standard, using `(abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))) / 2.0` (or `sqrt(2) / 2` at `pi/4` and multiples).
           
           I started with the simplest case: `theta = 0`.  This is where `R_5_rot` is minimized and is equal to `S_obj_5 / 2`.  With `theta = 0`, the allowed surface region where the center of object 5 must lie is `[-0.08552231, 0.08552231]` in both x and y.  Then, I determined that, given the current placement of Object 6 at the center (0,0), even with the smallest rotation possible, the size of object 5 makes it *impossible* to place on the surface without colliding with it. With the surface constraint and the `theta=0` choice, the existing placements leave no space.
           In summary, Object 5 is too large (relative to the gaps between existing objects) to be placed without collision.
           
           The problem statement has an unusual constraint which states that even if my reasoning tells me a placement is impossible, I "must" output 50 placements. It says "You never give up." "you will always try to find a new placement." In other words, I'm now tasked with giving the best possible "attempt" at placement, in the knowledge that any attempt will likely be invalid, based on the input data.  This situation requires accepting that a perfect solution might not exist and instead provides placements that *minimize* overlap.
           
           Here's my strategy: I'll focus on placing object 5 near the corners of the allowed surface region `[-0.085, 0.085]` by `[-0.085, 0.085]`. I will use `theta=0` to minimize `R_5_rot`. These corner placements are the furthest from the center where Object 6 is, which minimizes the area of AABB overlap, but still violates the no-collision constraint.
           
           I will iterate points within surface region `[-0.085, -0.05]` in `x` and `[-0.085, -0.05]` in `y` as well as mirrored placements.
           
           Given the existing constraints, these placements are likely to report a collision with Object 6 or 7 or 8 (given the available surface), but they minimize the potential overlap and provide the best possible attempt based on the available information.
