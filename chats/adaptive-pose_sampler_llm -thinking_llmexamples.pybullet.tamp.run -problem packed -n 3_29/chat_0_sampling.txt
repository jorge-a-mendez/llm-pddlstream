(Thoughts: **Stable Object Placements: A Comprehensive Strategy**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 4, a square object with sides of approximately 0.099 units, on a square surface centered at (0,0) with side length 0.27 (from -0.135 to 0.135).
           
           Stability here means the object must be fully within the surface, and crucially, not colliding with any other objects. Since we have no fixed obstacles or other placed objects, containment is the only constraint for now.
           
           First, I calculate the object's half-extent (half its side) which is 0.0495. When rotated, this value will fluctuate, so I must take that into account.
           
           For a general rotation `theta`, the effective half-extent of the object will be `h_obj * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. We can calculate `Hx_rot` and `Hy_rot` by taking this formula. Since it is a square, the effective extent will be equal no matter the value of `theta`.
           
           Now the core idea: I'll focus on creating a grid of placements based on the largest extent the object can take (when it is rotated 45 degrees,  maximum diameter is 0.14). I'll calculate `H_rot_max = h * sqrt(2)`, to get our max extent. The most challenging placement is when the object is rotated 45 degrees since that increases the surface area that it will take up. This means the object can always fit in our surface.
           
           So, for any rotation, the x and y coordinates of the object's center must be within [-0.065, 0.065].
           
           I'll use a two-step approach:
           
           1.  **Angle 0**: I'll create a 5x5 grid of placements within [-0.08, 0.08] for x and y, for object center coordinates with an angle of `0` in radians.
           2.  **Angle pi/4**: Then, I'll create a second 5x5 grid of placements within [-0.06, 0.06] for x and y with an angle of `pi/4` (45 degrees) in radians.
           
           This will give me 50 unique, valid object placements, ensuring full containment and therefore, stability. This grid approach ensures adequate coverage and, by using the maximum rotated size, guarantees safe placement regardless of the object's actual rotation. No overlaps, no out-of-bounds. Perfect.

(Thoughts: **The Placement Plan for Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've got the feedback, object 4 is placed successfully. Now, I need to figure out where to put object 5, and it's got to be stable, no collisions with anything fixed, and crucially, *no collision with object 4*. Object 5 is a square, similar in size to object 4 (close enough), and I've got its half-extents calculated. I know surface 0's bounds and object 4's exact location and dimensions. 
           
           First, the simple surface constraints; then, I've got to make sure object 5 isn't sitting on top of object 4 or even overlapping it. The "no overlap" part is key. Since I'm using the same approach as before, I'll generate 50 placements (25 with no rotation and 25 rotated at 45 degrees).
           
           To avoid collisions with object 4 I'll calculate its AABB. Then I figure out its safe placement coordinates and then I generate a bunch of placements at different locations on the surface, making sure they don't overlap. Since the x and y dimensions are similar, and theta can either be 0 or pi/4. I'll need to use those values. I can use the surface bounds to define a max radius. This will define the possible center coordinates.
           
           I then check each placement's AABB for overlap with object 4's AABB. Since I need to create the locations without overlap, I will need to iterate through possible positions for x and y.
           
           So the strategy is to generate positions for object 5 with no rotation, and with rotation at pi/4. I know where object 4 is placed at (-0.08,-0.08) and I also know where object 4 AABB is. I know the minimum placement can be defined by an AABB outside object 4. Then I can iterate the centers and check.
           
           Then for `theta = 0`, the strategy will be iterating `x_center` and `y_center` in some range, then checking for `cx >= 0.018987` OR `cy >= 0.018987`.
           For `theta = pi/4`, it would be something similar. To check this I will need to use a finer grid for positions to see all the places that are available. In the end, the coordinates that have been calculated will be put in an array, 
           
           So the plan is:
           - **Object 4 bounds**: Calculate bounds
           - **Object 5 `theta=0` placements (25 placements)**:
               - Iterate coordinates in the range
           - **Object 5 `theta=pi/4` placements (25 placements)**: Iterate coordinates in the range.
           
           Once I have the values, it's just a matter of checking each one and eliminating any that would lead to a collision.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Object 6 Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's my plan for placing Object 6 on Surface 0, avoiding collisions with Object 4 and Object 5:
           
           **1. Define the Constraints:** Surface 0 is a rectangle, and I need to place Object 6 safely within it.  I've got the extents and half-extents (h6) of Object 6, which are essential for calculating collision zones and stable positions.
           
           **2.  Surface Boundaries and Collision Avoidance:**  To avoid collisions, I'll restrict Object 6's placement. Surface 0's bounds limit the placement, and I'll need to consider the area occupied by Objects 4 and 5 (their AABBs). To place safely, object 6 will be at least `h6` distant on each axis to existing objects, as `h6 = 0.04733008970668562`, for the edge to clear existing object edges. To this end, I'll calculate the valid ranges for the center of Object 6 for two rotations (0 and pi/4 radians) and then apply collision tests.
           
           **3.  Placement Strategy for theta = 0:**
           * I'll place the object in the safe range for all `x` at `y > 0.01682` from both of the obstacles, I will select an `x` range of values within `-0.085` to `0.085` and use the following y points `0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08` giving a total of `4 * 9 = 36` safe zones.
           
           **4. Placement Strategy for theta = pi/4:**
           * I'll place the object in the safe range for all `x` at `y > 0.0365`, I will select an `x` range of values from `-0.06` to `0.06` giving the object space on `Surface 0`.
           * I'll only need 14 placement points: I'll go with `3 * 13 + 13 + 1 = 14`. With a y-value of `0.04` for all x from `-0.06` to `0.06`, and `y=0.05` for `x=-0.06`
           
           **5.  The final list:** I'll use those constraints to generate valid (x,y,theta) coordinates.
