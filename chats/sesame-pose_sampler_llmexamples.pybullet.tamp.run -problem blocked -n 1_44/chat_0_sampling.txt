           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single surface, surface 0, which is a rectangular area. The object is also rectangular, with dimensions 0.07 x 0.07. I need to find 50 stable placements for the object on surface 0. A stable placement means the object is entirely within the bounds of the surface. Since the object is square, its orientation (theta) doesn't significantly change its footprint, but I will still vary it. I will generate placements by distributing the object's center across the surface, ensuring the object's full extent is within the surface boundaries.
           
           Surface 0: `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`
           Width of surface 0: `4.8 - 4.2 = 0.6`
           Height of surface 0: `0.0 - (-0.6) = 0.6`
           Object dimensions: `size_x = 0.07, size_y = 0.07`
           
           For the object to be entirely within the surface, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           `surface_lower_x + object_half_x <= x <= surface_upper_x - object_half_x`
           `surface_lower_y + object_half_y <= y <= surface_upper_y - object_half_y`
           
           Object half dimensions: `half_x = 0.07 / 2 = 0.035`, `half_y = 0.07 / 2 = 0.035`
           
           X-range for center: `4.2 + 0.035 <= x <= 4.8 - 0.035` => `4.235 <= x <= 4.765`
           Y-range for center: `-0.6 + 0.035 <= y <= 0.0 - 0.035` => `-0.565 <= y <= -0.035`
           
           I will distribute the 50 placements across this valid range, trying to cover the space. I'll also vary the theta (orientation).

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single surface, surface 0, which is a rectangular area defined by `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.
           The new object (ID: 10) is a square with dimensions approximately 0.099 x 0.099.
           
           I need to find 50 stable placements for object 10 on surface 0, avoiding collisions with previously placed object 5.
           However, since object 5 placements were all successful, this implies there are no fixed obstacles that would prevent placements on surface 0. My task is simply to find stable placements for object 10 on surface 0, considering its new dimensions. The previous placements for object 5 don't introduce "non-fixed obstacles" for object 10 in this new request. Each request is independent in terms of fixed obstacles, but I should be careful to avoid known "soft" obstacles from previous *failed* placements. Since there were no failed placements, this is straightforward.
           
           Object dimensions: `size_x = 0.09899441522840569`, `size_y = 0.09899441522840624`
           Given that the x and y dimensions are almost identical, I'll treat it as a square of side 0.099.
           
           Object half dimensions: `half_x = 0.099 / 2 = 0.0495`, `half_y = 0.099 / 2 = 0.0495`
           
           Surface 0: `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`
           Width of surface 0: `0.6`
           Height of surface 0: `0.6`
           
           For the object to be entirely within the surface, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           `surface_lower_x + object_half_x <= x <= surface_upper_x - object_half_x`
           `surface_lower_y + object_half_y <= y <= surface_upper_y - object_half_y`
           
           X-range for center: `4.2 + 0.0495 <= x <= 4.8 - 0.0495` => `4.2495 <= x <= 4.7505`
           Y-range for center: `-0.6 + 0.0495 <= y <= 0.0 - 0.0495` => `-0.5505 <= y <= -0.0495`
           
           I will distribute the 50 placements across this valid range, varying the theta.
