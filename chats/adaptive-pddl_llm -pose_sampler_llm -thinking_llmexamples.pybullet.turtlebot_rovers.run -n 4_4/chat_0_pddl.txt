           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunction of various atomic facts. First, I need to understand what this axiom *means*. It's basically checking if certain observations and analyses have been performed. I see that some parts, like the `atconf` and `free` predicates, are already satisfied in the initial state. Great!
           
           However, the tricky parts are the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. I need to get images of various objectives and analyses of rock and soil samples.  My first instinct is to find actions to achieve these.  I know I could get `receivedimage` through a sequence of `take_image` and `send_image` actions, and `receivedanalysis` via `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`. 
           
           Now, I analyze the preconditions of the `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, since these are the final actions to achieve my goals. It is very clear that these actions require the ability to take, and store an image, and the ability to obtain a sample.
           
           But here is the problem. *I am restricted to only using the actions provided!* The allowed actions are quite limited: `move` and `drop_rock`. Neither of these actions can achieve the required `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.  They won't do anything to change the situation! The `move` actions simply re-state the robot's configuration in the initial state. The `drop_rock` actions involve states of the robot which will not achieve the goals.
           
           The goal explicitly requests "any action instance that is *not* in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." Since I can't use actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`, which are necessary to achieve the objective, and I *cannot* use actions not in the given list, the goal is *impossible to achieve* with the provided actions.  There's no feasible plan under these constraints.
