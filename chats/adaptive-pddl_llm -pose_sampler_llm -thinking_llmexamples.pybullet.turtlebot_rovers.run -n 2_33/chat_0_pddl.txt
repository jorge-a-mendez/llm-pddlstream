           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Summary: Unachievable Goal Due to Rover Mobility Constraints**
           
           My task is to formulate a plan to satisfy the conditions required by the `new-axiom@0()` goal. The goal necessitates achieving: 1) obtaining and receiving two images, and 2) analyzing and receiving analysis of both a stone and soil sample. I've dissected the goal and initial state to understand the necessary steps.
           
           The initial state reveals that the image and communication systems are functional and ready to be used. The rovers, `v12` and `v14`, and their respective onboard cameras, `v10`, are at configurations `v13` and `v15` respectively, ready to perform imaging tasks. The objects to be imaged and later analyzed are present in the environment.
           
           I analyzed the image acquisition actions and I have confirmed I can achieve sending images. However, when I got to the analysis steps, I encountered a critical issue. To analyze a rock, a rover must be *at* a specific configuration (`#o5`) where the rock is above it. This means achieving `atconf(?v, #o5)`. However, the only available "move" actions in the problem description do not allow the rovers to change their `atconf` state. They merely move from a configuration to the exact same configuration, keeping `v12` fixed at `v13` and `v14` fixed at `v15`. Since there is no way to achieve the necessary `atconf(?v, #o5)` condition, I cannot execute the `sample_rock` action and therefore cannot analyze any rocks or soil. As a result, the `receivedanalysis` conditions, central to fulfilling the goal, remain unachievable.
           
           Thus, based on the problem formulation and available actions, the `new-axiom@0()` goal is inherently unreachable. I will need either a different formulation of the problem, or new actions to be able to complete this plan.
