           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Goal-Oriented Planning with Rover v14 at v15**
           
           Alright, let's break down this planning problem. The ultimate goal is `new-axiom@0()`, but that's a conjunctive beast. I've got to ensure several conditions are met, most of which are already true in the initial state. The key challenge lies in achieving `receivedimage` predicates for objectives `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`, as well as analyzing a stone (`v3`) and soil (`v5`).
           
           Since the environment won't allow me to move the rover (`v14`) from its initial configuration (`v15`), I'm stuck with what I've got. The plan centers on using the available camera (`v10`) on rover `v14` to capture images and the rover itself to send them. I'm choosing `v14` as the primary agent, but if movement was possible, I might also consider the other available rover (`v12`). I'll use `v10` in `v11` mode. The core sequence will involve *calibrating* the camera, *taking images* of each objective, and finally, *sending* these images to `v9` (the lander). After some time, I realized that I would have to *recalibrate* the camera before each image.
           
           To analyze rocks, I must *sample* rock `v3` (stone) and `v5` (soil). Then I must *send* the analyses to `v9`. Given the limited movement, these actions also have to take place from the initial position, which I believe is possible. The main concern, or rather, the main limitation imposed by the lack of movement, is that to fulfill the range requirements for visibility, I must instantiate these configuration placeholders to match the configuration the rover is at at the start: `v15`.
           
           The continuous values will be as follows, since the initial positions are (-1.0, -1.75).
           ```
           --Configurations--
           (-1.0 -1.75) #o3 v14 #o4 v17
           (-1.0 -1.75) #o3 v14 #o4 v18
           (-1.0 -1.75) #o3 v14 #o4 v19
           (-1.0 -1.75) #o0 v14 #o1 v9
           ```
           The resulting plan is:
           ```
           calibrate(v14, v15, #o4, v17, v10)
           take_image(v14, v15, #o4, v17, v10, v11)
           calibrate(v14, v15, #o4, v18, v10)
           take_image(v14, v15, #o4, v18, v10, v11)
           calibrate(v14, v15, #o4, v19, v10)
           take_image(v14, v15, #o4, v19, v10, v11)
           send_image(v14, v15, #o1, v9, v17, v11)
           send_image(v14, v15, #o1, v9, v18, v11)
           send_image(v14, v15, #o1, v9, v19, v11)
           sample_rock(v14, v15, v3, v16)
           send_analysis(v14, v15, #o1, v9, v3)
           drop_rock(v14, v16)
           sample_rock(v14, v15, v5, v16)
           send_analysis(v14, v15, #o1, v9, v5)
           ```
           This should satisfy the conjunctive goal with 14 actions, assuming the interpretations are right.

(Thoughts: **Unreachable Goals with Current Actions**
           
           Okay, so the user's feedback highlights a significant constraint: we're limited to only these four actions. That's a critical piece of information. Let me re-examine the `new-axiom@0()` goal in light of this restriction.
           
           Initially, `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, and `free(v14, v16)` are already true.  The two `move` actions seem redundant. They preserve the `atconf` facts but don't contribute to anything else. The `drop_rock` actions are similarly useless. Since `free` is already true, these actions' preconditions aren't met. They might maintain the `free` state, but there's no progress made.
           
           The core problem, and this is where it clicks, is the lack of the necessary *preconditions* or actions to satisfy the goal.  We're missing actions that would introduce `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`. There are no `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` actions, therefore the necessary predicates `haveimage`, `calibrated`, `receivedimage`, `analyzed`, or `receivedanalysis` are impossible to satisfy. No matter how we rearrange the existing actions, we can't get to a state where those parts of the goal are true.
           
           In conclusion, given the limited action set,  `new-axiom@0()` is currently *unachievable*.  We are not able to obtain `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates given the current action set.
