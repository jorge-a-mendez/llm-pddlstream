           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.572, -0.238, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.549, 0.836).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.618, -0.284), (-4.526, -0.192)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable objects: v12, v8, and v15. Objects v12 and v8 are currently on surface v14 and v11, respectively. Object v15 is also on surface v11. The goal is to satisfy new-axiom@0(), which implies `on(green, v18)` and `type(green, v17)`. In the initial state, `type(v12, v17)` and `type(v8, v17)` are true. This means that either v12 or v8 can be "green" to satisfy the axiom. The axiom also requires the green object to be on v18.
           
           Currently, v12 is on v14, v8 is on v11, and v15 is on v11.
           To achieve `on(?green, v18)`, we need to pick up either v12 or v8 and place it on v18.
           Since `stackable(v12, v18)` and `stackable(v8, v18)` are true, both v12 and v8 can be placed on v18.
           The action instances show only one available action: `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. This action doesn't change the state in a way that helps to achieve the goal of placing an object. There are no pick or place actions listed, even though the state contains `kin` predicates for picking and placing objects using `v4` arm and `v3` base configuration with `g1` grasp. Without pick and place actions, the goal of moving an object from one surface to another cannot be achieved. Thus, the goal is unreachable given the current available action instances.
           
           --Plan--:

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.
