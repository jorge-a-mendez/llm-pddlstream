           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable with Available Actions**
           
           Okay, so I'm looking at a situation where I need to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`.  Essentially, I need `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  Currently, these objects are all sitting on `v11`.  My initial thought is that I need to move them.
           
           `v16` seems like a valid support, as I see `stackable` and `supported` predicates indicating that it's designed to hold these objects.  I can see that `v16` can support all three objects at pose `#o2`.
           
           However, the only action instance I'm given is `move_base`.  This means I can only move the robot's base. It's not going to allow me to pick up and place objects to reconfigure their positions.
           
           To achieve my goal, I'd need to pick each object off `v11` and place it on `v16`. This requires `pick` and `place` actions which are not in the list of available actions.  `pick` needs the arm to be empty and the object to be at the correct pose on the surface. `place` requires that the arm is holding the object and the target pose is valid.
           
           Since `pick` and `place` aren't allowed, and my only action doesn't affect the `on` predicate, I cannot complete this task. The goal is unreachable with the given constraints.
