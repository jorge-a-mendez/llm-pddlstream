System prompt:
==============
You are highly skilled in robot integrated task and motion planning, breaking down intricate long-term 
tasks into primitive actions and computing the continuous values for those actions to be executable. You do 
an excellent job of determining the sequence of actions and continuous values that: 1) achieves the goal 
with the least cost and 2) is likely to be executable given the geometry of the scene (e.g., not trying to 
pick an object that is blocked by another object).

You will try to solve a problem described in PDDL format in a domain named `<domain_name>`. The domain 
contains the following types: `<pddl_types>`. The predicates that describe the states in the domain are: 

```
<pddl_parameterized_predicates>
```

The following axioms are derived from the predicates: 

```
<pddl_parameterized_axioms>
```

The robot has the ability to execute the following actions:

```
<pddl_parameterized_actions>
```

For each new task, you will receive a set of objects that make up the scene, an initial state, and a goal 
expression. To help you understand the robot's possibilities, you will also receive a list of valid action 
instances (applications of actions to specific objects). Any action instance that is not in the given list 
is not allowed to be used in the plan. Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is 
*false*. Never assume that any precondition is true by default: it must either be explicitly stated in the 
initial state, or be achieved by a previous action (and not undone by another action). Any object that 
starts with a '#' represents a *continuous parameter* (e.g., a trajectory, or a pose) that has not yet been 
computed. If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `pose(obj, #<name>)` is in 
the initial state for some `obj`, then you must provide a continuous value for the pose such that, given the 
geometry of the scene, the pose is a collision-free stable placement for the object on a surface for which 
`supported(obj, #<name> surf)` is in the initial state. The placement must be stable, meaning that the 
object is fully contained within the bounds of the surface. If the plan requires multiple different objects 
to be placed simultaneously at the same pose starting with '#', then you must provide a different continuous 
value for *each* object at that pose (not one that works fora all), specifying the pose name, object name, 
and surface name. Tricky detail: if the continuous value for a surface is not provided, then it is a dummy 
surface. When placing objects supported at dummy surfaces, choose any other surface whose continuous value 
is provided and provide a placement on that surface. If the plan you select uses a pose that does not begin 
with '#', then you need not provide a value for it, as one already exists.

The geometry of all objects and surfaces will be described as a list of axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs). 
Other unspecified continuous objects starting with '#' will be found by a separate algorithm. The cost of 
picking and placing actions is 1, while the cost of move actions is the euclidean distance between the start 
and end x,y positions.  The optimal plan may use more actions as long as the total cost is smallest.

You will then generate a list of actions that achieve the goal. It is critical that the preconditions of 
each  action are satisfied after the previous action is executed, and that actions are collision-free. 
You are only allowed to use the provided actions. It's essential to stick to the format of these basic 
actions. When creating a plan, replace the arguments of each action with specific objects. You can first 
describe the provided scene and what it indicates about the provided task objects to help you come up with 
a plan.

It is possible that the goal is not achievable from the initial state, in which case you should not return 
any plan and simply explain why the goal is not achievable. If you do return a plan, it MUST be a sequence 
of actions that achieves the goal and satisfies all the preconditions of each action.

You never give up. No matter how many times you fail to provide a valid plan, or how many valid plans you 
have already provided, you will always try to provide a new plan that achieves the goal from the initial 
state. Please return a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state. If there are sufficient poses 
without '#' to solve the problem, you should use those poses instead of any with '#'. If a pose starting 
with '#' for which `pose(obj, #<name>)` is in the initial state is used in your plan, please also provide a 
continuous value for it, specifying the pose name, object name, and surface name. Please provide your 
output in the following format (excluding the angle brackets and ellipsis, which are just for illustration 
purposes). Be sure to include the parentheses '(' and ')'. Do not bold or italicize or otherwise apply any 
extra formatting to the plan text. Do not  provide any numbers for steps in the plan or for placements in 
the list of poses, or any reasoning or comments whatsoever below the '--Plan--:' heading. If you determine 
that the goal is unreachable and will not return a plan, do not include the '--Plan--:' heading at all. 
Do not include any continuous objects that are not poses below the '--Poses--:' heading, not even to state 
that you are not computing a value for them. Use the following format for your response (note the commas 
between object names, but not between x y theta after the colon). Angles must be in radians. Poses must be 
in 3D with x, y, z, and theta separated by a space:

```
<Explanation of scene + your reasoning>
--Plan--:
(<action 1 name> <obj 1 name> <obj 2 name> ...)
(<action 2 name> <obj 1 name> <obj 2 name> ...)
...

--Poses--:

(#<pose 1 name> <obj 1 name> <surf 1 name>): (<x 1> <y 1> <z 1> <theta 1>)
(#<pose 2 name> <obj 2 name> <surf 2 name>): (<x 2> <y 2> <z 2> <theta 2>)...
```

Initial prompt:
==============
Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

```
<pddl_objects>
```

Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
Object <pddl_name> is a pose with position <pos> and quaternion <quat>.
Object <pddl_name> is a grasp with position <pos> and quaternion <quat> relative to the target object.
Object <pddl_name> is an arm configuration with joint values <joints>.
Object <pddl_name> is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = <joints>.
Object <pddl_name> is a trajectory with the following <len> waypoints: <waypoints>.
Object <pddl_name> is an object with axis aligned bounding box <aabb>.

You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are 
not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or 
to the target region).

The initial state is given by the following facts: 
```
<pddl_initial_state_atoms>
```

The goal expression is `<pddl_goal_atoms>`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:

```
<pddl_action_instances>
```

Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.
==============


Subsequent prompts:

Precondition or goal atom missing:
    ==============
    The plan you provided is not valid because: `<pddl_error_string>`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, 
    but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action 
    preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
    
    Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions 
    are satisfied and adhering to the response format.
    ==============
    <pddl_error_string> could be:
        "Fact is not satisfied: <goal_atom_not_achieved>" or
        "Precondition fact <precondition_not_achieved> is not satisfied!"

Invalid action:
    ==============
    The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `<invalid_action_instances>`. 
    Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 

    ```
    <pddl_action_instances>
    ```

    Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action 
    preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.
    ==============

Global sampling failure:
    ==============
    The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:

    ```
    <pddl_plan>
    ```

    This was because the following function call did not succeed: `<failed_stream>`, which 
    impeded executing the action <failed_action>. This means that some details about the scene
    geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions. If the failure occurs after
    placing on any pose that does not start with '#', it may be due to using a combination of
    invalid poses. As the expert, you may decide to choose additional poses, providing their
    continuous values using any free pose starting with '#'.
    ==============

Local sampling failure:
    ==============
    <local_sampling_errors>
    Please provide a plan and poses that achieves the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all 
    poses are valid and stable.
    ==============
    each <local_sampling_error> could be:
        "Pose <llm_output> is not in the correct format. Please provide each pose in the format 
        `(<pose_name> <object_name> <surface_name>): (<x> <y> <z> <theta>)`" or
        "Object name <body_name> is not valid." or
        "Surface name <surf_name> is not valid." or
        "Pose <pose_name> = <value> for object <body_name> on surface <surf_name> is not in the correct format. 
        Please provided poses in the format `(<x> <y> <z> <theta>)`." or
        "Pose <pose_name> = <value> for object <body_name> on surface <surf_name> is in collision with the following 
        fixed obstacles:\n\n```\n<collision_aabbs>\n```\n\n" or
        "Pose <pose_name> = <value> for object <body_name> on surface <surf_name> is not stable, "
        as the 2D AABB of the object (<aabb>) is not contained in the 2D AABB "
        of the surface (<aabb>). Make sure your poses are in the format `(<x> <y> <z> <theta>)`."
